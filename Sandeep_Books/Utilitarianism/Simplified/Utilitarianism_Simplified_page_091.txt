I think this difference matches exactly with the difference between justice and other moral duties. When people talk about justice, they usually mean a personal right — like a claim that someone has, similar to a legal right given by the law. Whether injustice means taking something away from someone, breaking a promise, or treating someone worse than they deserve or worse than others who don't have a stronger claim, it always means two things: a wrong has been done, and there is a specific person who is hurt by it.

Injustice can also happen when someone is treated better than others, but the unfairness is then against the other people who are competing and can be identified. I think this idea — that there is a right held by a person tied to a moral duty — is what makes justice different from kindness or generosity. Justice means there is something a person can rightfully expect from us, and it is wrong not to give it.

No one can claim a moral right to our kindness or generosity because we are not morally required to be kind or generous to any one person in particular. Also, when people think of examples that seem to go against this idea, those examples actually prove it is true.
