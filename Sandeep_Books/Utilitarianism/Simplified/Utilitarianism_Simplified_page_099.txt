The most important thing we need after food can only be had if the system that provides it keeps working without stopping. Because of this, the idea that we have a right to ask others to help keep this system safe is much stronger than most other everyday needs. This difference is so big that it feels completely different from normal usefulness.

This right feels absolute and very important, like the difference between knowing what is right and wrong compared to just what is useful or not. These feelings are so strong, and we expect others to feel the same way since we all depend on it. So, what we think we should do becomes something we must do, and this need becomes a moral rule, just like physical needs, and sometimes even stronger.

If the explanation above about justice is wrong, and if justice is totally separate from usefulness and is something we can understand just by thinking deeply, then it’s hard to explain why our sense of justice is so unclear. It’s also hard to understand why things can seem fair or unfair depending on how we look at them.
