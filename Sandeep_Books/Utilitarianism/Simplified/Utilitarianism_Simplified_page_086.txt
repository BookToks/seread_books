Justum comes from jussum, which means something that has been ordered. Jus comes from the same root. Dichanou comes from dichae, which mainly meant a lawsuit in ancient Greece. At first, it just meant the way of doing things, but later it came to mean the official way that leaders, judges, or rulers would enforce.

Recht, the word that gave us right and righteous, means the same as law. At first, recht didn’t mean law but meant something physically straight. Wrong and its Latin versions meant twisted or bent. So, some people think that right didn’t mean law at first, but law meant right instead. Either way, the fact that recht and droit came to mean official law shows how moral ideas started out.

Courts and justice are about applying the law. In French, la justice means the system of law and judges.

It’s clear that the main idea behind justice was following the law. This was the whole idea for the Hebrews before Christianity, which makes sense because their laws covered everything they needed and they believed these laws came directly from God.
