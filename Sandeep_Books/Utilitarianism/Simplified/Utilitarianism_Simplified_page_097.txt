The feeling of right and wrong comes from two main parts. One part gives it a sense of being important and strong, and the other part gives it a sense of being fair.

I have always thought that the idea of a right belongs to the person who is hurt, and this right is broken when they are treated unfairly. But this right is not a separate thing on its own. It is just a way of showing two other ideas: first, that someone is hurt, and second, that they should be punished for it.

If you think about it, these two ideas cover everything we mean when we talk about a violation of a right. When we say someone has a right to something, we mean they have a real reason to expect society to protect it for them. This protection can come from laws or from what people believe is fair.

If we want to prove that someone does not have a right to something, we just need to show that society should not protect it for them. Instead, it should be left up to luck or their own efforts. For example, a person is said to have a right to what they can earn by fair work because society should not stop anyone from trying to earn as much as they can by working honestly.
