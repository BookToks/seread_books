What should we say about the love of money? At first, money isn’t any more special than a pile of shiny stones. Its value comes only from the things you can buy with it. People want money because it helps them get other things they want. But loving money is one of the strongest feelings people have. Sometimes, people want money just for having it, not for what it can buy. This want can even grow stronger when other things people want become less important. So, money is often wanted not just as a way to get something else, but as a goal itself. Instead of just helping people be happy, money becomes a big part of what they think happiness is.

The same idea applies to other big goals in life, like power or fame. These things do bring some immediate pleasure, which makes them seem naturally enjoyable. Money doesn’t really do that. Still, the strongest reason people want power and fame is because they help get other things they want. This connection makes the desire for power and fame very strong—sometimes even stronger than any other wish.
