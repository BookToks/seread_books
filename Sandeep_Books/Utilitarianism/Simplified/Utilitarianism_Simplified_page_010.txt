I might go even further and say that for all those people who think it’s necessary to argue about morals, utilitarian arguments are really important. I’m not trying to criticize these thinkers right now, but I want to mention an example from one of the most famous, Kant, who wrote a book called the Metaphysics of Ethics.

Kant was an amazing thinker, and his ideas will be remembered for a long time. In his book, he sets up a basic rule for moral duty: “Act only according to rules that everyone could follow.” But when he tries to use this rule to explain actual moral duties, he doesn’t quite succeed. He can’t prove that it would be impossible or contradictory for everyone to follow even the worst, most immoral rules. Instead, he only shows that if everyone did follow those bad rules, the results would be really bad and no one would want that.

Today, I won’t talk more about other moral theories. Instead, I’ll try to help explain and support the Utilitarian or Happiness theory, and give some reasons why it makes sense.
