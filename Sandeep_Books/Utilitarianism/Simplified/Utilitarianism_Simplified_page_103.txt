I don’t really need to say that even if people actually agreed to something, this idea isn’t more important than the other rules it tries to replace. In fact, it shows how rules about what’s fair often develop in a messy and unclear way. This idea probably started because courts sometimes have to make decisions based on guesses, since trying to be too exact can cause bigger problems. But even courts don’t always follow this rule perfectly, because they sometimes cancel agreements if there’s cheating or even just a mistake.

Also, when we accept that punishment is okay, many different ideas about what’s fair come up when deciding how much punishment fits the crime. The rule “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth” feels like the most natural idea of justice to many people. This rule was part of Jewish and Islamic law but has mostly been dropped in Europe. Still, I think a lot of people secretly wish for it, and when someone is punished exactly like that, people often feel satisfied because it seems fair to them.
