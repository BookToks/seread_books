People often say that the idea of utility, or doing what brings the most happiness, is a godless belief. If we have to respond to this, it depends on what we think about God's nature.  

If we truly believe that God wants his creatures to be happy above all else, and that this was why he made them, then utility isn’t godless at all. In fact, it’s even more deeply religious than other ideas.  

If someone means that utilitarianism doesn’t accept God’s revealed will as the most important moral law, I would say this: a utilitarian who believes God is perfectly good and wise must also believe that whatever God has shown us about right and wrong fits perfectly with the idea of utility.  

Some people (not just utilitarians) think that the Christian message was made to help people develop a spirit that lets them figure out what is right on their own and want to do it, rather than just telling them exactly what is right. They believe we still need a clear ethical system to understand God’s will.  

Whether this is true or not doesn’t need to be debated here. Whatever help religion gives to understanding morals is available to a utilitarian just as much as to anyone else.
