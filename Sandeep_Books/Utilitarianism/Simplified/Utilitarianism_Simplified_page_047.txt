These are the real problems, the tricky parts in understanding what is right and wrong, and in making good choices in life.

People handle these problems better or worse depending on how smart and good they are. But having a clear rule to decide between conflicting rights and duties can help anyone deal with them.

If the idea of usefulness (what helps the most) is the main reason for moral rules, then usefulness can help decide what to do when rules clash. Even though it can be hard to apply this idea, it’s better than having no rule at all.

Other systems have moral laws that all seem equally important, so there’s no clear way to choose between them. Their order of importance is often based on tricky arguments, and if not solved, personal feelings and biases take over.

We should remember that only when there’s a conflict between smaller rules do we need to look at the main rules. Every moral choice involves some smaller rule, and if there’s only one, it’s usually clear what it is to anyone who understands it.
