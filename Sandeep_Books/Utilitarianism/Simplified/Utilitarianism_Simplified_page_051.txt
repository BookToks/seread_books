The idea of utility, or doing what brings the most happiness, has the same reasons for being followed as any other moral system. These reasons can come from outside or inside ourselves.

The outside reasons include hoping to get approval and fearing disapproval from other people or from God. We might also care about others or respect God, which makes us want to do what is right even if it doesn’t benefit us directly. There is no reason why these reasons wouldn’t apply to the idea of utility just as much as to any other moral system.

In fact, the reasons connected to other people will definitely apply more as people get smarter. Whether or not there is any other reason to be good besides making everyone happy, people want to be happy. Even if they don’t always act perfectly, they still like and praise actions in others that seem to make them happy.

About religion, if people believe that God is good, and if they think that making everyone happy is what’s really good, then they must also believe that this is what God wants.
