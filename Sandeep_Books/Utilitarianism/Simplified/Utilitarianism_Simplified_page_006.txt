It's true that there is confusion and doubt about the basic ideas in all sciences, even in math, which is usually seen as the most certain subject. But this doesn’t usually make the results of these sciences any less reliable.

This might seem strange, but it happens because the details of a science don’t usually come directly from its basic ideas. If they did, algebra would be the least reliable science, since what beginners are taught can be full of made-up things and mysteries, just like English law or religion.

The basic truths accepted in a science are actually the final results of deep thinking about the simple ideas the science uses. These truths are not like the foundation of a building, but more like the roots of a tree—they do their job well even if they are never fully uncovered or explained.
