We will soon look at what these ideas really are, how they relate to the topic, and what good reasons there are for accepting or rejecting the idea of utilitarianism. But before deciding if we accept or reject it, we need to understand the idea correctly.

I think the main problem is that most people don’t understand what it really means. If we could clear up even the biggest misunderstandings, the question would become much easier, and many problems would go away. So, before I explain the deeper reasons to agree with utilitarianism, I will give some examples of what the idea is really about. This will help show what it is, what it isn’t, and handle some common objections that come from people misunderstanding it.

After getting this clear, I will try to explain the idea from a philosophical point of view.

Just a quick note: we don’t need to spend much time on the wrong idea that people who support utility as the way to decide right and wrong only mean “usefulness” in a simple, everyday way, like something being the opposite of pleasure.
