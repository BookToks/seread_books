Saying that happiness is the main goal of being moral doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have rules or advice on how to get there. People should stop saying silly things about this topic that they wouldn’t say about other important subjects.

No one says that sailors don’t use astronomy just because they don’t want to do complicated calculations. Since people are smart, they prepare themselves before going out into life, deciding what is right and wrong, and what is smart or foolish.

As long as people can plan ahead, it’s expected they will keep doing this. Whatever basic rule we choose for morality, we need smaller rules to help us follow it. All systems need these smaller rules, so that can’t be used to argue against any particular one.

But seriously arguing that no helpful rules exist, and that humans have never learned anything from experience, is probably the most ridiculous thing said in a long time.
