But a person can learn to deal with the flaws in life if they are not too bad. These flaws won’t make them jealous of someone who doesn’t notice the flaws, but only because that person doesn’t feel the good things that come with those flaws. It’s better to be a human who is unhappy than a pig who is happy; better to be a smart person who is unhappy than a fool who is happy. If the fool or the pig thinks differently, it’s because they only know their own side of the story. The other person knows both sides.

Some might say that people who can enjoy better things sometimes choose less good things because of temptation. But this doesn’t mean they don’t understand that the better things are more valuable. People often pick what feels good right now, even when they know it’s not the best choice. This happens with both physical pleasures and mental pleasures. For example, they might enjoy eating or drinking too much, even though they know being healthy is more important. Some might also say that many people who start out excited about noble things become lazy and selfish as they get older.
