People who support utility often have to answer complaints like this: that there isn’t enough time before acting to figure out how a choice will affect everyone’s happiness.

This is like saying we can’t live by Christian teachings because we don’t have time to read the whole Bible every time we make a decision. The real answer is that we’ve had plenty of time already—basically, all of human history.

Over all this time, people have learned from experience what kinds of actions lead to good or bad results. This experience is what helps us be wise and moral. People act like this learning hasn’t started yet and that when someone thinks about doing something wrong, like stealing or hurting others, they have to start thinking for the first time if it’s bad or not.

Even if that were true, I don’t think the question would be very hard. But luckily, it’s not true. It’s a strange idea to think that if everyone agreed that usefulness (or utility) is what makes something right or wrong, they wouldn’t also agree on what is useful. They would also teach these ideas to kids and make laws and rules to support them.
