The idea of fairness is closely linked to the idea of equality. Many people believe that equality is a big part of what justice means and how it works.

But, people have different ideas about what justice is, and their ideas change based on what they think is useful or helpful. Everyone says equality is fair, except when they think it’s better to treat people differently. Some people say it’s fair to protect everyone’s rights equally, even if those rights are very different for different groups.

For example, in countries with slavery, people say that slaves’ rights should be just as important as the masters’ rights. They say a court is unfair if it doesn’t protect slaves’ rights just as strictly. But at the same time, the system that gives slaves very few rights is not seen as unfair because it is considered necessary or useful.

People who believe society needs ranks or classes don’t think it’s unfair that rich people or people with power have more privileges. But those who don’t think these differences are useful believe it is unfair. Also, people who think government is needed don’t see it as unfair that leaders have powers regular people don’t have.
