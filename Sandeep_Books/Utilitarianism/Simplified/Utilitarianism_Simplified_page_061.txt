If we imagine that this feeling of unity is taught like a religion, and that schools, institutions, and society all work together to surround kids with it from a young age, I think anyone who understands this idea wouldn’t doubt that the rules of Happiness morality are strong enough. 

For anyone who finds this hard to understand, I suggest reading the second main book by M. Comte, called Système de Politique Positive. I don’t agree with the politics and morals in that book, but it clearly shows that even without believing in a higher power, you can still give people a sense of purpose and community like a religion does. It can influence how people think, feel, and act in a powerful way—maybe even more powerful than any religion ever has. The problem isn’t that it’s too weak, but that it could be so strong it limits people’s freedom and uniqueness.

Also, the feeling that makes the rules of utilitarian morality important to those who accept it doesn’t have to wait for the whole world to feel its influence.
