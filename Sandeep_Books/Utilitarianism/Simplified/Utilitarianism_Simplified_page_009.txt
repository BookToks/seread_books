To back up their claims, there should be one basic rule or law at the heart of all morality. If there are several rules, there should be a clear order for which one is most important. This main rule, or the way to choose between different rules when they clash, should be obvious to everyone.

To find out how much the problems caused by not having this clear rule have been fixed in real life, or how much people’s moral beliefs have been confused because there isn’t a clear ultimate standard, we would need to study and judge all old and current ideas about ethics. But it’s easy to see that the steady and consistent parts of these moral beliefs mostly come from an unspoken standard that people don’t openly recognize.

Even though not having a clear first rule has made ethics less of a guide and more just a way to honor people’s actual feelings, people’s likes and dislikes are often shaped by what they think will make them happy. Because of this, the idea of utility, or what Bentham later called the greatest happiness principle, has played a big role in shaping moral ideas, even for those who strongly reject it.

No group of thinkers denies that how actions affect happiness is very important and often the main thing to think about in many moral questions. But many don’t want to admit that this is the basic rule of morality and the reason we feel we must act morally.
