When people criticize the Epicureans, they say it’s actually the critics who make human nature seem bad. The critics act like humans can only enjoy simple pleasures like animals do. If that were true, then the criticism would be fair, but it wouldn’t really be an insult. If humans and animals liked the same things, then what’s good for animals would be good enough for humans too.

People feel insulted when the Epicurean way of living is compared to animals because animal pleasures don’t match what humans think of as real happiness.

Humans have higher abilities than just basic animal desires. Once people understand this, they don’t see anything as true happiness unless it includes satisfying these higher abilities. I don’t think the Epicureans explained everything perfectly from their idea of pleasure. To do that well, you need ideas from other philosophies like Stoicism and Christianity. But every known Epicurean belief values pleasures of the mind, feelings, imagination, and morals much more than just simple physical pleasures.
