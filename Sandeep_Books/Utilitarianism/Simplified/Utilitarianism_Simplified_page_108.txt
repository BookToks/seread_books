Justice means a set of important moral rules that focus on what people really need to live well. These rules are more serious and must be followed more strictly than other life rules. The idea of justice includes the idea that each person has rights, which makes these rules even more important.

The moral rules that stop people from hurting each other (including not messing with someone’s freedom) are more important for people’s well-being than any other advice about how to handle different parts of life. These rules are also special because they shape how people feel about each other in society.

Following these rules is the only way to keep peace between people. If these rules were ignored and broken all the time, everyone would see others as threats and always feel like they need to protect themselves. Also, people have strong reasons to teach and remind each other about these important rules.
