Many people still live like this for a good part of their lives. Bad education and social systems are the main reasons why almost everyone can’t have a better life.

Some people might wonder if humans, when taught that happiness is the goal of life, would be happy with only a little of it. But lots of people have been happy with even less.

A happy life seems to need two main things, and either one can be enough: calmness and excitement. With a lot of calm, many people can be happy with just a little fun. With a lot of excitement, many can handle quite a bit of pain.

There is no real problem in letting most people have both calm and excitement. They actually work well together because having one makes you want the other. Only lazy people don’t want excitement after resting, and only people who need too much excitement feel calm times are boring instead of nice. When people around 25 years old, who have a pretty good life, don’t enjoy life enough, it’s usually because they only care about themselves.
