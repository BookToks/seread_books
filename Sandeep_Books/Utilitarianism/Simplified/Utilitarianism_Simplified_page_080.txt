For example, the person who loses their rights might have actually lost the right to have them in the first place. We will talk more about this later. 

Also, the rights they lose might be rights they shouldn’t have had. In other words, the law that gave them those rights might be a bad law. When this happens, or people think it does, there are different opinions about whether breaking that law is right or wrong. Some people believe that no matter how bad a law is, a person should never break it. If they don’t like the law, they should try to change it by asking the right authorities.

This idea, which says many important helpers of humanity were wrong, can sometimes protect harmful systems because it stops people from trying to fight them. People who believe this think it’s important for everyone to always follow the law to keep society stable. 

Other people think the opposite. They believe that if a law is bad, it’s okay to break it, even if it’s not clearly unfair but just a bad idea. Some say you should only break laws that are truly unfair. Others argue that all bad laws are unfair because laws always limit people’s freedom, and that’s only fair if the law helps people in the end.
