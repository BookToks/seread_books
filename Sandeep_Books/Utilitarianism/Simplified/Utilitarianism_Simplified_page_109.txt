When people just give each other advice or encouragement, they might not really gain anything. But when they remind each other to do good things for others, they have some clear interest, though it’s less strong. Someone might not always need help from others, but they always need others not to hurt them.

So, the rules that stop people from harming others or stopping them from doing what’s best for themselves are the ones everyone cares about most. These rules are the ones people want to share and follow. How well a person follows these rules shows if they fit in with other people or if they’re a problem for those around them.

These rules make up what we call justice. The worst kinds of unfairness are when someone attacks or controls another person wrongly. Next are cases where someone unfairly keeps something that belongs to someone else. In both situations, the person gets hurt, either by pain or by losing something they had a right to expect.

The strong feelings that make people follow these basic rules also make them want to punish those who break them. Feelings like protecting themselves, protecting others, and wanting revenge all come up against people who do wrong. That’s why getting back at someone who did harm is closely linked to justice and is part of what people think justice means.
