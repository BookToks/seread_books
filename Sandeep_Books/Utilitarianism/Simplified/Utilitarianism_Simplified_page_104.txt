Many people think that when someone is punished, the punishment should fit the crime. This means the punishment should match how bad the person’s mistake was, based on what they believe is right or wrong. They don’t think about how much punishment is needed to stop someone from doing the wrong thing again—that’s not part of justice for them.

But others believe the most important thing is to give just enough punishment to stop the person from doing the bad thing again, and to stop others from copying it. They don’t think it’s fair to make someone suffer more than needed.

Here’s another example about a topic mentioned before. In a group where people work together, is it fair for someone with more skill or talent to get paid more? Some say no. They argue that everyone who tries their best deserves the same reward. It’s not fair to treat someone worse just because they don’t have extra skills.

They also say that talented people already get a lot from the respect they get, the influence they have, and the satisfaction of doing well. So, it’s not fair to give them even more money. Instead, society should help those who have fewer advantages, to make things more equal, not less.
