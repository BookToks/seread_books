If not, he uses words that don’t really mean anything: for example, the idea that a rule based only on selfishness could never be followed by all smart people—that there’s some impossible problem stopping everyone from following it—can’t even be seriously argued. To make sense of Kant’s idea, it has to mean that we should act according to rules that all smart people could follow and that would help everyone.

To sum up: the idea of justice needs two things; a rule to follow, and a feeling that supports the rule.

The first thing has to be shared by everyone and meant to help all people. The second is the feeling that people who break the rule deserve to be punished. This also means there has to be someone who gets hurt when the rule is broken—their rights are being ignored. The feeling of justice, I think, is like an animal’s natural urge to fight back when hurt or when someone you care about is hurt, but it’s made bigger by humans because we can understand and care about more people, and because we know it’s smart to look out for everyone’s good.
