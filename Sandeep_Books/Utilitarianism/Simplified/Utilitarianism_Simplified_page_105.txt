On the other hand, some people say that society gets more from workers who are better at their jobs. Since their work is more useful, they deserve to be paid more. A bigger part of the total result comes from their effort, so not giving them more is like stealing. If they only get paid the same as others, they should only have to work as much as everyone else, which doesn’t match their higher skill.

Who can decide which side is right when both ideas of fairness clash? Justice has two sides here, and they can’t both be true at the same time. One side cares about what the person should get, and the other cares about what the whole community should give.

Both sides make good points, and choosing between them based on fairness is totally random. Only what helps society the most can decide which is better.

Also, there are so many different and conflicting ideas about fairness when it comes to dividing taxes.
