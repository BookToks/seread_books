He doesn’t have the right to earn three hundred a year just because he happens to make that much; society doesn’t have to make sure he earns that amount. But if he owns ten thousand pounds in three percent stock, then he does have the right to get three hundred a year because society promised to give him that income.

Having a right means having something that society should protect me from losing. If someone asks why society should do that, I can only say it’s because it’s useful for everyone.

If that doesn’t explain why it feels so important, it’s because the feeling includes not just thinking but also a natural, strong urge to get back at someone who wrongs you. This urge is strong and makes sense because what’s at stake is security, which is the most important thing to everyone.

Almost all other things people want are needed by some but not others, and many can be given up or replaced. But no one can live without security; it’s what keeps us safe from harm and makes everything else valuable. Without security, nothing would matter because someone stronger could take everything away at any moment.
