It’s easy to prove any rule about right and wrong if we assume everyone is completely clueless, but as long as people aren’t that clueless, they should have some clear ideas by now about how certain actions affect their happiness. These ideas that have been passed down are the basic rules of right and wrong for most people, and for thinkers until they find better ones.

I agree that philosophers could improve many of these ideas, that the usual rules about right and wrong aren’t perfect or set in stone, and that we still have a lot to learn about how actions affect everyone’s happiness. The ideas from the principle of doing the most good, like any skill, can always get better, and as people grow smarter, these ideas keep improving.

But saying that rules about right and wrong can get better is one thing; ignoring the general rules and trying to judge each action only by the main principle is something else. It’s weird to think that accepting a main rule means you can’t use smaller, helpful rules. Telling a traveler where they’re ultimately going doesn’t mean they can’t use signs and landmarks to find their way.
