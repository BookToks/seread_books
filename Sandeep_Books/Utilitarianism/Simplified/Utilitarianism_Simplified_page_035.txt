If someone saves a person from drowning, they are doing the right thing, whether they do it because they feel it’s their duty or because they hope to get a reward. But if someone betrays a friend who trusts them, that is wrong, even if they do it to help another friend they owe more to.

When we talk about doing things because it’s the right thing to do, it’s wrong to think that people must always think about the whole world or society. Most good actions are meant to help specific people, not the whole world. The world’s good is made up of the good for individual people.

A good person usually only needs to think about the people involved, except to make sure they aren’t hurting anyone else’s rights or expectations. According to utilitarian ethics, the goal of being good is to increase happiness. Most people don’t have many chances to help on a large scale, like being a public hero.

Only in those rare cases should someone think about the good of the whole public. In most cases, people only need to focus on helping a few individuals. Only those whose actions affect society as a whole need to think about the bigger picture all the time.
