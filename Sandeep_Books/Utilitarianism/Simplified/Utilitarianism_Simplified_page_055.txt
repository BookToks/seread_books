But is this danger only found in utilitarian morality? Does believing that moral duty comes from outside our minds make the feeling too strong to ignore? Actually, it’s the opposite. Most moral thinkers agree and feel sorry that many people can easily ignore or shut down their conscience. People often ask themselves, "Do I have to listen to my conscience?" This happens just as much with people who don’t know about the idea of utility as with those who do. If someone’s conscience is weak enough to ask this question, and they decide to listen to it, it’s not because they believe in some higher moral theory, but because of outside pressures.

Right now, we don’t need to decide if the feeling of duty is something we’re born with or something we learn.

If we assume it’s something we’re born with, it’s still not clear what exactly it naturally connects to. Philosophers who believe this now agree that we naturally sense moral principles, but not all the specific details.
