He can use it as proof from God about whether something is helpful or harmful, just like others use it to show a higher law that doesn’t depend on usefulness or happiness.

People often call Utility a bad idea by calling it Expediency and comparing it to Principle. But when we say Expedient is the opposite of Right, we usually mean something that only helps the person doing it, like a leader who hurts their country to stay in power. Sometimes, Expedient means something that helps in the short term but breaks a rule that is actually much more helpful if followed. So, instead of being useful, the Expedient can actually be harmful. For example, telling a lie might seem helpful to get out of a problem or reach a goal quickly.

But since building a strong feeling for truthfulness in ourselves is one of the most useful things we can do, and weakening that feeling is one of the worst, any lie—even a small one—hurts how much people trust each other. Trust is the main support for how well society works now, and without it, civilization, goodness, and all big parts of human happiness suffer. So breaking a rule that is hugely important for everyone’s benefit is actually not helpful. Anyone who, just for their own convenience or someone else’s, does things that make people trust each other less is acting like one of humanity’s worst enemies.
