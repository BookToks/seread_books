Overall, a belief that focuses on how important it is for people to stop and prevent actions that go against moral rules is probably just as good as any other belief at making people feel bad about breaking those rules.

It’s true that people sometimes disagree about what counts as breaking moral rules because they have different ideas about right and wrong. But disagreements about morals didn’t start with utilitarianism, and this idea actually offers a clear way to help solve those disagreements, even if it’s not always easy.

It might be helpful to point out some common misunderstandings about utilitarian ethics, even the obvious ones. You’d think that smart and honest people wouldn’t make these mistakes, but they do. This happens because people often don’t try hard enough to understand ideas they don’t like, and most people don’t realize they’re ignoring important information on purpose. That’s why even very serious and thoughtful writers sometimes get important ethical ideas wrong.
