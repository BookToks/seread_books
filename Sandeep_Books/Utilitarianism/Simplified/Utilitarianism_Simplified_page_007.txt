In science, we usually find specific facts first, then figure out the general theory. But in practical things like morals or laws, you might expect the opposite. Every action has a goal, and the rules we follow should come from that goal.

When we try to do something, it makes sense that we should clearly understand what we want from the start, not figure it out at the end. We would think that a way to tell right from wrong should help us find out what is right or wrong, not be something we get after already knowing it.

The problem doesn’t go away if we say we have a natural sense or instinct that tells us right from wrong. First, some people don’t even agree that this moral instinct exists. Also, those who believe in it and think carefully have had to admit that this instinct doesn’t tell us what is right or wrong in each specific situation, like our eyes or ears do with what we see or hear.

Instead, our moral sense, according to serious thinkers, only gives us general ideas about morals. It is part of our reason, not like our senses. So, it helps us understand the big ideas about right and wrong, but not the details in real-life cases.
