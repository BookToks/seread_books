Both the intuitive and inductive schools of ethics agree that we need general rules to decide if an action is right or wrong. They both believe that you don’t just know if something is moral by looking at it directly, but by applying a rule to the situation. They also agree on many moral rules, but they disagree on how we know these rules and where their authority comes from.

One side thinks moral principles are obvious from the start and you just need to understand the words to agree with them. The other side believes that right and wrong, like truth and lies, come from observing and learning from experience. But both agree that morality comes from principles, and both believe there is a science to studying morals. However, the intuitive school rarely tries to list the basic principles that form this science, and they almost never try to find one main principle that all others come from.

Instead, they either assume common moral rules are obvious and don’t need proof, or they base these rules on a general idea that isn’t clearly accepted or popular.
