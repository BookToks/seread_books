In Jesus of Nazareth’s golden rule, we find the main idea of utility-based ethics. Treat others the way you want to be treated, and love your neighbor like yourself. This is the perfect example of utilitarian morality.

To get as close as possible to this ideal, utility says two things. First, laws and social rules should try to make each person’s happiness match up with the happiness of everyone else. Second, education and ideas, which have a big influence on people, should help everyone connect their own happiness with the happiness of the whole group.

Especially, people should see that their happiness depends on doing things that help everyone else be happy too. This way, no one can imagine being happy if they act in a way that hurts others. Instead, everyone should feel motivated to do good for the whole group, and these feelings should be a big part of their lives.

If critics of utilitarianism really understood it like this, I don’t know what better qualities they could say other moral ideas have. What other system could create more beautiful or higher human qualities, or inspire actions that utilitarianism can’t?
