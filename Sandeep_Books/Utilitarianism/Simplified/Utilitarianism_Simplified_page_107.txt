Some people think that everyone should pay the same tax to protect themselves because everyone’s life is equally valuable. But they also think taxes for protecting property should be different because people’s property isn’t equal. Others say that what one person owns is just as important to them as what another person owns is to them.

These ideas can be confusing, and the only way to sort them out is by thinking about what is most useful for everyone.

So, is the difference between what’s fair (just) and what’s practical (expedient) just made up? Have people been wrong to believe that justice is more important than simply doing what works best?

Definitely not. The way we understand justice shows there really is a difference. Even people who don’t care about the results of actions still think this difference matters a lot. I don’t agree with any idea of justice that isn’t based on what’s useful. I believe that justice based on usefulness is the most important and serious part of all moral rules.
