Like the other skills we learn, the sense of right and wrong isn’t exactly part of who we are from birth, but it grows naturally from who we are. Sometimes it can even appear on its own a little bit, and with teaching, it can become very strong.

Unfortunately, it can also be shaped in almost any way by outside rules and early experiences. This means even silly or harmful ideas can feel like they’re very important and right if we’re taught that way. It would be strange to think that the idea of doing what’s useful couldn’t be made to feel just as strong, even if it didn’t come from our nature.

But when these ideas are completely made up and not natural, as we grow and learn more, they start to fall apart when we think about them carefully. If feeling responsible only felt right when linked to usefulness, and if there wasn’t a strong part of us that agreed with that, we might not want to keep this idea in ourselves or encourage it in others. Without a natural feeling supporting the idea of doing what’s useful, the idea might disappear, even if we were taught it before.
