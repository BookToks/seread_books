We can explain this unwillingness in different ways. Some people call it pride, which can mean both good and bad feelings. Others say it comes from loving freedom and independence, which the Stoics used to teach this idea. It might also come from wanting power or excitement, which do play a part in it.

But the best word for it is a sense of dignity. Everyone has this in some way, and it’s stronger in those with more abilities. This feeling is very important for their happiness, so they don’t want anything that goes against it, even for a short time.

If someone thinks that wanting this means giving up happiness, they are mixing up two different things: happiness and contentment. It’s clear that people with fewer ways to enjoy life are more likely to be fully satisfied. But people with many talents will always feel that any happiness they get, given how the world is, is never perfect.
