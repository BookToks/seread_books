Now it’s a fact that people who understand and enjoy both kinds of life clearly prefer the one that uses their higher abilities. Most people wouldn’t want to turn into an animal, even if it meant getting all the animal’s pleasures. No smart person would want to be a fool, no educated person would want to be ignorant, and no kind person would want to be selfish and mean, even if those people seem happier than they are. They wouldn’t give up what they have just to feel the same simple happiness others do.

If they ever think about it, it’s only when they are really, really unhappy. Then, to get away from pain, they might want to change their life for almost anything, even if it seems bad to them. A person with higher abilities needs more to be happy, can feel pain more deeply, and can be hurt in more ways than someone less able. But even with all these problems, they would never want to become someone with less ability or live a lower kind of life.
