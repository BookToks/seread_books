It always makes us happy and feels right when unfair actions get punished, even though we don’t always think the courts should be the ones to do it. We skip that feeling because of some problems it might cause.

We would like to see fair behavior encouraged and unfairness stopped, even in small things, if we weren’t worried about giving too much power to judges over people. When we think someone should do something because it's fair, we usually say they ought to be forced to do it.

We’d feel good if anyone with power made sure people did what they were supposed to. If making the law enforce it isn’t a good idea, we feel sad it can’t happen. We see injustice going unpunished as a bad thing and try to fix it by showing how much we and others disapprove of the wrongdoer. So, the idea of forcing people to do what’s right is the main idea behind justice, but it changes a lot before it becomes fully understood in a grown-up society.

What’s written above, I think, is a true explanation, as far as it goes, about how the idea of justice started and grew.

But we should notice that so far, it doesn’t explain how this duty is different from other kinds of moral duties.
