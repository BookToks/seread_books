If certain conditions are met, Bentham’s saying, “everyone counts as one, no one more than one,” can explain the idea of doing what’s best for everyone.

The idea that everyone deserves happiness means everyone should have the same chances to be happy. But this doesn’t mean unlimited chances—life’s realities and what’s good for society as a whole can limit this, and those limits should be kept as small as possible.

Like other rules about fairness, this idea isn’t always applied everywhere. It changes based on what people think is best for society. But whenever it is used, people believe it’s fair.

Everyone should be treated equally, unless there’s a clear reason in society to do it differently. So, when some unfair differences in society stop making sense, they start to feel like real injustice. People then wonder how those unfair things were allowed before. But they often forget that they might be okay with other unfair things now, thinking those things are necessary, even though fixing those would seem just as wrong as the unfair stuff they now reject.
