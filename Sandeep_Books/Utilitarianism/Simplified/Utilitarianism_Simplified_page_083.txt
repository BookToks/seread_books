People usually think it’s wrong if someone treats their family or friends no better than strangers when they could help them without breaking any other rules. But no one thinks it’s unfair to choose one person over another as a friend or companion.

Being fair is important when it comes to people’s rights. This means giving everyone what they deserve. For example, a court has to be fair because it must decide who gets something based only on who has the right to it.

Sometimes, being fair means judging people based on what they deserve. This happens when teachers, judges, or parents give rewards or punishments. In other cases, being fair means thinking about what’s best for everyone, like when choosing someone for a government job.

In short, fairness means doing what the situation really calls for and ignoring anything that would make you act unfairly.
