It’s clear that this can’t be proof in the usual way people think of proof. Questions about the most important goals in life can’t be directly proven. Something can only be proven good if it helps achieve something else that everyone agrees is good without needing proof. For example, medicine is good because it helps people stay healthy. But how can we prove that health itself is good?

Music is good because it brings pleasure, but how can we prove that pleasure is good? So, if someone says there is one big idea that includes everything that is truly good, and that anything else is only good because it helps reach that, you can either believe it or not. But this idea isn’t something you can prove like a math problem.

However, this doesn’t mean you have to just accept or reject it randomly or without thinking. There is a bigger idea of what proof means, where this question can be answered just like other tricky questions in philosophy. Our thinking ability can understand this issue, and it doesn’t rely only on gut feelings.

You can look at reasons that help your mind decide whether to agree or disagree with the idea, and that kind of reasoning counts as proof.
