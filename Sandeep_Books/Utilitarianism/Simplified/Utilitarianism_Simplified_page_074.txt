At first, willpower comes completely from desire. This includes both wanting pleasure and trying to avoid pain. Let’s think about someone who doesn’t yet have a strong will to do the right thing—someone who can still be tempted and can’t be fully trusted to always choose good. How can their willpower get stronger?

How can a person who doesn’t have enough will to be good actually start wanting to be good? The only way is to make them want virtue—by helping them see it as something enjoyable, or by making them feel that not having it would be painful. When doing the right thing feels good, or doing the wrong thing feels bad, or when someone really understands the pleasure or pain that comes with their choices, they can develop a will to be good. Once this will is strong, it works without thinking about pleasure or pain at all.

Will is born from desire, but it leaves desire’s control and becomes a habit. Just because something is a habit doesn’t mean it’s truly good. We want virtue to work on its own, without needing pleasure or pain to push it, but the feelings of pleasure and pain are still important until good habits are formed.
