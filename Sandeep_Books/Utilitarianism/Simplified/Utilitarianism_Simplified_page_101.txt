Some people think that punishing adults for their own good is unfair and controlling. They say that if it only affects the person, no one else should decide what’s best for them. But they agree it’s okay to punish someone if it stops them from hurting others, because protecting yourself is fair.

Mr. Owen has a different idea. He says it’s wrong to punish anyone at all because criminals didn’t choose who they are. Their upbringing and life situation made them that way, and they shouldn’t be blamed for things they didn’t control.

All these ideas sound believable. When you only think about what’s fair on the surface, it’s hard to prove any of them wrong. Each idea is based on true rules about justice. The first talks about how it’s unfair to force one person to suffer for others without their permission. The second talks about how it’s fair to protect yourself and unfair to make someone live by someone else’s ideas of what’s good for them.
