In general, people think someone deserves something good if they do the right thing, and something bad if they do the wrong thing. More specifically, a person deserves good from those they have helped, and bad from those they have hurt. Giving good back for bad is not seen as justice but as choosing to be kind even when justice doesn’t require it.

Fourth, it’s clearly wrong to break a promise or go back on your word. This means not doing what you agreed to, or letting someone down when you made them expect something, especially if you did it on purpose. Like other rules of fairness, this rule isn’t always absolute. Sometimes a stronger reason or the other person’s bad behavior can excuse you from keeping your promise.

Fifth, everyone agrees it’s unfair to be biased or favor one person over another when it’s not right to do so. But being fair to everyone is usually seen as a way to help with other duties, not as a rule by itself. Sometimes it’s okay to show favor, and those times are more common than people think.
