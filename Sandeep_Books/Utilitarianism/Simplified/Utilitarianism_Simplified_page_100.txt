We often hear that Utility (what’s useful) is unclear because everyone understands it differently. People say the only sure thing is Justice, which is unchanging and obvious, and doesn’t depend on what people think at different times. You might think that because of this, questions about justice wouldn’t cause arguments, and applying justice to any situation would be as clear as solving a math problem.

But that’s not true at all. There are just as many arguments and strong opinions about what is fair and just as there are about what is useful for society. Different countries and people have different ideas about justice. Even one person can have many ideas about what’s fair, which sometimes don’t match up. When deciding between these ideas, they might use outside rules or just their own personal likes and dislikes.

For example, some people believe it’s wrong to punish someone just to set an example for others. They think punishment is only fair if it helps the person being punished.
