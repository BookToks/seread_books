If there is any main idea here, it must be that the facts of math can be used to measure happiness, just like we measure anything else.

Mr. Herbert Spencer wrote to say he doesn’t want to be seen as against Utilitarianism. He believes that happiness is the main goal of morality. But he thinks we can only partly reach this goal by looking at the results of people’s actions. To fully understand it, we need to figure out, based on how life works, which actions will definitely bring happiness and which will bring unhappiness.

I agree with most of what he says, except for the word "definitely." Without that word, I don’t think any modern supporters of utilitarianism disagree. Bentham, who Mr. Spencer mentioned, is especially known for trying to figure out how actions affect happiness by understanding human nature and the conditions of life. People often say Bentham relies too much on these ideas and doesn’t pay enough attention to what we learn from real-life examples, which is what Mr. Spencer thinks utilitarians usually focus on.
