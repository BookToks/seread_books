This complicated idea, I think, is why people often see moral rules as kind of mysterious. Our minds tend to believe that these rules only apply to things we experience now and seem to follow a hidden law. But the real reason these rules feel strong is because there’s a big feeling inside us that we have to get through if we want to do something we know is wrong. If we do go against these rules, we usually feel guilty afterward. No matter what we think about where conscience comes from, this feeling is what really makes it work.

So, the main reason we follow moral rules (ignoring outside reasons) is because of feelings inside our own minds. For people who believe in using what’s useful or helpful as a rule, it’s not a problem to ask, “Why should we follow this rule?” The answer is the same as for any other moral rule—it’s because of the feelings of right and wrong that people have. Of course, these feelings don’t affect people who don’t have them, but those people won’t follow any moral rules, including the idea of doing what’s useful.
