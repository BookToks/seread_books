Even though this rule is very important, everyone who thinks about right and wrong agrees there can be exceptions. One big exception is when hiding some information—like not telling a man about a problem with his health or not giving bad news to someone who is very sick—can protect someone (especially someone other than yourself) from a lot of unfair harm. This hiding can only happen by not telling the truth.

But to make sure this exception doesn’t get bigger than it should, and doesn’t make people trust the truth less, we need to clearly understand it and, if possible, set clear limits. If the idea of usefulness (doing what’s best overall) means anything, it should help us decide which choice is better when these different good things clash, and show us when one should be more important than the other.
