People agree that some laws can be unfair. So, the law is not always the final answer to what is fair. Sometimes, a law might help one person but hurt another in a way that fairness doesn’t approve of.

When a law seems unfair, it is usually because it breaks someone’s rights. But these rights aren’t legal rights in this case; they are called moral rights. So, another kind of unfairness happens when someone is denied what they have a moral right to.

Also, everyone agrees that it’s fair for people to get what they deserve, whether it’s good or bad. It’s unfair if someone gets something good or bad that they don’t deserve. This idea of fairness is the clearest to most people. Since it’s about what people deserve, the question is, what does it mean to deserve something?
