The points made here solve, I think, the main problem with the idea of utilitarian morals. It has always been clear that all cases of justice are also cases of what is useful or practical. The difference is in the special feeling that comes with justice, which is different from the feeling that comes with just what is useful.

If this special feeling has been explained well enough; if we donâ€™t need to say it comes from anything strange or unusual; if it is just a natural feeling of anger or upset that becomes stronger because it is connected to what is good for society; and if this feeling should exist in all the cases where we think about justice, then justice is no longer a problem for utilitarian ethics.

Justice is still the right word for certain social rules that are much more important and absolute than other rules (though some other rules might be more important in certain situations). Because of this, justice should be, and naturally is, protected by a feeling that is not just stronger but also different from the softer feeling that comes with the idea of simply making people happy or comfortable. This feeling is stronger because its rules are clearer and its punishments are tougher.
