Utilitarianism is an idea about how to decide what is right and wrong. It says that the best thing to do is whatever brings the most happiness to the most people.

John Stuart Mill, who lived a long time ago, explained this idea in a book from 1879. He believed that making the most people happy is the best goal for everyone.

This means when you have to make a choice, you should think about what will help the most people feel good or avoid pain. That way, you make the world a better place for everyone.
