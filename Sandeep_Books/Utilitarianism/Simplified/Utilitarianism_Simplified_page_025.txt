When someone says it’s impossible for people to be happy, that’s either just arguing over words or a big exaggeration. If happiness means feeling super excited and happy all the time, then yeah, that’s not possible. 

Feelings like that only last for a short time—sometimes just moments, or maybe hours or days with breaks in between. They’re like bright flashes of joy, not something that stays steady forever. 

Philosophers who said happiness is the goal of life knew this just as well as the people who make fun of them. The happiness they talked about wasn’t a life full of nonstop excitement, but moments of joy in a life with few and short pains, lots of different pleasures, and mostly doing things actively instead of just waiting around. 

They also believed it’s important not to expect more from life than it can actually give. For those lucky enough to live like this, their life has always felt truly happy.
