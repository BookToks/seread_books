Right now, people aren’t advanced enough to feel complete sympathy for everyone else. Because of this, they can’t always agree on how to live their lives. But if someone cares about others even a little, they won’t think of other people as enemies competing for happiness. They don’t want others to fail just so they can succeed.

Every person naturally feels like they are part of a group. This makes them want their feelings and goals to match up with others. Even if people have different opinions or ways of thinking, and even if they don’t agree with or challenge others’ feelings, they still need to believe that their true goals don’t clash. They should feel like they are not against what others really want, which is to be happy and do well, but that they are helping with that.

For most people, this feeling is weaker than selfish feelings, or it might not even be there. But for those who do have it, it feels natural. They don’t see it as just something they were taught or a rule forced on them by society. Instead, they see it as a part of themselves they wouldn’t want to lose.
