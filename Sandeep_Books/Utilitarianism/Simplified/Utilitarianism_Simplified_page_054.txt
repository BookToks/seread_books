Morality doesn’t really affect people unless there are outside rules or punishments. But feelings about right and wrong are part of human nature, and we know from experience that they can have a strong effect on people when they are properly developed. There’s no good reason why these feelings can’t be just as strong when linked to usefulness or practical benefits as they are with any other moral rules.

Some people think that if someone believes moral duties are real and exist outside of us, they will follow them more than someone who thinks they’re just personal feelings inside our minds. But no matter what someone believes about this, the real power that pushes them to act comes from their own feelings, and how strong those feelings are. For example, many people believe God is real, but their behavior is mostly influenced by their personal religious feelings and the hope of reward or punishment.

When people care about doing the right thing without expecting anything in return, that motivation comes from inside their own minds. Transcendental moralists say this motivation only exists because people believe it comes from outside the mind. But if someone thinks their conscience is just a feeling inside their own mind, they might decide that when that feeling goes away, the duty to do right also disappears. They might also choose to ignore the feeling if it bothers them and try to get rid of it.
