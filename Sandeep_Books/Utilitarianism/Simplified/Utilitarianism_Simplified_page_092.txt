If a moral thinker tries to say that people as a whole, but not each person, have the right to get all the good we can do for them, they are mixing up kindness with fairness. They have to say that we owe our best efforts to others, like it's a debt. Or they have to say that the least we can do is pay back society for what it gives us, which is like showing thanks. Both of these ideas are about fairness, not kindness. When there is a right involved, it is about fairness, not the good feeling of being kind. If someone doesn’t see the difference between fairness and all of morality, they end up mixing everything into fairness only.

Now that we have tried to figure out what makes justice special, we can ask if the feeling we get about justice comes from nature or if it grew from the idea itself. We especially want to know if this feeling started because justice is useful for everyone.

I think the feeling doesn’t come from what we usually call usefulness. But even though the feeling itself isn’t about usefulness, the good part of it is.
