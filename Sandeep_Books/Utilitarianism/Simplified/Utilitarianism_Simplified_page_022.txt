We shouldn’t hesitate to trust this idea about the quality of pleasures because there’s no better way to judge even how much pleasure or pain there is. How can we tell which pain is worse or which pleasure feels stronger except by asking people who have experienced both?

Pain and pleasure aren’t all the same, and pain is very different from pleasure. How can we decide if a certain pleasure is worth the pain it might cause, except by trusting the feelings and opinions of those who have gone through both?

So, when people say that pleasures from higher mental activities are better, not just stronger, than pleasures from basic animal desires, we should listen to them.

I’ve focused on this because it’s important to understand happiness as a guide for how people should act. But you don’t have to fully agree with this idea to accept the idea that the best actions are those that create the most happiness overall.

Even if a good person isn’t always happier because of being good, there’s no doubt that being good makes others happier and that the whole world benefits a lot from it.
