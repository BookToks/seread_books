Habits are what make our feelings and actions predictable. People need to be sure they can count on how others feel and act, and we also need to trust ourselves. That’s why it’s important to develop the habit of wanting to do the right thing.  

This way of wanting to do right isn’t good by itself, but it helps us do good things. This fits with the idea that nothing is truly good for people unless it brings pleasure or helps avoid pain.  

If this idea is true, then the principle of utility is proven. But whether it is true or not is something the reader should think about.  

For a long time, one big problem with the idea that happiness or usefulness decides what’s right and wrong has been the idea of justice. The strong feeling and clear idea that comes with the word “justice” seems like something natural and absolute. Many people think justice must exist in nature as something real and totally different from just what’s useful. Even though justice is often connected to what’s useful, it seems like they are different in theory.
