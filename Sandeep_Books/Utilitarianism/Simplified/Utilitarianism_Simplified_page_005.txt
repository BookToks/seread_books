Since the very beginning of philosophy, people have asked about the summum bonum, which means the highest good, or in other words, what morals are based on. This question has been seen as the main problem in deep thinking. It has interested the smartest minds and made them form different groups, all arguing strongly against each other.

Even after more than two thousand years, these arguments are still going on. Philosophers are still divided into the same groups, and neither they nor most people agree on the answer. This is just like when the young Socrates listened to the older Protagoras and debated about ideas, with Socrates supporting utilitarianism against the common morality of the sophists.
