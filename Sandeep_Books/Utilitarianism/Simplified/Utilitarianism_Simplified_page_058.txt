People naturally want to get along and be connected with others. This feeling is really strong and, when we agree that everyone's happiness matters, it becomes the main idea behind doing what is right. 

Humans have a natural desire to be part of a group, and this feeling gets stronger as societies grow and change over time. Being social is normal and important for people, so much that we usually think of ourselves as part of a group, not alone. 

As people move away from living like wild animals, they become even more connected to their communities. Because of this, being part of society is a big part of what life means for everyone. 

Living together in society only works if everyoneâ€™s needs and interests are considered, except in cases like master and slave, which are different.
