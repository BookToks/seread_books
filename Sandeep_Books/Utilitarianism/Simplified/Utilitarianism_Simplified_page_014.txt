Most people, including many writers—not just in newspapers and magazines but also in serious books—often make a simple mistake. They hear the word "utilitarian" and, without really understanding it, use it to mean ignoring or rejecting some kinds of pleasure, like beauty, decoration, or fun.

Sometimes, people even use the word "utilitarian" as a compliment, thinking it means being better than silly or short-term pleasures. But this wrong use is the only way most people know the word today, and it’s how young people learn what it means.

The people who first used the word, though they stopped using it for a long time, might feel they need to start using it again to save it from being misunderstood and abused.

The main idea behind utilitarianism, or the Greatest Happiness Principle, is that actions are right if they increase happiness and wrong if they cause the opposite of happiness.
