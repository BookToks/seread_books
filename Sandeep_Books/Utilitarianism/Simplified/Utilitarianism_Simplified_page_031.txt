Respect goes to those who give up their own fun in life if it helps make the world a happier place. But if someone does it, or says they do it, for any other reason, they don’t deserve more praise than a monk sitting alone on a pillar. They might show what people can do, but they are not exactly role models for how people should live.

Even though the world isn’t perfect, and giving up your own happiness completely rarely helps others the most, I admit that being ready to make that sacrifice is one of the greatest qualities a person can have right now. I’ll also say something that might sound strange: being able to live without happiness can actually give you the best chance to find real happiness.

This is because knowing you don’t need happiness to survive helps you stay strong no matter what happens. When you feel this way, bad luck or hard times can’t break you. This feeling frees you from worrying too much about life’s problems and lets you, like the old Stoics during tough times in ancient Rome, calmly enjoy what good things you can, without stressing about how long they will last or when they will end.
