A fair society can only work if everyone’s interests are treated equally. Since in every civilized place, except for a king or queen with total power, people have equals, everyone has to live with others on these fair terms. Over time, people get closer to living in a way where they can’t ignore other people’s interests.

Because of this, people grow up thinking it’s impossible to completely ignore what others want or need. They have to avoid causing serious harm to others and, at least to protect themselves, live in a way that fights against unfair treatment. People also get used to working with others and aiming for a group goal, not just their own.

When they work together, their goals become linked with others’ goals. For a while, they feel like other people’s interests are their own. The stronger the social bonds and the healthier the society, the more each person cares about helping others. This also makes them feel more connected to others’ well-being or at least care more about it in real ways.
