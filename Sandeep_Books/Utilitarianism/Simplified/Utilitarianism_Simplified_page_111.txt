The idea of giving each person what they deserve—good things for good actions and punishment for bad ones—is part of what we call Justice. This idea is very important and makes people respect justice more than just doing what is convenient.

Many rules about justice that people use every day are meant to help put this idea into practice. For example, a person is only responsible for what they do on purpose or could have stopped; it’s unfair to punish someone without hearing their side; and the punishment should fit the crime. These rules help make sure that punishment is fair and not just given without a good reason.

Most of these rules come from courts, which have worked out the best ways to punish people when needed and give everyone what they deserve.

The most important quality a judge must have is being fair to everyone. This fairness is necessary for all other parts of justice to happen.
