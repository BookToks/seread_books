All the power of rewards and punishments from outside, whether physical or emotional, and whether from God or other people, along with everything in human nature that can care about these things without selfish reasons, helps support doing what’s best for everyone. This works better the more people accept this idea, and even more when education and culture focus on it.

That’s about outside reasons. Inside, the feeling of duty is the same no matter what we think duty means—it’s a feeling in our mind. When we break a duty, we feel some pain or discomfort. In people who are well taught, this feeling can be so strong that it feels impossible to do wrong in serious cases.

This feeling, when it’s not selfish and connects with the pure idea of duty—not just a certain rule or situation—is what we call Conscience. But in real life, conscience is mixed up with other feelings like sympathy, love, fear, religious beliefs, memories from childhood and our past, pride, wanting others to respect us, and sometimes even feeling bad about ourselves.
