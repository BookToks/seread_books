These ideas are about how we judge people, not just their actions. Utilitarianism doesn’t say that the only thing we care about in people is whether their actions are right or wrong. 

The Stoics, who had a different way of thinking, believed that having virtue was everything. They said if someone has virtue, they have everything—they are rich, beautiful, and powerful. But utilitarianism doesn’t make this kind of claim about virtue.

Utilitarians know that there are other good qualities and things besides virtue, and they think these also matter a lot. They also understand that doing the right thing doesn’t always mean a person has a good character, and sometimes bad actions come from qualities that are actually good.

When this happens, it changes how they judge the person, not the action itself.

I agree that utilitarians believe the best way to show a good character over time is by doing good actions. They also refuse to say someone’s mind is good if it mostly leads to bad behavior.
