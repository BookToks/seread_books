This idea does not go against the Happiness principle at all. Happiness comes from many different things, and each one is good by itself, not just because it adds to overall happiness. The principle of utility doesn’t say that any one pleasure, like music, or any relief from pain, like being healthy, is only wanted because it helps make everyone happy.

They are wanted and good on their own; they are both a way to happiness and part of what happiness is. According to utilitarianism, virtue is not originally part of happiness, but it can become part of it. People who love virtue for its own sake want it and value it not just as a way to be happy, but as part of their happiness itself.

To explain this more, remember that virtue is not the only thing that starts as just a means to something else. If it didn’t lead to anything else, it might not matter. But because it is connected to what it leads to, people come to want it for its own sake, and they want it very strongly.
