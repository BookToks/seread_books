When people choose not to do something because they think it’s wrong, even if doing it might help in that one situation, they should still understand that if everyone did it, it would be harmful. This is why they must avoid doing it. Caring about what’s good for everyone is something all moral systems expect because they all tell us not to do things that clearly hurt society.

The same idea answers another common criticism of utilitarianism, which is a way of thinking about right and wrong. Some people say utilitarianism makes people cold and uncaring, only focused on the results of actions, and not on who does them or their feelings. But if this means that people don’t judge an action as right or wrong based on whether the person is good or bad, then this is a problem with any moral system, not just utilitarianism. No ethical rule says an action is good or bad just because a good or bad person did it, or because the person has certain qualities like kindness or bravery.
