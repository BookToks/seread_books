To do that, it seems you would need to show not only that people want to be happy, but also that they never want anything else. But it’s clear that people do want things that are different from happiness.

For example, they want to be good and avoid being bad just as much as they want pleasure and to avoid pain. Wanting to be good isn’t something everyone feels all the time, but it’s still a real thing, just like wanting to be happy. Because of this, some people who don’t agree with the idea that happiness is the main goal think that there are other goals besides happiness, and that happiness isn’t the only way to tell if something is right or wrong.

But does the idea of utilitarianism say that people don’t want to be good, or that being good isn’t something worth wanting?

No, it actually says the opposite. It says that being good is something people should want, and they should want it for its own sake. Even though utilitarians believe that actions are good because they help reach some other goal, they still agree that being good is one of the most important things that help achieve that goal. They also believe that it’s possible for someone to want to be good just because it’s good, without thinking about what comes after. They say that a person’s mind isn’t in the right place—meaning not in line with what helps most people be happy—unless they love being good for its own sake, even if being good doesn’t always lead to other good results.
