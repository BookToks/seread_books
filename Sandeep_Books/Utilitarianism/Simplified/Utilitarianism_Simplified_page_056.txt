If there is anything natural in people, I don’t see why that feeling shouldn’t be caring about the happiness and pain of others. If there is any moral rule that we just know is right, I think it has to be this one. If that’s true, then the idea of doing what feels right would match up with the idea of doing what brings the most happiness, and there would be no fight between these ideas.

Even now, those who believe in natural moral rules already agree that a big part of being moral is caring about other people’s interests. So, if believing that moral rules come from some higher source makes people follow them more, then the idea of caring about others’ happiness already has that advantage.

On the other hand, if, like I believe, moral feelings aren’t something we’re born with but something we learn, that doesn’t mean they are any less natural. It’s natural for humans to learn how to talk, think, build cities, and farm, even though these skills aren’t there from birth. Moral feelings aren’t part of our nature in the sense that everyone is born with them, but sadly, even the people who believe morals come from a higher power admit this is true.
