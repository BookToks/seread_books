Why should we follow a certain rule? More exactly, where does its power to make us obey come from? Answering this question is an important part of studying morals. 

People often use this question as a problem especially against utilitarianism, but actually, it applies to all moral rules. It comes up whenever someone is asked to accept a new moral rule or idea that they are not used to.

The usual morals we learn from family and society feel like they must be followed all by themselves. So, when someone says that these morals come from a general idea that doesn’t have the same strong feeling around it, it feels strange. It seems like the new ideas don’t make sense because they seem weaker than the original morals. It’s like the rules work better without the new ideas that are supposed to support them.
