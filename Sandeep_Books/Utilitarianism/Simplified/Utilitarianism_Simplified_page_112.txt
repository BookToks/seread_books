But this is not the only reason why ideas about equality and fairness are seen as very important rules for how people should behave. Many people, including smart thinkers, believe these ideas are part of what justice means.

One way to understand this is to think about the idea that we should treat people based on what they deserve. If it’s right to reward good behavior and punish bad behavior, then it makes sense that we should treat everyone who has done equally good things equally well, unless there is a better reason not to. Society should also treat people equally when they have all done equally good things. This is the best basic rule for fairness in society, and all rules and good citizens should try their best to follow it.

But this big moral rule comes from an even deeper idea. It’s not just a conclusion from other smaller ideas. It comes directly from the main idea of morals, which is called Utility or the Greatest-Happiness Principle. This principle doesn’t mean anything useful unless we believe that one person’s happiness counts just as much as another person’s happiness, assuming their happiness is equal in amount and type.
