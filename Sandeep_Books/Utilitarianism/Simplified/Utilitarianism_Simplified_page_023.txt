Utilitarianism can only reach its goal if people generally develop good and kind character. Even if each person only benefits from the good character of others, and their own happiness seems like a loss compared to the benefit, this idea is so strange that it doesnâ€™t need to be argued against.

The Greatest Happiness Principle says that the main goal, which makes everything else worth wanting (whether for ourselves or others), is to live a life with as little pain as possible and as much happiness as possible. This happiness should be good in both amount and quality. The quality of happiness is judged by those who have experienced different kinds and know how to compare them.

Since this is what people want from their actions, it also sets the rules for what is right and wrong. Morality, then, means the rules we follow to make sure that everyone can have this kind of happy life as much as possible. This should apply not just to humans, but to all creatures that can feel pain and pleasure, as much as possible.
