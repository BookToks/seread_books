It's important to look closely at this because people usually agree that justice is part of what is generally useful or good. But the feeling of justice inside us is different from just wanting something to be useful. Justice feels stronger and more urgent, so people have a hard time thinking that it’s just a type of usefulness. They often believe it comes from something completely different.

To understand this better, we need to figure out what makes justice or injustice special. We should ask if there is any quality that all unfair actions share (since justice is often explained by looking at what’s unfair). This helps us see why some actions are called unjust, while others are just disapproved of but not called unjust.

If everything people call just or unjust has some common feature, we can see if that feature can explain why people feel so strongly about justice based on how emotions usually work. Or, if the feeling of justice can’t be explained this way, maybe it’s something built into human nature in a special way.
