Doing good for good is a part of being fair. Even though it’s easy to see why this is important in society and it feels natural, it doesn’t seem connected to harm or injury at first. But this connection is real, even if it’s not obvious.

If someone accepts help but doesn’t return it when it’s needed, they actually cause harm. They let down a natural and fair expectation, one they probably encouraged by accepting the help in the first place.

Disappointing someone’s expectations is a big problem. It’s why breaking a friendship or a promise is seen as very wrong. Few things hurt people more than when someone they trusted lets them down when they really need help. This kind of unfairness causes strong anger in both the person hurt and anyone watching.
