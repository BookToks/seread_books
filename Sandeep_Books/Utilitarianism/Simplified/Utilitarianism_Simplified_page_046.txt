Most of the remaining complaints against utilitarianism come from common human weaknesses and the tough choices people face when trying to live a good life. People say that a utilitarian might think their own situation is special and decide to break moral rules if they believe it will lead to better results.

But is it only utilitarianism that gives people excuses to do wrong and trick their conscience? No, all moral systems that accept there are often conflicting reasons in making choices do the same. Every system that sane people believe in knows this.

It’s not the fault of any moral system that rules can’t be made without exceptions. Almost no action can be said to be always right or always wrong. Every ethical system allows some flexibility, trusting people to be responsible and adapt to different situations.

Unfortunately, this flexibility also lets people fool themselves and make dishonest excuses. There is no moral system without clear cases where duties conflict with each other.
