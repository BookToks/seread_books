According to the idea of utilitarianism, being good or having virtue is something valuable because it helps bring pleasure and keep pain away. At first, people don’t want to be good just for being good, but because it makes them feel happy or avoids pain. Over time, people start to see being good as something valuable on its own and want it as much as other things they like.

But being good is different from wanting money, power, or fame. Those things can sometimes hurt others around you, while being good makes you a blessing to the people in your community. So, utilitarianism accepts wanting money, power, or fame only as long as it doesn’t cause more harm than good. At the same time, it strongly encourages everyone to love and practice being good because this is the most important thing for making everyone happy.

From this, we see that what people really want is happiness. If someone wants something else, it’s only because they believe it will lead to happiness. When people want to be good for its own sake, it’s because feeling good about being good brings them pleasure, or because feeling bad about not being good causes pain—or both. Usually, people feel both pleasure and pain together when they think about how good they are or how much better they could be.
