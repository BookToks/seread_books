People who don’t agree with utilitarianism aren’t always unfair when they talk about it. Some of them understand that it’s meant to be fair and caring, but they think its standards are too hard for people to meet.

They say it’s asking too much to expect people to always act to help society as a whole. But this is misunderstanding what a moral standard really means. It mixes up what we should do with why we do it. Ethics is about telling us what our duties are and how to recognize them. It doesn’t say we have to do everything just because we feel it’s our duty. In fact, most of what we do is for other reasons, and that’s okay as long as our duties don’t say it’s wrong.

It’s even more unfair to blame utilitarianism for this mistake because utilitarian thinkers have been clearer than almost anyone else. They say that why you do something doesn’t decide if the action is right or wrong, though it does say something about the person doing it.
