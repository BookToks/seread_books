The Owenite says it’s wrong to punish someone for something they can’t control. Each person feels sure they are right as long as they only think about their own idea of what’s fair. But when different ideas about fairness meet, everyone has good points, and no one can prove they’re completely right.  

No one can follow their own idea of fairness without going against another important rule. These problems have always been known, and many ways have been made up to avoid dealing with them directly.  

To avoid the last problem, people came up with the idea of “free will.” They thought it would be unfair to punish someone if their bad choices were caused by things outside their control.  

To deal with the other problems, people invented the idea of a “social contract.” This means everyone in society agreed, at some unknown time, to follow the rules and accept punishment if they break them. This gave lawmakers the right to punish people, which they wouldn’t have had otherwise.  

This idea was seen as a smart way to solve the problem and make punishment fair because it’s based on the rule that it’s not unfair to do something if the person agrees to it.
