We know that feeling justice involves two main things: wanting to punish someone who has done something wrong, and knowing that there is a specific person who was hurt.

I think the desire to punish someone who harms another comes naturally from two strong feelings, which are like instincts. These are the need to protect ourselves and the feeling of caring for others.

It’s normal to be upset and want to fight back when someone hurts us or people we care about. We don’t need to explain where this feeling comes from. Whether it is an instinct or something we learn, it happens in all animals. Every animal tries to hurt those who have hurt or might hurt itself or its babies. People are different from animals in two ways. First, people can care not just about their own kids or animals that are nice to them, but about all humans and even all feeling creatures.
