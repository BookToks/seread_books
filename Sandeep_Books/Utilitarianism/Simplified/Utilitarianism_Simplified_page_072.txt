You can only understand this by paying close attention to yourself and watching how others behave too. I think that if you look at these things fairly, you’ll see that wanting something and finding it enjoyable, or not wanting it and thinking it’s unpleasant, are really just two sides of the same thing. To put it simply, calling something desirable or calling it pleasant are just two ways of talking about the same feeling. Wanting something without seeing it as pleasant is basically impossible.

This seems very clear to me, so I don’t think many people will argue with it. Instead, they might say that wanting something (desire) is different from the will, or the choice to do something. They might say that a person with strong morals or clear goals acts on those goals without thinking about how happy it makes them, or what pleasure they might get from reaching them. This person keeps going even if the pleasure they get is less than before or if the pain from chasing their goals is bigger.
