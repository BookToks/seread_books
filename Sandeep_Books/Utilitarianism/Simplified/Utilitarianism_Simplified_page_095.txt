People naturally get upset whenever someone does something that bothers them. But when we think about what’s right and wrong with others in mind, we only get upset about things that harm everyone’s well-being. Fair people get angry if something hurts society, even if it doesn’t hurt them personally. And they don’t get angry just because something hurts them, unless it’s the kind of hurt that also hurts the community and should be stopped.

Some might say that when we feel treated unfairly, we only think about ourselves, not about society as a whole. It’s true that sometimes people get mad just because they’re hurting, which isn’t very good. But a person who feels anger for a good reason thinks about whether the action was actually wrong before getting upset. Even if they don’t say it out loud, they know they’re standing up for a rule that helps not just themselves but others too. 

If someone only thinks about how the action affects them and not about fairness, then they aren’t really thinking about what’s right. This idea is accepted even by people who don’t believe in judging actions by their results. For example, Kant said that you should act in a way that could be a rule for everyone to follow. This means that when deciding if something is right or wrong, you have to think about what’s best for all people, not just yourself.
