Happiness means feeling pleasure and not feeling pain. Unhappiness means feeling pain and not having pleasure. To really understand the moral ideas behind this, we need to explain more, especially what counts as pain and pleasure, and how much is still unclear.

But these extra details don’t change the main idea about life that this moral theory is based on—pleasure and not feeling pain are the only things worth wanting. Everything else people want is either because it brings pleasure or helps avoid pain.

Many people, even some very kind and thoughtful ones, don’t like this idea. They think it’s wrong to say life’s only goal is pleasure. They call this idea low and unworthy, like something only animals would believe. A long time ago, followers of the philosopher Epicurus were insulted this way, and even today, people from Germany, France, and England sometimes say rude things about those who believe this.
