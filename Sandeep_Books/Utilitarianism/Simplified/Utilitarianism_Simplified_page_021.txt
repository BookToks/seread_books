I don't think people who go through this common change choose to enjoy the simpler pleasures instead of the better ones on purpose. I believe that before they focus only on the simpler pleasures, they have already lost the ability to enjoy the better ones.

The ability to feel deeper, nobler emotions is like a delicate plant. It can easily die, not just because of bad influences, but also because it isn’t cared for. For most young people, this ability fades quickly if their life and friends don’t help them keep it alive.

People lose their high goals and interests just like they lose their love for learning, because they don’t have time or chances to enjoy them. They turn to easier pleasures, not because they want to, but because those are the only ones they can find or still enjoy. It’s hard to say if anyone who can enjoy both kinds of pleasures would ever choose the lower ones on purpose, though many have tried and failed to enjoy both at the same time.

From what the best judges say, I don’t think there’s any argument against this. When deciding which of two pleasures is better, or which way of living feels better, the opinion of those who know both well, or at least most of them, should be the final answer.
