Other countries, especially the Greeks and Romans, knew that laws were made by people. They weren’t afraid to admit that these people could make bad laws. Sometimes, the laws allowed things that, if done by a person without the law, would be seen as unfair.

Because of this, the idea of unfairness didn’t apply to breaking all laws, only to breaking laws that should exist, including some that don’t exist but should. People also thought laws themselves could be unfair if they went against what laws should be.

This way, the idea of law and its rules was still a big part of what people thought was fair, even when the actual laws weren’t seen as the right way to decide what is fair.

It’s true that people think about fairness in many situations that aren’t controlled by laws, and they don’t want laws to control every little thing in private life. But everyone agrees that in everyday actions, a person can act fairly or unfairly.

Even here, the idea that breaking what should be a law is unfair still stays, just in a smaller way.
