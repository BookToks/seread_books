People who don’t have close friends or family to care about don’t get as much excitement out of life. As they get closer to death, life feels less important because everything they want for themselves will end. But people who leave behind loved ones, and especially those who care about helping others too, stay just as interested in life even when they’re about to die as they were when they were young and healthy.

After being selfish, the main reason life feels unsatisfying is not learning enough. A well-trained mind—I don’t mean a philosopher’s, but any mind that has learned a good amount and knows how to think—finds endless interest in everything around it. This includes nature, art, poetry, history, how people live, and what might happen in the future. It’s possible to stop caring about all this, even without knowing much, but that usually happens when someone never really cared about the deeper meaning and only wanted to satisfy their curiosity.

There’s no real reason why everyone born in a modern, civilized country can’t learn enough to enjoy and understand these things in life.
