Sometimes, the things we use to reach happiness become more important than happiness itself. What we once wanted just to help us be happy, we now want just for its own sake. But even when we want it for its own sake, we still think it’s part of being happy.

A person believes they would be happy just by having it, and sad if they don’t get it. Wanting this thing isn’t different from wanting happiness—it's like loving music or wanting to be healthy. These things are part of what happiness is made of.

Happiness isn’t just an idea; it’s a real, whole experience. These things are some parts of that experience.

The idea that happiness is the goal agrees with this. Life would be pretty boring and not very happy if nature didn’t give us things that start off as neutral but end up making us feel good. These things can bring more lasting, stronger pleasure than the simple, basic pleasures we first want.
