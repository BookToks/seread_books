I totally agree with this and have said it clearly before. Will, which means the act of choosing or deciding, is different from desire, which is just wanting something. Even though will starts from desire, it can grow and separate from it. Sometimes, instead of wanting something because we choose it, we actually want it just because we have decided to.

This is an example of how powerful habits are, and it doesn’t only happen with good actions.

People keep doing many things they once did for a reason, just because it has become a habit.

Sometimes we do things without thinking about them first, and only realize after we’ve done them. Other times, we choose to do them, but that choice has become a habit, and we do it even if we don’t really want to, like people who keep bad habits or harmful pleasures. The last case is when the habit matches the person’s true goal or good intentions, like someone who is very virtuous and always works toward a clear goal.

So, the difference between will and desire is a real and important idea. It means that will, like everything else in us, can become a habit. And because of that, we might choose to do things we don’t really want anymore, or want things only because we have chosen to.
