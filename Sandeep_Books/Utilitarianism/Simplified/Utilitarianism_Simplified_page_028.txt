People don’t have to be selfish or only care about themselves. Many people already show something better than that, which proves that humans can be kind and caring.

Almost everyone who is raised well can truly love others and care about helping the world. There’s so much to enjoy, learn, and improve in life that anyone with some basic good values and intelligence can have a happy life.

If a person isn’t stopped by bad laws or bosses, they can use the things around them to be happy. They just need to avoid serious problems like poverty, sickness, or losing people they love too soon.

The biggest challenge is dealing with these hard problems. It’s rare to completely avoid them, and right now, we can’t always stop or even make them much better.
