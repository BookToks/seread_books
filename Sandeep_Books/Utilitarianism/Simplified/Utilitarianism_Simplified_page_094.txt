Secondly, humans have smarter brains, which help them feel a wider range of emotions, whether about themselves or others. Because of this higher intelligence, a person can understand that they are connected to their community. So, if something threatens the safety of their society, it also threatens them, and they feel a natural urge to protect themselves.

This smart thinking, combined with the ability to care about other people, helps them feel connected to their group, like their tribe, country, or all of humanity. When something harms these groups, it makes them feel sympathy and pushes them to stand up against the harm.

The feeling of justice, especially the part where we want to punish wrongdoers, comes from a natural desire for revenge. But this desire is shaped by our intelligence and care for society, applying only to the harms that affect us or our community. This feeling by itself isnâ€™t moral; what makes it moral is when we control it and only act because of our care for others and society.
