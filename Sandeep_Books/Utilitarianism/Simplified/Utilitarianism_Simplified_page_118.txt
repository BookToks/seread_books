Imagine a cruel ruler who saves his enemy from drowning, not to help him, but just so he can hurt him even worse later. Would it make sense to call saving that person "the right thing to do"? 

Or think about a man who breaks a promise to a friend because keeping it would seriously harm that friend or someone close to him. Would utilitarianism make us say that breaking the promise is just as bad as if he did it for a selfish reason?

I believe that someone who saves a person from drowning only to torture them later is doing something very different from someone who saves a person out of kindness or duty. The act itself is not the same. In this case, saving the person is just the first step in something much worse than letting them drown.

If Mr. Davis had said, "Whether saving someone from drowning is right or wrong depends a lot" — not on the motive, but — "on the intention," then no utilitarian would have disagreed with him. Mr. Davis made a common mistake by mixing up the ideas of motive and intention. 

Utilitarian thinkers, especially Bentham, have worked hard to explain this. The rightness or wrongness of an action depends completely on the intention — meaning what the person actually wants to do.
