This belief is the main reason why people who care about happiness want to do good. It helps a person who has strong feelings to want to help others, not just think about themselves. This comes from what I call external reasons—things outside of us that make us care.

It’s already been said that questions about ultimate goals can’t really be proven in the normal way.
