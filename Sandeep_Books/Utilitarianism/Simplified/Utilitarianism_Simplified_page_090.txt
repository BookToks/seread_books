So, the main difference that separates morality from other ideas like being useful or deserving something is still not justice itself. We need to find what makes justice different from other parts of morality.

Ethics experts split moral duties into two groups, but the words they use aren’t very clear. One group is called duties of perfect obligation, and the other is duties of imperfect obligation. Duties of imperfect obligation mean you have to do something, but you get to choose when and to whom. For example, charity is something you should do, but you don’t have to help a specific person or at a specific time.

In clearer legal terms, duties of perfect obligation are those where someone has a right that matches the duty. Duties of imperfect obligation are moral duties that don’t create any rights for anyone.
