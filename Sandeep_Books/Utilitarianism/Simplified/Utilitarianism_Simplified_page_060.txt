People naturally start to understand themselves as someone who cares about others. Caring for other people becomes something normal and important, just like taking care of our basic needs.

No matter how much someone feels this way, they are motivated by their own interests and kindness to show it and to help others feel the same. Even if a person doesn’t feel this care at all, they still want others to have it.

Because of this, even the smallest feelings of care grow stronger through the kindness of others and learning from those around us. Rules and social pressure also help support these feelings. As society grows, thinking about ourselves this way feels more natural.

Every time politics improve, it helps by removing conflicts and unfair advantages between people or groups. This means fewer people’s happiness can be ignored. As people’s minds get better, they feel more connected to everyone else. If this feeling was perfect, a person would only want good things that include everyone, not just themselves.
