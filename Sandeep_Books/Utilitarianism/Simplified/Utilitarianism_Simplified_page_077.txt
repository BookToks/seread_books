The feeling of justice might be a strange natural instinct, and like our other instincts, it might need to be controlled and understood by a smarter part of our mind. If we have instincts that help us think in certain ways, as well as instincts that make us act in certain ways, it doesn’t mean that the thinking instincts are always right any more than the acting instincts are always right. Sometimes both can lead us to make mistakes.

It’s one thing to believe we have natural feelings about what’s fair, and another to say those feelings are the final rule for how we should behave. But these two ideas are often mixed up. People tend to think that any strong feeling inside them must show some real truth about the world.

Right now, we want to find out if the feeling of justice is something special that needs to be explained in its own way. Is being just or unjust a unique quality, different from everything else about an action? Or is it just made up of other qualities put together in a certain way? To figure this out, it’s important to ask if the feeling of justice is something totally unique, like how we see colors and tastes, or if it’s made from mixing other feelings.
