He thinks to himself, I know I should not steal, kill, lie, or betray others. But why do I have to care about making everyone happy? If something else makes me happy, why can't I choose that instead?

If the idea from utilitarianism about how people understand right and wrong is true, this problem will always be there. It will stay until the ways we learn to be good make us care about others as much as we care about the results of our actions. This will happen when education helps us feel connected to other people, just like Jesus wanted. This feeling would become a natural part of who we are, just like how most kids learn to hate doing bad things.

For now, though, this problem doesn’t only apply to the idea of doing what’s useful. It happens with any attempt to explain what is right and wrong by simple rules. If the rules don’t already feel very important to people, they often lose some of their meaning.
