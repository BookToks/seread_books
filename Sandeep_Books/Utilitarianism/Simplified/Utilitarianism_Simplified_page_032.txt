Meanwhile, utilitarians always say that they have the right to believe in the goodness of putting others before yourself, just like the Stoics or Transcendentalists. Utilitarianism knows that people can give up their own happiness to help others. But it doesn’t think that the sacrifice itself is a good thing. If the sacrifice doesn’t make the total happiness bigger or help increase it, then utilitarians see it as wasted.

The only kind of giving up for others that utilitarians praise is when someone works to make others happy, or helps in some way that leads to happiness. This could mean helping all people together or just certain individuals, as long as it fits with what’s best for everyone.

I need to say again something that critics of utilitarianism often don’t admit: the happiness that matters in utilitarianism is not just the person’s own happiness, but the happiness of everyone involved. When choosing between their own happiness and others’, utilitarianism expects people to be completely fair, like a kind and neutral judge.
