Throughout history, people have changed their ideas about what is fair and right. Things that used to be seen as necessary, like having slaves or different social classes, are now seen as unfair and wrong. This has happened with groups based on freedom, wealth, or birth, and it is also happening with groups based on skin color, race, and gender.

Justice means following certain moral rules that are very important for a good society. These rules are usually more important than other duties. But sometimes, saving a life is so important that it can be okay to break a rule, like stealing food or medicine, or forcing a doctor to help someone.

In these cases, we don’t say justice is ignored. Instead, we say what is usually fair is not fair in this special situation. This way, we keep believing justice is always right, and we don’t have to say that unfair actions can be good.
