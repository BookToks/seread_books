It’s true that writers who support utilitarianism usually say mental pleasures are better than bodily pleasures because they last longer, are safer, and don’t cost much. They focus on these practical reasons rather than the pleasures themselves. On these points, utilitarians have made a strong argument. But they could also argue from a higher level and still be consistent. The idea of utility can include the fact that some pleasures are better and more valuable than others. It wouldn’t make sense to judge everything else by both quality and quantity but judge pleasures only by how much there is.

If someone asks me what I mean by different qualities in pleasures, or what makes one pleasure better than another besides how much there is, there is only one answer. Between two pleasures, if nearly everyone who has tried both clearly prefers one, without feeling they should prefer it for moral reasons, that pleasure is better. If people who really know both pleasures think one is much better, even if it comes with more problems, and they wouldn’t give it up for any amount of the other pleasure, then we can say the better pleasure is higher in quality. This means its quality is so much better that how much of the other pleasure there is doesn’t really matter.
