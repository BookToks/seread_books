This helps us understand what people say about whether it is possible or necessary to live without happiness.

It is definitely possible to live without happiness. Most people in the world do this without meaning to, even in places that aren’t very wild or uncivilized. Sometimes, heroes or martyrs choose to give up happiness on purpose because they care more about something else.

But what is that something else, if not the happiness of others or things that help make people happy? It is brave to give up your own happiness completely, but this sacrifice has a purpose. It isn’t done just for the sake of giving something up.

If someone says the purpose is not happiness but being good and virtuous, which is better than happiness, I ask this: would a hero or martyr make that sacrifice if they didn’t believe it would help others avoid having to give up their happiness too?

Would they do it if they thought giving up their happiness wouldn’t help anyone else, but only made others suffer the same loss?
