If one of these didn’t make him happy, and the other didn’t cause him any pain, he wouldn’t love or want to be virtuous, or he would only want it because of the other good things it might bring to himself or to people he cared about.

So, we now have an answer to the question about what kind of proof the idea of utility can have. If what I just said is true — if people only want things that are part of happiness or help make them happy — then we don’t need any other proof. This means that happiness is the only thing people really want.

If that’s true, then happiness is the main goal of everything people do, and we should judge all actions based on how much they promote happiness. This also means happiness should be the standard for what is right or wrong because it includes everything that matters.

Now, to figure out if this is really true — if people only want things because they bring pleasure or because not having them causes pain — we have to look at facts and experience. This is a question that depends on evidence, just like similar questions do.
