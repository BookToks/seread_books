One idea is that people should pay the government based on how much money they have. Others believe it’s fair to take a bigger percentage from people who have more money.  

Some think it would be fairer if everyone paid the same fixed amount, no matter how much money they have—like members of a club who all pay the same fee for the same benefits, even if some can’t afford it as easily.  

They argue that since the law and government protect everyone equally, it’s fair for everyone to pay the same price for that protection. It’s like a store selling the same item at the same price to all customers, not charging more just because someone can pay more.  

Not many people agree with this idea when it comes to taxes because it feels unfair and not realistic. But the idea of fairness behind it is still important and can’t be ignored.  

Because of this, people often try to say the government does more for rich people than poor people to justify taxing the rich more. But actually, if there were no laws, rich people would be much better at protecting themselves than poor people, and might even take advantage of the poor.
