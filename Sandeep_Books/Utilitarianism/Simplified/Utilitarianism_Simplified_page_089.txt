The truth is, the idea of punishment, which is a big part of what law is about, is involved not just in unfairness but in any kind of wrongdoing. We don’t call something wrong unless we think the person should be punished for doing it. If not by law, then by what others think; if not by others, then by their own feelings of guilt. This is the real difference between what is moral and what is just practical.

Duty means that a person can be forced to do what is right.

Duty is like a debt that someone must pay. If we didn’t think they could be forced to do it, we wouldn’t say it’s their duty. Sometimes it might not be smart or helpful to force them, but they still wouldn’t have the right to complain.

There are other things we want people to do, and we like or respect them if they do, or dislike them if they don’t. But we know they are not required to do these things. It’s not a moral rule, and we don’t blame or punish them for not doing them.

How we decide who deserves punishment will be explained later. But it’s clear that this difference is the base of what we call right and wrong. We say something is wrong if we think a person should be punished for it, or we use other words if we don’t. We say something is right if we think the person should be forced to do it, or just good if we want to encourage them to do it.
