What proof do we need for a belief to be trusted?

The only way to prove something can be seen is if people actually see it. The only way to prove a sound can be heard is if people hear it. This idea works the same for all our experiences.

Similarly, the only proof that something is worth wanting is that people do want it. If the goal of the utilitarian idea wasn’t accepted as a goal, no one could be convinced it really was.

There is no reason to say the general happiness is worth wanting, except that each person, as much as they think it’s possible, wants their own happiness. Since this is true, we have all the proof we can get that happiness is good.

Each person’s happiness is good for them, so the happiness of everyone together is good for all of us. Happiness has earned its place as a goal for how we act and as a way to decide what is right and wrong.

But this doesn’t mean happiness is the only way to decide what’s right or wrong.
