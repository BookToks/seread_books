Some people disagree with the idea that happiness is the main goal of life and actions. They say happiness can’t really be reached, and they ask, “Why do you even have the right to be happy?” Mr. Carlyle adds, “Not long ago, did you even have the right to exist?”

They also say that people can live without happiness. They believe that all great and noble people have understood this and became noble by learning to give things up. This lesson of giving up, they say, is the start and must-have part of being a good person.

If the first argument were true, it would change everything. If humans can never truly be happy, then happiness can’t be the goal of being moral or acting wisely. But even then, the idea of doing what’s useful still makes sense. That’s because being useful isn’t just about chasing happiness, but also about stopping or lessening sadness. If happiness is impossible, then it’s even more important to focus on reducing unhappiness, as long as people want to keep living and don’t choose to end their lives, like some have suggested under certain conditions.
