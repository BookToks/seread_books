No one who thinks carefully can doubt that most of the big problems in the world can actually be fixed. If people keep working to make things better, these problems will get much smaller over time.

Poverty, which means not having enough to live comfortably, can be completely solved if society is smart and people make good choices. Even disease, which is a really tough enemy, can be greatly reduced by learning about health, living well, and controlling harmful things around us. Science also promises to help us beat diseases even more in the future.

Every time we make progress, we lower the chances of dying early or losing people we love, which is even more important to us. As for bad luck or other problems related to money and life, most of these happen because people don’t make wise decisions, want too much, or because society’s rules are not good enough.

In short, the main causes of human suffering can mostly be beaten by people working hard and caring. Even though it takes a long time and many generations will suffer before things get much better, anyone who is smart and kind and tries to help will enjoy being part of this fight. They wouldn’t give up this chance for any selfish pleasure.
