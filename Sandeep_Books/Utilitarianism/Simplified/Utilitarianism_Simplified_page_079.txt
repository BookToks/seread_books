If we find the first option is true, then by solving this question, we will also solve the main problem. But if the second option is true, we will need to find another way to look into it.

To find what things have in common, we first need to look closely at the actual things themselves. So, let’s look at different actions and ways people behave that most people agree are either fair (just) or unfair (unjust).
