Even people who believe in sharing things equally still have lots of questions about what’s fair and how things should be done. Some Communists think it’s only fair to share everything exactly equally. Others believe that those who need more should get more. And some say that people who work harder or produce more should get a bigger share. All of these ideas can seem fair depending on how you look at it.

Because there are so many different ideas about what justice means, it’s hard to figure out what connects them all or what makes people feel that something is truly fair. Maybe understanding the history of the word “justice” can help with this.

In most languages, the word for “just” comes from ideas about laws or rules, especially old customs that acted like laws.
