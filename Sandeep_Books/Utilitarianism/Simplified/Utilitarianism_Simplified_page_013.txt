Sorry to anyone who disagrees with utilitarianism if it seemed like I mixed them up with someone who totally misunderstood it. This is surprising because people often say the opposite—that utilitarianism is all about pleasure, and in a very basic way.

An expert once pointed out that the same people often complain that utilitarianism is either too boring when they talk about "utility before pleasure," or too focused on pleasure when they say "pleasure before utility."

Anyone who really knows about this topic understands that every thinker, from Epicurus to Bentham, who supported utilitarianism, meant it as pleasure along with avoiding pain. They didn’t set usefulness apart from pleasure or fun things, but actually said usefulness includes those things and more.
