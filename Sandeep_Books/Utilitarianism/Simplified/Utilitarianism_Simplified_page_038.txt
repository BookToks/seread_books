This makes them unpopular with many people, but this unpopularity happens to everyone who takes the difference between right and wrong seriously. A careful utilitarian doesn’t need to worry about being disliked for this.

If the complaint is just that many utilitarians focus too much on whether actions are right or wrong by their own rules, and don’t pay enough attention to other qualities that make a person likable or admirable, then that can be true. Utilitarians who work on their sense of right and wrong but don’t develop their feelings for others or their appreciation for beauty can make this mistake. Other moral thinkers do the same if they are in the same situation.

What can be said to excuse other moral thinkers applies to utilitarians too: if there’s going to be a mistake, it’s better to make this kind of mistake. Actually, among utilitarians and others, there are all kinds of strictness and looseness in how they apply their rules. Some are very strict, while others are as easygoing as anyone who makes mistakes or cares deeply could want.
