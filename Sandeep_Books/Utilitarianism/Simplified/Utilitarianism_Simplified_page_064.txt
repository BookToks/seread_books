Not being able to prove something by reasoning is normal for all basic ideas. This goes for the first facts we know and for the first things we decide to do. But facts can be checked directly by our senses and what we feel inside.

Can we use the same senses and feelings to decide what goals are good? Or do we need another way to understand them?

Questions about goals are really about what things are worth wanting. The idea called utilitarianism says that happiness is the only thing worth wanting by itself. Everything else is only wanted because it helps us get happiness.
