But the reason someone wants to do something, the feeling that makes them want to do it, doesn’t change whether the action itself is right or wrong. However, it does change how we judge the person, especially if it shows they usually have good or bad habits that lead to helpful or harmful actions.

Professor Bain explains this idea well in a great chapter called "The Ethical Emotions, or the Moral Sense" in the second part of his detailed book about the mind.

Mr. Herbert Spencer, in his book Social Statics, thinks the idea that everyone should be treated equally in the utilitarian view shows that utility alone can’t fully guide what is right. He says the principle of utility assumes that everyone has an equal right to happiness. Actually, it means that equal amounts of happiness are equally good, no matter who feels it. This isn’t just an assumption but the main idea of utility—that happiness and what is wanted mean the same thing.
