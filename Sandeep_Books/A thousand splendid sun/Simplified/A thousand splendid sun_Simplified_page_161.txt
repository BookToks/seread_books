She realized she had dropped Aziza, and Aziza was screaming. She tried to breathe again but could only make a rough, choking sound. Drool hung from her mouth.

Then someone grabbed her by the hair. She saw Aziza being lifted, saw her sandals slip off, and her little feet kicking. Hair was pulled from Laila's scalp, and her eyes watered from the pain. She saw his foot kick open Mariam's room door and saw Aziza thrown onto the bed. He let go of Laila's hair, and she felt his shoe hit her left buttock. She cried out in pain as he slammed the door shut. A key rattled in the lock.

Aziza was still screaming. Laila lay curled up on the floor, gasping. She pushed herself up with her hands and crawled to where Aziza lay on the bed. She reached for her daughter.

Downstairs, the beating started. To Laila, the sounds were familiar and methodical. There was no shouting or begging, just the steady thump, thump of something hard hitting flesh, someone hitting a wall, clothes tearing.

Sometimes she heard running footsteps, a silent chase, furniture being knocked over, glass breaking, then the thumping again.

Laila took Aziza in her arms. Warmth spread down her dress as Aziza’s bladder let go.

Downstairs, the running and chasing finally stopped. There was a sound like a wooden club hitting meat again and again.

Laila rocked Aziza until the noises stopped. When she heard the screen door creak open and slam shut, she put Aziza down and looked out the window. She saw Rasheed holding Mariam by the back of her neck. Mariam was barefoot and bent over. There was blood on his hands, on Mariam’s face, hair, neck, and back. Her shirt was ripped open.

"I'm so sorry, Mariam," Laila whispered to the glass.

She watched Rasheed push Mariam into the toolshed. He went in, came out with a hammer and long wooden boards. He closed the shed doors, locked the padlock, tested the doors, and then went to get a ladder.

A few minutes later, Rasheed’s face appeared at Laila’s window. His hair was messy, and he had blood on his forehead. When Aziza saw him, she screamed and hid her face in Laila’s armpit.

Rasheed started nailing boards over the window.

The darkness was complete and thick, without any light or shapes. Rasheed had filled the gaps between the boards with something and put a heavy thing at the door’s bottom so no light came under it. Something was stuffed in the keyhole.

Laila couldn’t tell time by looking, so she used her hearing. Azan and roosters crowing meant morning. The sounds of plates and a radio meant evening.

The first day, they felt for each other in the dark. Laila couldn’t see Aziza when she cried or crawled.

“Aishee,” Aziza meowed softly.
