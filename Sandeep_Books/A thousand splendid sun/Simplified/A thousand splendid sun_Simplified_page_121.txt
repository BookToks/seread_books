It's a cold, cloudy day, but it's cozy next to Tariq under the blanket around them. She can see cars parked behind a low fence with chipped white paint under some palm trees blown by the wind. The wind makes her eyes water and covers their shoes in sand, throwing clumps of dry grass from one sand dune to another. They are watching sailboats moving up and down far away.

Seagulls are making loud noises and shaking in the wind around them. The wind blows more sand off the small hills. Then, there’s a sound like chanting, and she tells him something Babi taught her long ago about singing sand.

He rubs her eyebrow, brushing sand off. She notices the ring on his finger. It looks just like hers, gold with a maze pattern all around it.

She tells him the sound is real. It’s the rubbing of sand grains. “Listen.” He listens and frowns.

They wait and hear the sound again. It’s a groaning noise when the wind is soft, and a high-pitched, crying sound when it’s strong.

Babi said they should only take what they really needed. They would sell the rest.

“That should last us in Peshawar until I find work.” For two days, they collected things to sell. They made big piles.

In her room, Laila picked out old blouses, shoes, books, and toys. Under her bed, she found a small yellow glass cow Hasina gave her in fifth grade recess. A tiny soccer ball keychain from Giti. A little wooden zebra on wheels. A ceramic astronaut she and Tariq found once in a gutter. She was six, he was eight.

They had a small fight about who found it first.

Mammy collected her things too. She moved slowly and looked tired and distant. She got rid of her good plates, napkins, all her jewelry except her wedding ring, and most of her old clothes.

“Are you really selling this?” Laila asked, lifting Mammy’s wedding dress. It spread out on her lap. She touched the lace, ribbon, and tiny pearls on the sleeves.

Mammy shrugged and took it from her. She threw it roughly on a pile of clothes. Like ripping off a bandage quickly, Laila thought.

Babi had the hardest job.

Laila found him in his study, looking sad as he looked at his shelves. He wore a secondhand T-shirt with a picture of San Francisco’s red bridge. Thick fog was around the bridge towers.

“You know the old game,” he said. “You’re on a deserted island and can only have five books. Which do you pick? I never thought I’d have to do this.”

“We’ll start you a new collection, Babi.”

He smiled sadly. “I can’t believe I’m leaving Kabul. I went to school here, got my first job here, became a dad here. It’s weird to think I’ll be sleeping under different city skies soon.”

“It’s weird for me too.”

“All day, a poem about Kabul has been stuck in my head. Saib-e-Tabrizi wrote it in the seventeenth century, I think. I used to know the whole poem, but now I only remember two lines:

‘One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs,  
Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls.’”
