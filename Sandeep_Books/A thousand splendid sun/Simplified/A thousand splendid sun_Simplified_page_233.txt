Laila can’t bring herself to say it. It’s hard to feel happy. It feels fake and wrong.

That night, Zalmai wakes up coughing. Before Laila can do anything, Tariq swings his legs off the bed. He puts on his prosthetic leg and walks over to Zalmai, picking him up in his arms. From the bed, Laila watches Tariq moving back and forth in the dark.

She sees the shape of Zalmai’s head on Tariq’s shoulder, his hands holding Tariq’s neck, and his little feet bouncing near Tariq’s hip.

When Tariq comes back to bed, neither of them says a word. Laila reaches out and touches his face. Tariq’s cheeks are wet with tears.
