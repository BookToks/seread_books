It became a place where other Afghans who had escaped the war would meet. Late at night, after everyone left and the place was cleaned, the three of them would sit and drink tea at the empty tables. They were tired but grateful for their luck.

When Babi finished talking, he got quiet. They both did. They knew Mammy wasn’t going anywhere. Leaving Afghanistan was impossible for her while Ahmad and Noor were alive. Now that they were dead, leaving felt like a betrayal of what her sons had sacrificed.

How can you even think about leaving? Laila could hear her saying. Doesn’t their death mean anything to you, cousin? The only comfort I have is knowing I’m walking on the same land that soaked up their blood. No. Never.

Laila knew Babi would never leave without Mammy, even though she was no longer his wife or Laila’s mother. For Mammy, he would ignore his own dreams just like he brushed flour off his coat after work. So, they stayed. They stayed until the war ended. And they would stay for whatever came after.

Laila remembered Mammy once telling Babi that he had no strong beliefs. Mammy didn’t understand. If she looked in a mirror, she would see the one true belief in his life looking back at her.

Later, after eating boiled eggs and potatoes with bread, Tariq napped under a tree by a small stream. He used his coat as a pillow and had his hands crossed on his chest. The driver went to the village to buy almonds. Babi sat by a big acacia tree reading a paperback book. Laila knew the story; he had read it to her once. It was about an old fisherman named Santiago who caught a huge fish. But by the time he got back to shore, sharks had eaten all of it.

Laila sat at the edge of the stream, dipping her feet in the cool water. Mosquitoes buzzed above, and cottonwood seeds floated in the air. A dragonfly flew nearby, its wings shining in the sun as it moved from one blade of grass to another.

The wings flashed purple, green, and orange. Across the stream, some local Hazara boys were picking up dried cow dung and putting it into sacks they carried on their backs. A donkey brayed somewhere. A generator started making noise.

Laila thought again about Babi’s little dream. Somewhere near the sea. She hadn’t told Babi one thing up on the Buddha: she was actually glad they couldn’t go. She would miss Giti and her serious face, and Hasina with her loud laugh and silly jokes. But mostly, Laila remembered how hard those four weeks were without Tariq when he went to Ghazni.
