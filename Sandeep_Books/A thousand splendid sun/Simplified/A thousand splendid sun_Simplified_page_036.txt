When Mariam didn't answer, he asked again, this time more strongly. Mariam felt Jalil move beside her, and she noticed feet crossing and uncrossing under the table. Someone cleared their throat. A small, white hand reached out and brushed some dust off the table.

"Mariam," Jalil whispered.

"Yes," she said nervously.

A mirror was held under her veil. In it, Mariam saw her own face first—the plain eyebrows, flat hair, green eyes that looked serious, and her skin was rough and spotty. She thought her forehead was too wide, her chin too small, and her lips too thin. Her face looked long and a bit like a dog’s. But even though she wasn’t pretty, Mariam saw that her face wasn’t ugly either.

In the mirror, Mariam saw Rasheed’s face for the first time: big and square, with a hooked nose, red cheeks that looked like he was sneaky, watery and bloodshot eyes, and crooked teeth with the front two pushed together. His hair was thick, rough, and mixed black and white, with a very low hairline.

Their eyes met in the mirror for a moment, then looked away.

This is my husband, Mariam thought.

They swapped the thin gold rings Rasheed took from his coat pocket. His nails were yellow and curling, like a rotten apple. Mariam’s hands shook when she tried to put the ring on his finger, so Rasheed helped her. Her ring was tight, but Rasheed easily pushed it over her knuckles.

"There," he said.

"It’s a pretty ring," one of the wives said. "It’s lovely, Mariam." "Now, all that’s left is to sign the contract," the mullah said.

Mariam signed her name—the meem, the reh, the ya, and the meem again—feeling everyone’s eyes on her hand. The next time she signed a paper like this, it would be 27 years later, with a mullah there again.

"You are now husband and wife," the mullah said.
