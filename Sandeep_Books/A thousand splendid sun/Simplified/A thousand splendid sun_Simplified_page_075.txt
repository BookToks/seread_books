Sometimes Laila wondered why Mammy even decided to have her. She thought people shouldn’t have new kids if they had already given all their love to their old ones.

It didn’t seem fair. She got really angry. Laila went to her room and flopped down on her bed.

After she calmed down, she walked to Mammy’s door and knocked. When she was little, Laila used to sit outside this door for hours. She would tap and say Mammy’s name like a magic spell: Mammy, Mammy, Mammy… But Mammy never opened the door. She didn’t open it now either. Laila turned the knob and went inside.

Sometimes Mammy had good days. She would jump out of bed happy and playful. Her sad lips would turn into a smile. She took a bath, put on clean clothes, and wore makeup. She let Laila brush her hair, which Laila loved, and put earrings on her. They went shopping together at Mandaii Bazaar. Laila got Mammy to play snakes and ladders with her, and they ate pieces of dark chocolate, one of the few things they both liked.

Laila’s favorite part of Mammy’s good days was when Babi came home. Mammy and Laila would look up from their game and smile at him with brown teeth. A warm, happy feeling filled the room, and Laila caught a quick glimpse of the love and romance that had once held her parents together when their house was full of noise and joy.

On her good days, Mammy sometimes baked and invited women from the neighborhood over for tea and pastries. Laila got to lick the bowls clean while Mammy set the table with cups, napkins, and nice plates. Later, Laila would sit with the women at the living room table and try to join the conversation. Even though she didn’t have much to say, she liked listening because at these times Mammy spoke kindly about Babi.

“What a great teacher he was,” Mammy said. “His students loved him. Not just because he didn’t hit them like other teachers. They respected him because he respected them. He was wonderful.” Mammy loved to tell the story of how she asked Babi to marry her.

“I was sixteen and he was nineteen. Our families lived next door in Panjshir. Oh, I had such a crush on him, hamshiras! I used to climb the wall between our houses, and we’d play in his dad’s orchard. Hakim was always scared we’d get caught and my dad would hit him. ‘Your dad’s going to hit me,’ he’d say. He was so careful and serious even then. Then one day I said to him, ‘Cousin, what’s it going to be? Are you going to ask to marry me, or should I come ask you?’ I said it just like that. You should have seen his face!” Mammy would clap her hands as the women and Laila laughed.

Listening to Mammy’s stories, Laila knew there was a time when Mammy always spoke about Babi like this.
