A year has passed, and sometimes, in moments like this, Laila still can’t believe they found each other again. That he is really here with her, that he is her husband.

“Back? To Kabul?” he asks.

“Only if you want to,” she says. “Are you unhappy here? You seem happy. The kids too.” Laila sits up. Tariq moves on the bed and makes room for her.

“I am happy,” Laila says. “Of course I am. But… where do we go from here, Tariq? How long do we stay? This isn't home. Kabul is, and a lot is happening there, some of it good. I want to be part of it all. I want to do something. I want to help. Do you get it?” Tariq nods slowly. “This is what you want, then? You’re sure?” “I want it, yes, I’m sure. But it’s more than that. I feel like I have to go back. Staying here doesn’t feel right anymore.” Tariq looks at his hands, then back at her.

“But only if you want to go too.” Tariq smiles. The worries on his face fade, and for a moment he’s the old Tariq again, the Tariq who didn’t get headaches, who once said that in Siberia snot froze before it hit the ground. It might be her imagination, but Laila thinks she’s seeing this old Tariq more often these days.

“Me?” he says. “I’ll follow you to the end of the world, Laila.” She pulls him close and kisses him. She feels like she’s never loved him more than right now. “Thank you,” she says, resting her forehead against his.

“Let’s go home.” “But first, I want to go to Herat,” she says.

“Herat?” Laila explains.

The kids need some comfort, each in their own way. Laila has to sit down with Aziza, who’s still upset and having bad dreams. Aziza was scared to tears the week before when someone fired shots into the air at a wedding nearby.
