Over the years, Mariam often thought about what might have happened if she had let the driver take her back to the kolba. But she didn’t. She stayed outside Jalil’s house all night. She watched the sky get dark and the shadows cover the houses nearby. A girl with tattoos brought her some bread and a plate of rice, but Mariam said she didn’t want it. The girl left the food near her. Sometimes Mariam heard footsteps down the street, doors opening, and quiet greetings. Electric lights turned on, and windows glowed softly. Dogs barked. When Mariam got too hungry, she ate the rice and bread. Then she listened to crickets chirping in the gardens. Above, clouds moved across a pale moon.

In the morning, someone shook her awake. Mariam saw that during the night someone had covered her with a blanket.  

It was the driver shaking her shoulder.  

“This is enough. You’ve made a scene. Bas. It’s time to go.” Mariam sat up and rubbed her eyes. Her back and neck hurt.  

“I’m going to wait for him.”  

“Look at me,” he said. “Jalil Khan says I need to take you back now. Right now. Do you understand? Jalil Khan says so.” He opened the back door of the car. “Bia. Come on,” he said softly.

“I want to see him,” Mariam said, tears in her eyes.  

The driver sighed. “Let me take you home. Come on, dokhtarjo.” Mariam stood up and started walking toward him. But at the last moment, she changed direction and ran to the front gates. She felt the driver’s fingers try to grab her shoulder. She slipped away and ran through the open gates.

In the few seconds Mariam was in Jalil’s garden, she saw a shiny glass house with plants inside, grape vines on wooden frames, a fishpond made of gray stones, fruit trees, and bright flowers everywhere. Her eyes quickly moved over everything before they landed on a face in an upstairs window across the garden. The face was there just for a moment, long enough for Mariam to see the eyes get wide and the mouth open. Then the face disappeared. A hand pulled a cord, and the curtains closed.

Then strong hands grabbed her under her arms and lifted her off the ground. Mariam kicked. Pebbles fell from her pocket. She kept kicking and crying as they carried her to the car and put her on the cold leather backseat.

The driver spoke quietly and kindly as he drove.
