In the sky, a few gray clouds shaped like cauliflower floated by. Jalil had told her that gray clouds look dark because they are so thick that the top blocks the sunlight and casts a shadow on the bottom. "That’s the dark part you see under the clouds, Mariam jo," he had said.

Some time passed.

Mariam went back to the kolba. This time, she walked around the west side of the clearing so she wouldn't have to pass Nana. She looked at the clock. It was almost one o’clock.

He’s a businessman, Mariam thought. Something must have come up.

She went back to the stream and waited a little longer. Blackbirds flew above, diving into the grass somewhere. She watched a caterpillar slowly moving along the bottom of a young thistle plant.

She waited until her legs felt stiff. This time, she didn’t go back to the kolba. She rolled up her pants to her knees, crossed the stream, and for the first time in her life, walked down the hill toward Herat.

Nana was wrong about Herat too. No one pointed or laughed. Mariam walked along busy, crowded streets lined with tall cypress trees. People were walking, riding bikes, and riding mule carts. No one threw rocks at her. No one called her a harami. Almost no one even looked at her. She was, surprisingly, a normal person here.

For a while, Mariam stood by a round pool in the middle of a big park where stone paths crossed. She touched the beautiful marble horses that stood around the pool, their eyes looking down at the water. She watched a group of boys setting paper ships to sail on the water. Mariam saw flowers everywhere—tulips, lilies, petunias—all shining in the sunlight. People walked on the paths, sat on benches, and drank tea.

Mariam could hardly believe she was here. Her heart was beating fast with excitement.

She wished Mullah Faizullah could see her now. He would think she was so bold. So brave!

She let herself feel ready for the new life waiting for her in this city—a life with a father, with brothers and sisters, a life where she could love and be loved back, without holding back or feeling ashamed.

Feeling happy and lively, she walked back to the wide street near the park. She passed old sellers with wrinkled faces sitting under the shade of big trees, quietly watching her from behind piles of cherries and grapes.
