But Tariq just kept nodding.

"I'm sorry about your parents too," he said.

"You heard." "I talked to some neighbors earlier," he said. Laila wondered what else the neighbors had told him. "I don’t know anyone from the old days." "They're all gone. No one you’d know is left." "I don’t recognize Kabul." "Me neither," Laila said. "And I never left."

"Mommy has a new friend," Zalmai said after dinner that night, after Tariq had left. "A man." Rasheed looked up. "Does she, now?"

Tariq asked if he could smoke.

They stayed for a while at the Nasir Bagh refugee camp near Peshawar, Tariq said, tapping ash into a saucer. There were already sixty thousand Afghans living there when he and his parents arrived.

"It wasn’t as bad as some other camps like, God forbid, Jalozai," he said. "I guess at one point it was even a model camp during the Cold War, a place the West could show the world to prove they weren’t just sending weapons to Afghanistan." But that was during the Soviet war, Tariq said, the time of jihad, worldwide attention, lots of money, and visits from Margaret Thatcher.

"You know the rest, Laila. After the war, the Soviets fell apart, and the West lost interest.

There was nothing for them in Afghanistan anymore and the money stopped. Now Nasir Bagh is just tents, dust, and open sewers. When we got there, they gave us a stick and a piece of canvas and told us to build our own tent." Tariq said what he remembered most about Nasir Bagh, where they stayed for a year, was the color brown. "Brown tents. Brown people. Brown dogs. Brown porridge." 

There was a leafless tree he climbed every day, where he sat on a branch and watched the refugees lying in the sun, showing their sores and missing limbs.
