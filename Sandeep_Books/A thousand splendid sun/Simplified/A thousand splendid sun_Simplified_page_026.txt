They buried Nana in a quiet corner of the cemetery in Gul Daman. Mariam stood next to Bibi jo with the other women while Mullah Faizullah said prayers at the grave. The men gently lowered Nana's wrapped body into the ground.

After the burial, Jalil walked Mariam back to the kolba. In front of the villagers following them, he acted like he really cared for her. He picked up some of her things and packed them into a suitcase. Then he sat beside her bed where she lay down and fanned her face. He touched her forehead and, looking sad, asked if she needed anything. He even said "anything?" twice.

"I want Mullah Faizullah," Mariam said.

"Of course. He’s outside. I’ll get him for you." When Mullah Faizullah came into the kolba, Mariam cried for the first time that day.

“Oh, Mariam jo.” He sat next to her and held her face gently. “It’s okay to cry, Mariam jo. Don’t be ashamed. But remember what the Koran says: ‘Blessed is He who holds the kingdom and has power over all things, who created death and life to test you.’ The Koran tells the truth, my girl.

Behind every hard time and sadness God gives us, there’s a reason.” But Mariam couldn’t find comfort in God’s words that day. All she heard was Nana saying, “I’ll die if you go. I’ll just die.” All she could do was cry and let her tears fall on Mullah Faizullah’s old, thin hands.

On the way to his house, Jalil sat next to Mariam in the backseat of his car with his arm around her shoulder.

“You can stay with me, Mariam jo,” he said. “I already asked to have a room cleaned for you upstairs. I think you’ll like it. You’ll have a view of the garden.” For the first time, Mariam heard him like Nana would have. She could clearly hear the fake kindness behind his words, the empty promises. She couldn’t bring herself to look at him.

When the car stopped outside Jalil’s house, the driver opened the door and carried Mariam’s suitcase. Jalil held her shoulders with both hands and took her through the same gates where, just two days before, Mariam had slept on the sidewalk waiting for him. Two days ago, when all she wanted was to walk in this garden with Jalil, felt like a different life. How could everything in her life have changed so fast, Mariam wondered.
