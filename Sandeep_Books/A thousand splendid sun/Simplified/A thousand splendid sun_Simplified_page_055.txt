And why did she think she had the right, just a village girl from Aharam, to judge him?

Mariam tried the bottom drawer of the dresser.

There, she found a black and white picture of a boy named Yunus. He looked about four or five years old. He wore a striped shirt and a bow tie. He was a cute little boy with a thin nose, brown hair, and dark eyes that looked a bit tired. He seemed distracted, like something had caught his attention when the photo was taken.

Under that, Mariam found another black and white photo, a bit blurrier. It showed a seated woman and behind her, a younger, thinner Rasheed with black hair. The woman was pretty—not as pretty as the women in magazines, but still beautiful. Definitely more beautiful than Mariam. She had a delicate chin, long black hair parted in the middle, high cheekbones, and a soft forehead. Mariam thought about her own face, her thin lips and long chin, and felt a little jealous.

She stared at this photo for a long time. There was something weird about how Rasheed stood over the woman. His hands were on her shoulders. He had a tight, almost satisfied smile, but she didn’t smile and looked unhappy. Her body leaned forward slightly, like she was trying to get away from his hands.

Mariam put everything back where she found it.

Later, while doing laundry, she felt bad for snooping in his room.

What did she really learn about him? That he owned a gun and had the needs of a man? And she shouldn’t have looked so long at the photo of him and his wife. Her mind read too much into a random moment frozen in time.

Now, as the heavy clotheslines swung in front of her, Mariam felt sorry for Rasheed. He had a tough life, full of loss and hard times. She thought about his boy Yunus, who once made snowmen in this yard and ran up these stairs. The lake had taken him, swallowed him like a whale swallowed the prophet Yunus in the Koran. It hurt Mariam a lot to imagine Rasheed, scared and helpless, pacing by the lake and begging it to give his son back. For the first time, she felt close to her husband. She told herself they could be good partners after all.
