She didn’t fit in here.

But where do I fit? What should I do now?

“I’m all you have in this world, Mariam, and when I’m gone you’ll have nothing. You’ll have nothing. You are nothing!”

Like the wind blowing through the trees around the kolba, feelings of deep sadness kept passing through Mariam.

On Mariam’s second full day at Jalil’s house, a little girl came into the room.

“I have to get something,” she said.

Mariam sat up on the bed, crossed her legs, and pulled the blanket onto her lap.

The girl quickly walked across the room and opened the closet door. She took out a square gray box.

“You know what this is?” she asked. She opened the box. “It’s called a gramophone. Gramo. Phone. It plays records. You know, music. A gramophone.” 

“You’re Niloufar. You’re eight.” The little girl smiled. She had Jalil’s smile and dimpled chin. 

“How did you know?” Mariam shrugged. She didn’t tell the girl that she once named a pebble after her.

“Do you want to hear a song?” Mariam shrugged again.

Niloufar plugged in the gramophone. She took a small record from a pouch under the box’s lid. She put it on and lowered the needle. Music started to play.

“I will use a flower petal for paper, and write you the sweetest letter, you are the sultan of my heart, the sultan of my heart.”

“Do you know it?”

“No.”

“It’s from an Iranian movie. I saw it at my father’s cinema. Hey, do you want to see something?” Before Mariam could answer, Niloufar put her hands and forehead on the ground. She pushed with her feet and then stood upside down on her head, balancing on three points.

“Can you do that?” she asked thickly.

“No.”
