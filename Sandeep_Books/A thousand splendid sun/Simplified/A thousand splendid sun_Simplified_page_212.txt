Laila knew the face above her, all teeth and tobacco smell and scary eyes. She also felt Mariam nearby, her fists hitting down.

Above them was the ceiling, and Laila looked at it. Dark mold spots spread across it like ink on a dress. There was a crack in the plaster that looked like a smile or a frown, depending on where you stood. Laila remembered all the times she had tied a rag to a broom and cleaned the cobwebs from this ceiling. The three times she and Mariam had painted it white. Now the crack wasn’t a smile anymore but a mean sneer. The ceiling seemed to be shrinking, lifting, moving away from her into some dark, blurry space. It got smaller and smaller, like a tiny white stamp, and everything else went dark. In the dark, Rasheed’s face looked like a dark spot on the sun.

Laila saw quick flashes of bright light before her eyes, like silver stars exploding. Weird shapes appeared in the light—worms, egg shapes—moving and changing, mixing together, breaking apart, turning into other things, and then disappearing into blackness.

Voices sounded far away and muffled.

Behind her closed eyes, she saw her children’s faces flicker. Aziza, alert and serious, keeping secrets. Zalmai, looking up at his dad with hopeful eyes.

Laila thought, this is how it will end. Such a sad way. But then the darkness started to lift. She felt like she was rising up, being lifted. The ceiling slowly came back, got bigger, and she could see the crack again. It was the same old dull smile.

She was being shaken. “Are you okay? Answer me, are you okay?” Mariam’s worried face, scratched and heavy, was right above her.

Laila tried to breathe. It hurt her throat. She tried again. It hurt even more, in her throat and chest. Then she started coughing and wheezing.

Gasping, but still breathing. Her good ear was ringing.

The first thing she saw when she sat up was Rasheed. He was lying on his back, staring blankly with his mouth open like a fish. A little pink foam dripped from his mouth down his cheek. The front of his pants was wet. She looked at his forehead.

Then she saw the shovel.

A groan came out of her.
