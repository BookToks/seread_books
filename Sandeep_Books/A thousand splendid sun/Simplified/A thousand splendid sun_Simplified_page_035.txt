In the morning, Mariam was given a long-sleeved, dark green dress to wear over white cotton pants. Afsoon gave her a green hijab and matching sandals.

She was taken to the room with the long, brown table. Now, there was a bowl of sugar-coated almond candy in the middle of the table, a Koran, a green veil, and a mirror.

Two men Mariam had never seen before were sitting there. She guessed they were witnesses. A mullah she didn’t know was also at the table.

Jalil showed her a chair. He wore a light brown suit and a red tie. His hair was washed. When he pulled out the chair for her, he tried to smile kindly. Khadija and Afsoon sat on Mariam’s side of the table this time.

The mullah pointed to the veil, and Nargis put it on Mariam’s head before sitting down. Mariam looked at her hands.

“You can call him in now,” Jalil said to someone.

Mariam smelled him before she saw him. Cigarette smoke and strong, sweet cologne filled her nose, much stronger than Jalil’s. Through the veil, she saw a tall man with a big belly and broad shoulders, standing in the doorway. He was so big it almost made her gasp. Her heart pounded and she looked down. She felt him stay in the doorway for a moment, then heard his slow, heavy steps across the room. The candy bowl on the table made a clinking sound with each step.

With a deep grunt, he sat down beside her. He breathed loudly.

The mullah welcomed them. He said this would not be a normal nikka.

“I know Rasheed Agha has bus tickets to Kabul that leave soon. So, to save time, we will skip some traditional steps.” The mullah gave blessings and talked about marriage. He asked Jalil if he had any problems with this marriage, and Jalil shook his head. Then he asked Rasheed if he wanted to marry Mariam. Rasheed said, “Yes.” His rough voice sounded like dry leaves being crushed.

“And do you, Mariam jan, accept this man as your husband?” Mariam stayed silent. People cleared their throats.

“She does,” a woman’s voice said from down the table.

“Actually,” the mullah said, “she has to answer herself. And she must wait until I ask three times. Remember, he’s asking, not her.” He asked two more times.
