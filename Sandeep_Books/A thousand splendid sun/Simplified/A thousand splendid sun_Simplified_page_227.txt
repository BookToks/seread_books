In the middle of the night, when Laila woke up thirsty, she saw their hands still tightly holding each other, like kids gripping balloon strings nervously.

Laila likes Murree's cool, foggy mornings and its bright evenings, the dark, shining sky at night; the green pine trees and the soft brown squirrels running up and down the strong tree trunks. She likes the sudden rain showers that make shoppers in the Mall rush for cover. She likes the souvenir shops and the hotels where tourists stay, even though the locals complain about all the new buildings and roads that they say are ruining Murree’s natural beauty. Laila thinks it’s strange that people would be upset about new buildings. In Kabul, they would be happy about it.

She likes that they have a real bathroom, not an outdoor toilet, but a bathroom with a flushing toilet, a shower, and a sink with two taps. She can get hot or cold water just by turning the taps. She likes waking up to the sound of Alyona bleating in the morning and the grumpy but kind cook, Adiba, who makes amazing food.

Sometimes, when Laila watches Tariq sleep and her children mumble and move in their sleep, she feels a big wave of thankfulness that makes her eyes water.

In the mornings, Laila follows Tariq from room to room. Keys jingle on a ring clipped to his waist and a spray bottle of window cleaner hangs from his jeans.

Laila carries a bucket with rags, disinfectant, a toilet brush, and spray wax for the dressers. Aziza follows with a mop in one hand and the stuffed doll Mariam made for her in the other. Zalmai follows too, but he’s slow and moody, always a few steps behind.

Laila vacuums, makes the bed, and dusts. Tariq cleans the bathroom sink and tub, scrubs the toilet, and mops the floor. He puts clean towels, tiny shampoo bottles, and bars of almond-scented soap on the shelves. Aziza sprays and wipes the windows. Her doll is always close by.

Laila told Aziza about Tariq a few days after the nikka. It feels strange and a little weird, the way Aziza and Tariq act around each other. Aziza already finishes his sentences, and he finishes hers. She gives him things before he even asks.

They share secret smiles across the dinner table like they aren’t strangers but old friends who haven’t seen each other for a long time.

Aziza looked down at her hands when Laila told her.

“I like him,” she said quietly after a long pause.

“He loves you.”

“He said that?”
