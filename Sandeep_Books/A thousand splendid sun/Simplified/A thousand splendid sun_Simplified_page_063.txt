APRIL 1978

On April 17, 1978, the year Mariam turned nineteen, a man named Mir Akbar Khyber was found dead. Two days later, a big protest happened in Kabul.

Everyone in the neighborhood was outside talking about it. Mariam looked through the window and saw neighbors walking around, talking excitedly, with small radios held to their ears. She saw Fariba leaning against her house, talking to a woman new to Deh Mazang. Fariba was smiling and holding her pregnant belly. The other woman looked older and had purple-tinted hair. She was holding a little boy’s hand. Mariam knew the boy’s name was Tariq because she heard the woman call him that.

Mariam and Rasheed didn’t go outside. They listened to the radio as about ten thousand people marched through Kabul’s government area. Rasheed said Mir Akbar Khyber was a famous communist and that his supporters blamed the government for his murder. He didn’t look at Mariam when he said this. Lately, he never looked at her, so she wasn’t sure if he was really talking to her.

“What’s a communist?” she asked.

Rasheed snorted and raised his eyebrows. “You don’t know what a communist is? That’s easy. Everyone knows. It’s basic. I don’t know why I’m even surprised.” Then he put his feet on the table and mumbled that communists believe in Karl Marx.

“Who’s Karl Marx?” Mariam asked.

Rasheed sighed.

On the radio, a woman said that Taraki, the leader of the Khalq group of the Afghan communist party, was in the streets giving powerful speeches to the protestors.

“What I mean is, what do they want?” Mariam asked. “What do these communists believe?” Rasheed laughed and shook his head, but Mariam thought he looked unsure as he crossed his arms and looked away. “You know nothing, do you? You’re like a child. Your brain is empty. You don’t have any information.” 

“I’m asking because—”

“Be quiet.”
