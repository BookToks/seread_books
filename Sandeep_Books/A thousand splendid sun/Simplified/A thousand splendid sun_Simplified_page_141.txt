Like the burning feeling in her throat these days, a deep, paralyzing sadness would rise up in Laila’s chest. Her legs would feel like jelly. She would have to hold on to something.

Laila spent the winter of 1992 cleaning the house. She scrubbed the orange walls of the bedroom she shared with Rasheed and washed clothes outside in a big copper basin.

Sometimes she felt like she was watching herself from above. She saw herself squatting by the basin, sleeves rolled up, pink hands wringing soapy water from one of Rasheed’s undershirts. She felt lost, like a shipwreck survivor with no land in sight, only endless water.

When it was too cold to go outside, Laila wandered around the house. She walked, dragging her fingernail along the wall, down the hall and back, down the stairs and up again, her face unwashed and hair messy. She walked until she bumped into Mariam, who gave her a cold look and went back to cutting a bell pepper and trimming fat off the meat. A painful silence filled the room, and Laila could almost see Mariam’s silent anger like waves of heat rising from the ground. Laila would go back to her room, sit on the bed, and watch the snow fall.

One day, Rasheed took her to his shoe shop.

When they were outside, he walked beside her, holding her elbow tightly. For Laila, being out on the streets was hard. Her eyes were still getting used to the small view through her burqa, and her feet kept tripping over the hem. She was always scared she would fall or twist an ankle in a pothole. But she felt some comfort in the burqa hiding her. No one would recognize her.

She wouldn’t have to see the surprise, pity, or mean smiles when old friends noticed how far she had fallen and how her big dreams were ruined.

Rasheed’s shop was bigger and brighter than she expected. He made her sit behind his messy workbench, covered with old soles and scraps of leather. He showed her his hammers and how the sandpaper wheel worked, speaking proudly. He touched her belly, not over her shirt but under it, his fingers cold and rough like tree bark on her stretched skin. Laila thought of Tariq’s hands, soft but strong, with veins on the back she had always liked.

“Growing so fast,” Rasheed said. “It’s going to be a big boy. My son will be a champion like his father.” Laila pulled her shirt down, feeling scared when he said things like that.

“How are things with Mariam?” he asked. She said they were fine.

“Good. Good.” She didn’t tell him they had their first real fight.

It happened a few days before. Laila went to the kitchen and saw Mariam pulling drawers open and slamming them shut. Mariam was looking for the long wooden spoon she used to stir rice.

“Where did you put it?”
