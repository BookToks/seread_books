Maybe for the first and only time in her life, in the days before her wedding, Nana was truly happy.

As Nana told the story, Mariam sat on her lap and imagined her mother getting fitted for a wedding dress. She pictured her riding a horse, smiling shyly behind a green veil, her hands painted red with henna, her hair parted with silver dust, and her braids held together with tree sap. She saw musicians playing flutes and drums, and kids in the street shouting and running around.

But then, a week before the wedding, a jinn took over Nana’s body. Mariam didn’t need an explanation; she had seen it many times. Nana would suddenly collapse, her body going stiff, her eyes rolling back, her arms and legs shaking like something was choking her inside. Sometimes there was white foam or even blood at her mouth. Then she’d get sleepy, confused, and mumble nonsense.

When people in Shindand heard about it, the parakeet seller’s family canceled the wedding.

“They got scared,” Nana said.

The wedding dress was put away and after that, no one else wanted to marry Nana.

In a clearing, Jalil and his two sons, Farhad and Muhsin, built the small kolba where Mariam would live for the first fifteen years of her life. They made it from sun-dried bricks and covered it with mud and straw. Inside, there were two beds, a wooden table, two chairs, a window, and shelves where Nana put clay pots and her favorite Chinese tea set. Jalil installed a cast iron stove for winter and stacked firewood behind the house. He also made a tandoor outside for baking bread and built a chicken coop with a fence. He brought some sheep and built a feeding trough for them. Farhad and Muhsin dug a deep hole 100 yards away and Jalil built an outhouse over it.

Jalil could have paid workers to build the kolba, Nana said, but he didn’t.

“It was his way of punishing himself.”

Nana said that when she gave birth to Mariam, no one came to help. It was a damp, cloudy spring day in 1959, during King Zahir Shah’s long but mostly quiet rule. She said Jalil didn’t call a doctor or even a midwife, even though he knew the jinn might come back and cause her to have a fit while giving birth. She lay alone on the kolba’s floor, with a knife by her side, sweating all over.

“When the pain got really bad, I bit a pillow and screamed into it until my throat hurt. Still, no one came to wipe my face or give me water. And you, Mariam jo, you took your time coming into the world.”
