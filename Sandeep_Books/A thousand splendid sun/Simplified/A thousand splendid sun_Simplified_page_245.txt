But you didn’t want to see me. I was sad but I can’t blame you. If I were you, I might have done the same. I lost your trust a long time ago, and that’s my fault.

But if you’re reading this letter, then you also read the one I left at your door. You came to see Mullah Faizullah like I asked. I’m thankful you did, Mariam jo. I’m thankful I get to say a few words to you.

Where should I start?

Your dad has been through so much pain since we last talked, Mariam jo. Your stepmom Afsoon was killed on the first day of the 1979 uprising. Your sister Niloufar died the same day from a stray bullet. I can still picture her, my little Niloufar, doing headstands to show off to guests. Your brother Farhad joined the fight in 1980. The Soviets killed him in 1982 near Helmand. I never got to see his body. I don’t know if you have kids, Mariam jo, but if you do, I hope God watches over them and keeps you from the sadness I’ve had. I still dream about them. I still dream about my dead children.

I dream about you too, Mariam jo. I miss you. I miss your voice and your laughter. I miss reading to you and all the times we fished together. Do you remember those times? You were a good daughter, Mariam jo, and I feel shame and regret when I think of you. Regret… I have so much regret about you. I regret not seeing you the day you came to Herat. I regret not opening the door for you. I regret not treating you like my daughter and letting you live in that place for so many years. And for what? Being afraid of losing my reputation?

Worrying about my “good name”? Those things mean nothing now after all the loss and terrible things I’ve seen in this cursed war. But now it’s too late.

Maybe this is punishment for people who were heartless—to only understand when it’s impossible to fix anything. Now all I can say is you were a good daughter, Mariam jo, and I didn’t deserve you. All I can do now is ask you to forgive me. So please forgive me, Mariam jo. Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me.

I’m not the rich man you knew. The communists took most of my land and stores. But it’s silly to complain, because God has still given me more than most people. Since I came back from Kabul, I sold what little land I had left. I’ve included your part of the inheritance. It’s not a lot, but it’s something.

It’s something. (You’ll notice I changed the money into dollars. I think it’s best—only God knows what will happen to our own weak currency.) I hope you don’t think I’m trying to buy your forgiveness. I hope you believe that forgiveness can’t be bought. It never could be. I’m just giving you what was always yours. I wasn’t a good father to you while I was alive.

Maybe I can be in death.

Ah, death. I won’t give you the details, but it’s close now. The doctors say I have a weak heart. I think it’s a fitting way for a weak man to die.

Mariam jo, I dare to hope that after you read this, you’ll be kinder to me than I was to you.
