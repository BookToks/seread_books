Laila looked up and saw he was crying. She put her arm around his waist. "Oh, Babi. We’ll come back. When this war is over. We’ll come back to Kabul, inshallah. You’ll see."

On the third morning, Laila started moving piles of stuff to the yard by the front door. They planned to get a taxi later and take everything to a pawnshop.

Laila walked back and forth between the house and yard, carrying clothes, dishes, and boxes of Babi’s books. By noon, the pile by the door was as tall as her waist. She should have been tired, but with each trip, she felt closer to seeing Tariq again. Her legs felt stronger, and her arms didn’t get tired.

“We’re going to need a big taxi.” Laila looked up. It was Mammy calling from her bedroom window upstairs. She rested her elbows on the sill. The sun made her gray hair shine and showed her thin, tired face. Mammy wore the same blue dress from the lunch party months ago. It was a dress for a young woman, but now Mammy looked old. Her arms were thin, her temples sunken, and her eyes slow and heavy with dark circles. She looked very different from the happy woman in the wedding photos.

“Two big taxis,” Laila said.

She saw Babi in the living room stacking boxes of books.

“Come up when you’re done,” Mammy said. “We’ll have lunch. Boiled eggs and leftover beans.”

“My favorite,” Laila said.

She suddenly thought about her dream. She and Tariq on a quilt. The ocean. The wind. The dunes.

What did the singing sands sound like, she wondered.

Laila stopped and saw a gray lizard crawl out of a crack in the ground. Its head moved side to side. It blinked and ran under a rock.

Laila thought of the beach again. Now the singing was all around her. It was getting louder and higher. It filled her ears and blocked out everything else. The seagulls were like silent actors, opening and closing their beaks without sound. The waves crashed with foam but made no noise. The sands kept singing. Now they screamed. The sound was like… a tinkling?

No, not a tinkling. A whistling.

Laila dropped the books at her feet. She looked up at the sky and shielded her eyes with her hand.

Then a giant roar.

Behind her, a flash of white.

The ground shook beneath her feet.
