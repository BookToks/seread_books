Laila thinks the rest must have been torn up to use as firewood. The floor is now covered with dry leaves, broken bottles, old chewing gum wrappers, wild mushrooms, and yellowed cigarette butts. But mostly, there are weeds—some small, some growing halfway up the walls.

Fifteen years, Laila thinks. Fifteen years in this place.

Laila sits down, her back against the wall. She listens to the wind blowing through the willows.

There are more spider webs hanging from the ceiling. Someone spray painted something on a wall, but most of it has faded, and Laila can’t read it. Then she realizes the letters are in Russian. There’s an empty bird’s nest in one corner and a bat hanging upside down in another where the wall meets the low ceiling.

Laila closes her eyes and stays there for a while.

Back in Pakistan, it was sometimes hard to remember Mariam’s face. Sometimes, like a word you almost remember, her face slipped away. But here, it’s easy to see Mariam when Laila closes her eyes: her soft gaze, long chin, rough neck skin, and tight-lipped smile. Here, Laila can rest her cheek on Mariam’s lap again, feel Mariam rocking back and forth, saying verses from the Koran, and feel the words moving down Mariam’s body to her knees and into Laila’s ears.

Then suddenly, the weeds start to disappear, as if something is pulling them out from the ground. They sink lower and lower until the earth swallows their last leaves. The spider webs come down by themselves. The bird’s nest falls apart, twigs snapping loose and flying out. An invisible eraser wipes the Russian writing off the wall.

The floorboards come back. Laila now sees two sleeping cots, a wooden table, two chairs, a cast iron stove in the corner, shelves on the walls holding clay pots, pans, a blackened teakettle, cups, and spoons. She hears chickens clucking outside and a stream bubbling nearby.

A young Mariam sits at the table making a doll by the light of an oil lamp. She’s humming. Her face looks smooth and young, her hair clean and combed back. She has all her teeth.

Laila watches Mariam glue yarn onto the doll’s head. In a few years, this little girl will grow up to be a woman who asks for very little, who won’t bother others, and who won’t show that she’s had pain, disappointments, or dreams that got laughed at. A woman like a rock in a river, strong and steady, shaped by hard times but still graceful. Laila already sees something in this girl’s eyes, deep inside her, that neither Rasheed nor the Taliban can break. Something hard and strong like limestone. Something that will eventually cause both Mariam’s end and Laila’s hope.

The little girl looks up. Puts down the doll. Smiles.
