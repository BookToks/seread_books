You're so young! Mariam jan, right? My name is Fariba. I live on your street, five houses to your left, the one with the green door. This is my son Noor." The boy next to her had a smooth, happy face and thin hair like his mom. There was a patch of black hair on his left earlobe. His eyes looked playful and a little wild. He raised his hand. "Salaam, Khala Jan." "Noor is ten. I have an older boy too, Ahmad." "He's thirteen," Noor said.

"Thirteen going on forty." Fariba laughed. "My husband's name is Hakim," she said. "He's a teacher here in Deh Mazang. You should come by sometime, we'll have a cup." Then suddenly, other women pushed past Fariba and surrounded Mariam quickly. "So you're Rasheed jan's young bride." "How do you like Kabul?" "I've been to Herat. I have a cousin there." "Do you want a boy or a girl first?" "The minarets! Oh, what beauty! What a gorgeous city!" "Boy is better, Mariam jan, they carry the family name." "Bah! Boys get married and leave. Girls stay and take care of you when you're old." "We heard you were coming." "Have twins. One of each! Then everyone's happy."

Mariam stepped back. She was breathing fast. Her ears buzzed, her heart beat fast, and her eyes looked at every face around her. She stepped back again, but there was no way out. She was in the middle of the circle. She saw Fariba frowning and noticed she was upset.

"Let her be!" Fariba said. "Move aside, let her be! Youâ€™re scaring her!" Mariam held the dough close to her chest and pushed through the crowd.

"Where are you going, hamshira?" They asked. She pushed until she was free and then ran up the street. When she reached the intersection, she realized she ran the wrong way. She turned around and ran the other way, head down, tripping once and scraping her knee badly. Then she got up and ran fast, passing the women behind her.
