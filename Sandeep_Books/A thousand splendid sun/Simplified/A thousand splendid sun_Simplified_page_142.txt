She said, turning quickly to face Laila.

"Me?" Laila said. "I didn’t take it. I hardly come in here." "I’ve noticed." "Is that an accusation? That’s how you wanted it, remember? You said you would make the meals. But if you want to switch—" "So you’re saying it grew little legs and walked out? Teep, teep, teep, teep. Is that what happened, degeh?" "I’m saying…" Laila said, trying to stay calm. Usually, she could handle Mariam’s insults and finger pointing. But her ankles were swollen, her head hurt, and her heartburn was really bad that day. "I’m saying maybe you lost it." "Lost it?" Mariam opened a drawer. The spatulas and knives inside made noise. "How long have you been here, a few months? I’ve lived in this house for nineteen years, dokhiarjo. I have kept that spoon in this drawer since you were a baby." "Still," Laila said, almost breaking, teeth clenched, "it’s possible you put it somewhere and forgot." "And it’s possible you hid it somewhere to annoy me." "You’re a sad, miserable woman," Laila said.

Mariam flinched, then pulled herself together, pressed her lips tight. "And you’re a whore. A whore and a thief. A thieving whore, that’s what you are!" Then they shouted. Pots were raised but not thrown. They called each other names that now made Laila blush. They hadn’t spoken since. Laila was shocked at how easily she had lost control, but part of her liked it—liked how it felt to yell at Mariam, to curse her, to have someone to direct all her anger and sadness at.

Laila wondered, with a little understanding, if Mariam felt the same way.

Afterwards, she ran upstairs and threw herself on Rasheed’s bed. Downstairs, Mariam was still yelling, "Dirt on your head! Dirt on your head!" Laila lay on the bed, groaning into the pillow, suddenly missing her parents more than she had since the terrible days after the attack. She held tight to the bed sheet until suddenly, her breath stopped. She sat up fast, hands going to her belly.

The baby had just kicked for the first time.
