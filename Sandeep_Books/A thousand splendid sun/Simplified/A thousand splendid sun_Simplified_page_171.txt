Mariam SEPTEMBER 1997

"This hospital doesn’t treat women anymore," the guard said loudly. He was standing at the top of the stairs, looking down at the crowd in front of Malalai Hospital.

The crowd groaned loudly.

"But this is a women’s hospital!" a woman shouted behind Mariam. Others agreed and shouted too.

Mariam moved Aziza from one arm to the other. With her free arm, she helped Laila, who was moaning, and held onto Rasheed’s neck.

"Not anymore," the Talib said.

"My wife is having a baby!" a big man yelled. "Do you want her to give birth here on the street, brother?" Mariam remembered hearing that men and women would have to go to separate hospitals, and all female staff would be moved to one place. No one believed it before, and the Taliban hadn’t made it happen—until now.

"What about Ali Abaci Hospital?" someone asked.

The guard shook his head.

"Wazir Akbar Khan?"

"Men only," he said.

"What should we do then?"

"Go to Rabia Balkhi," the guard said.

A young woman stepped forward and said she had already been there. They had no clean water, no oxygen, no medicine, and no electricity. "There is nothing there."

"That’s where you go," the guard said.

More groans and shouts came from the crowd. Someone threw a rock.

The Talib raised his gun and fired shots into the air. Another Talib showed a whip.

The crowd quickly moved away.

The waiting room at Rabia Balkhi was full of women in burqas with their children.

The air smelled bad—sweat, dirty bodies, feet, urine, cigarette smoke, and medicine.

Under the slow-moving fan, children ran and jumped over the legs of fathers who were sleeping.

Mariam helped Laila sit against a wall where the paint was peeling.

Laila rocked back and forth, holding her belly.

"I’ll get you seen, Laila jo. I promise."

"Be quick," said Rasheed.

At the registration window, a crowd of women pushed and shoved each other.
