A few minutes before eleven, a man with a loudspeaker told everyone going to Peshawar to start getting on the bus. The bus doors opened with a loud hiss. People hurried and pushed to get on.

Wakil pointed to Laila as he picked up his son.

"We're going," Laila said.

Wakil went first. When they got close to the bus, Laila saw faces pressed against the windows. People were shouting goodbye all around them.

A young soldier was checking tickets at the door.

"Bov!" Aziza shouted.

Wakil gave the soldier their tickets. The soldier tore them in half and gave them back. Wakil let his wife go on the bus first. Laila saw Wakil and the soldier share a quick look. Wakil, sitting on the first step, whispered something to the soldier. The soldier nodded.

Laila felt her heart drop.

"You two, with the child, step aside," the soldier said.

Laila acted like she didn’t hear. She tried to get on, but the soldier grabbed her shoulder and pulled her out of line. "You too," he said to Mariam. "Hurry up! You're holding up the line."

"What’s the problem?" Laila asked, her voice weak. "We have tickets. Didn’t my cousin give them to you?" The soldier told another guard to be quiet. The second guard, a fat man with a scar on his cheek, nodded.

"Follow me," the guard said to Laila.

"We have to get on this bus," Laila said, her voice shaking. "We have tickets. Why are you doing this?"

"You're not getting on this bus. Accept it. You will come with me. Unless you want your little girl to see you dragged."

As they were taken to a truck, Laila looked back and saw Wakil’s boy at the back of the bus. He saw her and waved happily.

At the police station near Torabaz Khan Intersection, Laila and Mariam had to sit far apart in a busy hallway. Between them was a desk where a man smoked cigarettes and typed on a typewriter. Three hours passed like this. Aziza walked between Laila and Mariam, playing with a paper clip the man gave her. She finished her crackers and finally fell asleep in Mariam’s lap.

Around three o’clock, Laila was taken to an interview room. Mariam stayed in the hallway with Aziza.

The man in the interview room was about thirty years old. He wore regular clothes: a black suit, tie, and black shoes. He had a neat beard, short hair, and thick eyebrows that almost met.
