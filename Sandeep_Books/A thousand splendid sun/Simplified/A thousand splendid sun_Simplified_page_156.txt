Men wearing turbans were busy lifting bundles and crates onto the tops of buses, tying suitcases down with ropes. Inside the station, men stood in a long line at the ticket counter. Women wearing burqas stood in groups, talking, with their bags piled at their feet. Babies were being bounced, and children were scolded for wandering too far.

Mujahideen fighters walked around the station and the street, giving sharp orders. They wore boots, round hats called pakols, dusty green clothes, and all carried guns.

Laila felt like people were watching her. She didn’t look anyone in the eye, but she felt like everyone there knew what she and Mariam were doing and didn’t approve.

"Do you see anybody?" Laila asked.

Mariam shifted Aziza in her arms. "I’m looking." Laila knew this would be the first dangerous part—finding a man who could pretend to be part of their family. The freedoms women had from 1978 to 1992 were gone now. Laila remembered her father saying those years were good for women. But since the Mujahideen took over in 1992, Afghanistan became the Islamic State of Afghanistan. The Supreme Court was now full of strict religious leaders who got rid of laws that helped women and made new ones based on strict Islamic rules. Women had to cover up, couldn’t travel without a male relative, and adultery was punished harshly. Even if these laws weren’t always followed, they could be enforced more if the fighters weren’t so busy fighting each other—and hurting people like them.

The second dangerous part would be when they reached Pakistan.

Pakistan already had almost two million Afghan refugees and had closed its borders to Afghans in January. Laila heard that only people with visas could enter. But the border was always easy to cross, and thousands still got in by paying bribes or showing they needed help. There were also smugglers to help. "We’ll find a way when we get there," Laila told Mariam.

"How about him?" Mariam said, nodding.

"He doesn’t look trustworthy." "And him?" "Too old, and he’s with two other men." Finally, Laila found a man sitting on a park bench, with a woman wearing a veil next to him and a little boy about Aziza’s age bouncing on his knees. He was tall and thin, had a beard, wore an open shirt, and a simple gray coat missing some buttons.

"Wait here," Laila told Mariam. As she walked away, she heard Mariam quietly say a prayer.

When Laila went up to the young man, he looked up and shaded his eyes from the sun.

"Sorry to bother you, brother, but are you going to Peshawar?" 

"Yes," he said, squinting.
