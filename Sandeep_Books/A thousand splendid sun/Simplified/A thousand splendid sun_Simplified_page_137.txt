"I'm sorry." The girl gave Rasheed a cold, angry look, but Mariam saw it while Rasheed kept looking down and didn’t notice.

"No matter. The important thing is, I am your husband now, and it’s my job to protect not just your honor but ours—our nang and namoos. That’s what a husband has to do. You don’t need to worry about that. Please. You are the queen, the malika, and this house is your palace.

If you need anything done, just ask Mariam and she will do it for you. Right, Mariam?

If you want something, I will get it for you. That’s the kind of husband I am.

"All I ask is simple. Please don’t leave the house without me. If I’m not here and you really need something that can’t wait, you can send Mariam to get it for you. You probably noticed something different about us. Well, you don’t drive a Volga and a Benz the same way. That would be silly, right? Oh, and when we go out together, you have to wear a burqa. It’s for your own safety. There are so many bad men in this town now. They want to dishonor even married women. So that’s all.” He coughed.

“I want Mariam to be my eyes and ears when I’m not here.” He looked at Mariam sharply, like a hard kick to the head. “Not that I don’t trust you. Actually, you seem smarter than your age. But you’re still young, Laila jan, a young girl, and young girls sometimes make bad choices. They can get into trouble. So Mariam will be responsible.

And if there’s a mistake…” He kept talking. Mariam watched the girl out of the corner of her eye as Rasheed’s strict rules and criticisms fell on them like rockets on Kabul.

One day, Mariam was in the living room folding Rasheed’s shirts she had taken from the clothesline outside. She didn’t know how long the girl had been standing there, but when she picked up a shirt and turned around, she saw the girl by the doorway, holding a glass of tea.

“I didn’t mean to scare you,” the girl said. “I’m sorry.” Mariam just looked at her.

The sun shone on the girl’s face, on her big green eyes, smooth forehead, high cheeks, and thick eyebrows, which were very different from Mariam’s own thin, plain ones. Her yellow hair was messy and parted down the middle.

Mariam could tell the girl was nervous by how tightly she held the cup and how stiff her shoulders were. She imagined the girl sitting on the bed trying to get the courage to come in.

“The leaves are changing,” the girl said like she wanted to be friendly. “Have you seen? Autumn is my favorite. I like the smell when people burn leaves in their yards. My mother liked spring the best. You knew my mother?”

“Not really.” The girl cupped a hand behind her ear.

“I’m sorry?” Mariam said louder.

“I said no. I didn’t know your mother.”

“Oh.”
