The gun was red, and the trigger guard was bright green. Behind the gun, Khadim was grinning. Khadim was eleven, just like Tariq. He was big, tall, and had a serious underbite. His dad was a butcher in Deh Mazang, and sometimes Khadim threw pieces of calf intestine at people walking by. Sometimes, if Tariq wasn’t around, Khadim followed Laila at recess, staring at her and making weird noises.

One time, he tapped her on the shoulder and said, “You’re so pretty, Yellow Hair. I want to marry you.”

Now he waved the gun. “Don’t worry,” he said. “This won’t show. Not on your hair.” “Don’t you do it! I’m warning you.” “What are you gonna do?” he said. “Send your crippled brother after me? ‘Oh, Tariq jan, come save me from the badmash!’” Laila started to back away, but Khadim was already pulling the trigger. Thin jets of warm water hit Laila’s hair, then her hand when she raised it to block her face.

Then the other boys came out laughing and making fun of her.

Laila remembered an insult she’d heard on the street. She didn’t fully get it or how it worked, but the words felt powerful, so she yelled them.

“Your mother eats cock!” “At least she’s not crazy like yours,” Khadim shot back, calm. “At least my dad’s not a sissy! And hey, why don’t you smell your hands?” The other boys joined in. “Smell your hands! Smell your hands!” Laila smelled her hands, but she already knew what he meant. She screamed high-pitched. The boys laughed even more.

Laila turned and ran home, crying.

She got water from the well, filled a basin in the bathroom, and took off her clothes.

She soaped her hair, digging her fingers into her scalp, crying quietly because she felt gross.

She rinsed with a bowl and soaped her hair again, over and over. She felt like throwing up. She kept whining and shaking as she rubbed a soapy cloth on her face and neck until her skin got red.

This would never have happened if Tariq had been with her, she thought as she put on clean clothes. Khadim wouldn’t have dared do this. And it wouldn’t have happened if her mom had come like she was supposed to.
