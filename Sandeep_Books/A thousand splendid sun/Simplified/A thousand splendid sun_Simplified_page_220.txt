The most eager was Naghma, who was always hugging her elbows and following Mariam everywhere she went. Naghma liked to tell people bad news, whether it happened to her or someone else. She said her dad had promised her to a tailor who was about thirty years older than her.

"He smells bad, and has fewer teeth than fingers," Naghma said about the tailor.

She had tried to run away to Gardez with a young man she loved, the son of a local religious leader. They barely got out of Kabul. When they were caught and sent back, the young man was whipped before he said Naghma had tricked him with her charm. He said she had put a spell on him. He promised to focus on studying the Koran again. The young man was let go. Naghma was sentenced to five years in prison.

She said it was better that she was in prison. Her dad had promised that the day she was free, he would kill her.

Listening to Naghma, Mariam remembered the faint cold stars and the thin pink clouds over the Safid koh mountains that morning when Nana had told her, Like a compass needle that points north, a man’s blaming finger always finds a woman. Always. You remember that, Mariam.

Mariam’s trial happened the week before. There was no lawyer, no public hearing, no questioning of evidence, no chance to appeal. Mariam said no to having witnesses. The whole trial lasted less than fifteen minutes.

The middle judge, a thin looking Talib, was the leader. He was very skinny, with yellow, rough skin and a curly red beard. He wore glasses that made his eyes look bigger and showed how yellow the whites were. His neck seemed too thin to hold the turban on his head.

“You admit to this, sister?” he asked again, sounding tired.

“I do,” Mariam said.

The man nodded. Or maybe he didn’t. It was hard to tell because his hands and head shook a lot, like Mullah Faizullah’s tremor. When he drank tea, he didn’t reach for the cup. He motioned to the man beside him, who respectfully brought the cup to his lips. After, the Talib closed his eyes gently, a quiet and polite way to say thanks.

Mariam thought he was kind in a strange way. When he talked, he sounded a little tricky but also gentle. His smile was patient. He didn’t look at Mariam with hate. He didn’t speak to her with anger or blame but with a soft voice that sounded sorry.

“Do you fully understand what you’re saying?”
