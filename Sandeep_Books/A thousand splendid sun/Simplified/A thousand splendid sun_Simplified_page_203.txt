When Laila asked, he shook his head quickly and seemed annoyed. In that moment, Laila imagined rusty bars, dirty people, angry men, crowded rooms, and ceilings covered in mold. She could tell from his face that it had been a terrible place full of shame, pain, and hopelessness.

Tariq said his mom tried to visit him after he was arrested.

"She came three times, but I never got to see her," he said.

He wrote her letters, even though he wasn’t sure she got them.

"And I wrote you." "You did?" "Oh, lots," he said. "Your friend Rumi would be jealous of how many I wrote." Then he laughed loudly, like he was surprised by how brave he was and a little embarrassed by what he just said.

Zalmai started crying upstairs.

"Just like old times, then," Rasheed said. "You two. I guess you let him see your face." "She did," said Zalmai. Then, to Laila, "You did, Mammy. I saw you."

"Your son doesn’t like me much," Tariq said when Laila came back downstairs.

"I'm sorry," she said. "It’s not that. He just… don’t pay attention to him." Then she quickly changed the subject because it made her feel bad and weird to think like that about Zalmai, who was just a little boy who loved his dad. It made sense for him to not like a stranger.

And I wrote you.

Lots and lots.

"How long have you been in Murree?" "Less than a year," Tariq said. He made friends in prison with an older man named Salim, a Pakistani who used to play field hockey. Salim had been in and out of prison for years and was serving ten years for stabbing an undercover cop. Every prison has a guy like Salim, Tariq said.
