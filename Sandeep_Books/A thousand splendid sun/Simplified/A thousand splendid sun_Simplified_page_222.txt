But I can’t stop feeling upset about what you did, hamshira. It bothers me that his little boy was crying upstairs while it happened.

I am tired and sick, and I want to be kind. I want to forgive you. But if God tells me, “No, Mullah, you are not the one to forgive,” what should I say? His friends nodded and looked at him with respect.

Something tells me you’re not a bad woman, hamshira. But you did a bad thing. And you have to face the consequences. Shari’a law is clear about this. It says I must send you to the place where I will soon go too.

Do you understand, hamshira? Mariam looked at her hands and said yes.

May Allah forgive you. Before they took her away, Mariam was given a paper to sign under her statement and the mullah’s sentence. The three Taliban watched as Mariam wrote her name—meem, reh, yah, meem—remembering the last time she signed something, 27 years ago, at Jalil’s table, with another mullah watching.

Mariam spent ten days in prison. She sat by the window and watched life in the courtyard. When the summer wind blew, she saw scraps of paper twist and spin in the air, thrown around above the prison walls. The wind stirred up dust, spinning it wildly through the yard. Everyone—guards, prisoners, children, and Mariam—covered their faces with their elbows, but the dust got everywhere.

It filled their ears, noses, eyelashes, skin folds, even the gaps between their teeth. The wind stopped only at dusk. If a gentle night breeze came, it seemed sorry for the rough wind earlier.

On Mariam’s last day in Walayat, Naghma gave her a tangerine. She put it in Mariam’s hand and closed her fingers around it. Then she started crying.

“You’re the best friend I ever had,” she said.

Mariam spent the rest of the day by the barred window, watching the prisoners below.

Someone was cooking, and the smell of cumin floated through the window with warm air. Mariam saw children playing a blindfold game. Two little girls sang a rhyme that Mariam remembered from her childhood, when Jalil sang it while they fished by a stream:

Lili lili birdbath,  
Sitting on a dirt path,  
Minnow sat on the rim and drank,  
Slipped, and in the water she sank.

That last night, Mariam had strange, broken dreams.
