"Careful," Mariam said now, sitting with her knees over the edge. They lowered the TV into the hole, each holding one end of the plastic it was wrapped in. "That should work," Mariam said.

They patted the dirt down when they finished, filling the hole back up. They spread some dirt around so it wouldn't be obvious.

"There," Mariam said, wiping her hands on her dress.

They agreed that when it was safer, when the Taliban stopped their raids in a month or two or maybe longer, they would dig the TV up.

In Laila’s dream, she and Mariam are behind the toolshed digging again. But this time, they are lowering Aziza into the ground. Aziza’s breath fogs up the plastic sheet she is wrapped in. Laila sees her scared eyes and her pale hands pushing against the plastic. Aziza is begging. Laila can’t hear her screams. For a moment, she calls down, “It’s only for a little while. It’s the raids, don’t you know, my love? When the raids end, Mammy and Khala Mariam will dig you out. I promise, my love. Then we can play. We can play as much as you want.” She shovels the dirt. Laila woke up, out of breath, tasting dirt in her mouth, just as the first clumps hit the plastic.
