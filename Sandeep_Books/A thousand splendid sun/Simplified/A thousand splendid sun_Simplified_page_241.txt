The wind blows hard, making the tall grass hit Laila’s legs as she and Hamza climb the path and turn corners. On both sides, colorful wildflowers move in the wind. Some are tall with curved petals, others are low with fan-shaped leaves. Here and there, a few old buttercups peek through the bushes. Laila hears birds flying above and grasshoppers making noise on the ground.

They walk uphill for more than two hundred yards. Then the path becomes flat and opens into a wider area. They stop to catch their breath. Laila wipes sweat from her forehead and tries to get rid of some mosquitoes buzzing around her face. She sees low mountains far away, some cottonwood and poplar trees, and wild bushes she doesn’t know.

“There used to be a stream here,” Hamza says, breathing hard. “But it’s dry now.” He says he will wait here and tells her to cross the dry streambed and walk toward the mountains.

“I’ll wait here,” he says, sitting on a rock under a poplar tree. “You go on.” “I won’t.” “Don’t worry. Take your time. Go on, hamshireh.” Laila thanks him. She crosses the dry stream, stepping on stones. She notices broken soda bottles, rusty cans, and an old metal container half buried in the dirt.

She walks toward the mountains and sees the weeping willows with long branches shaking in the wind. Her heart beats fast.

She sees the willows are in a circle with an open space in the middle, just like Mariam said. Laila walks faster, almost running. She looks back and sees Hamza as a small figure with his colorful coat standing out against the brown trees. She trips on a stone but doesn’t fall. She hurries, pulling up her pants, and is out of breath by the time she reaches the willows.

Mariam’s kolba is still there.

When she gets close, she sees the window is empty and the door is missing. Mariam talked about a chicken coop, a tandoor, and a wooden outhouse, but Laila doesn’t see any of those. She stops at the kolba’s entrance and hears flies buzzing inside.

To get in, she has to move around a big spider web. It’s dark inside. Laila waits for her eyes to get used to the dark. When they do, she sees the inside is even smaller than she thought. Only half of one old, rotting floorboard is left.
