"That's the one thing you can't find on Chicken Street," Rasheed laughed. The street was full of shops and small stalls selling lambskin hats and colorful chapans. Rasheed stopped to look at a silver dagger in one shop, and in another, at an old rifle that the shopkeeper said was from the first war against the British.

"And I'm Moshe Dayan," Rasheed muttered. He half smiled, and Mariam felt like the smile was just for her—a secret, special smile.

They walked past carpet shops, craft shops, pastry shops, flower shops, and stores with men's suits and women's dresses. Behind lace curtains, Mariam saw young girls sewing buttons and ironing collars. Sometimes Rasheed greeted shopkeepers he knew, sometimes in Farsi, sometimes in Pashto. They shook hands and kissed on the cheek. Mariam stood a few feet away. Rasheed didn’t call her over or introduce her.

He asked her to wait outside an embroidery shop. "I know the owner," he said. "I'll just go in for a minute and say hello." Mariam waited outside on the busy sidewalk. She watched cars slowly moving up Chicken Street, dodging hawkers and people, honking at kids and donkeys that wouldn’t move. She saw bored merchants in their small stalls, smoking or spitting into brass spittoons, their faces coming out of the shadows to sell textiles and fur coats to people walking by.

But Mariam's eyes were mostly on the women.

The women here were different from the ones in the poorer neighborhoods where she and Rasheed lived. The women in their neighborhood covered up fully, but these women were what Rasheed had called "modern." Yes, modern Afghan women married to modern men who didn’t mind that their wives walked around with makeup and no head coverings. Mariam watched them walking freely down the street, sometimes with a man, sometimes alone, sometimes with rosy-cheeked kids wearing shiny shoes and leather strap watches. These kids walked bikes with tall handlebars and gold spokes, unlike the kids in Deh Mazang who had sand fly scars and rolled old bike tires with sticks.

These women swung handbags and their skirts made noise as they moved. Mariam even saw one smoking while driving a car. Their nails were long and painted pink or orange, and their lips were red like tulips. They wore high heels and walked fast, like they were always in a hurry.

They wore dark sunglasses, and when they passed by, Mariam caught a smell of their perfume. She imagined they all had university degrees, worked in office buildings, sat behind desks, typed, smoked, and made important phone calls to important people.
