A little barefoot boy brings them a tray with green tea and pistachio sweets. Hamza nods at him.

"My son." The boy leaves quietly.

"So tell me," Hamza says, feeling tired.

Laila starts to talk. She tells him everything. It takes longer than she thought. Near the end, she tries hard not to cry. It’s still hard, even after one year, to talk about Mariam.

When she finishes, Hamza stays quiet for a long time. He slowly turns his teacup on the saucer, first one way, then the other.

"My father, may he rest in peace, loved her very much," he says finally. "He was the one who said azan in her ear when she was born. He visited her every week and never missed a visit. Sometimes he took me with him. He was her teacher but also her friend. My father was a good man. It almost broke his heart when Jalil Khan gave her away."

"I'm sorry about your father. May God forgive him." Hamza nods to thank her. "He lived a long life. He even lived longer than Jalil Khan.

We buried him in the village cemetery, close to where Mariam’s mother is buried. My father was a kind man, surely in heaven." Laila puts down her cup.

"Can I ask you something?" "Of course." "Can you show me?" she says. "Where Mariam lived. Can you take me there?"

The driver agrees to wait a little longer.

Hamza and Laila leave the village and walk down the road that connects Gul Daman to Herat. After about fifteen minutes, he points to a narrow opening in the tall grass on the side of the road.

"That’s how you get there," he says. "There’s a path there."

The path is rough, twisty, and dark under the plants and bushes.
