They slowly moved over to the rocky ledge and stood side by side, with Babi in the middle, looking down at the valley below.

"Look at this!" said Laila.

Babi smiled.

The Bamiyan Valley below was full of green farming fields. Babi said they were winter wheat, alfalfa, and potatoes. The fields were lined with tall poplar trees and crossed by streams and irrigation ditches. Along the banks, tiny women were squatting and washing clothes. Babi pointed out rice paddies and barley fields on the hills. It was autumn, and Laila saw people wearing bright clothes on the roofs of mud brick houses, laying out the harvest to dry. The main road through the town was also lined with poplar trees. There were small shops, teahouses, and barbers along the street. Beyond the village, past the river and streams, Laila saw dry, dusty foothills, and beyond those, the snowy Hindu Kush mountains.

The sky above was clear and bright blue.

"It's so quiet," Laila said softly. She could see tiny sheep and horses but couldn’t hear any sounds.

"This is what I always remember about being up here," Babi said. "The silence. The peace. I wanted you to feel it. But I also wanted you to see your country’s history, to learn about its rich past. Some things I can teach you. Some you learn from books. But some things you just have to see and feel." 

"Look," said Tariq.

They watched a hawk flying in circles above the village.

"Did you ever bring Mammy up here?" Laila asked.

"Oh, many times. Before the boys were born. After too. Your mother was adventurous then, so full of life. She was the happiest, liveliest person I ever knew." He smiled, thinking about her. "She had this laugh. I swear that’s why I married her, Laila, because of that laugh. It was so strong, you couldn’t resist it." Laila felt warmth inside. From then on, she would always remember Babi like this: thinking about Mammy, his elbows on the rock, hands holding his chin, wind messing up his hair, eyes squinting in the sun.

"I'm going to check out some of those caves," Tariq said.

"Be careful," Babi said.
