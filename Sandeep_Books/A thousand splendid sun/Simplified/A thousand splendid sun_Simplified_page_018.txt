"I know what I want," Mariam said to Jalil.

It was spring 1974, and Mariam had just turned fifteen. The three of them were sitting outside the small house, under the shade of the willow trees, on folding chairs arranged in a triangle.

"For my birthday… I know what I want." "You do?" Jalil said, smiling.

Two weeks earlier, Mariam had asked Jalil about a movie playing at his cinema. He said it was a special kind of movie called a cartoon. It was made of lots of drawings that looked like they were moving when shown on a screen. Jalil told her the story was about an old toymaker who didn’t have any children. He made a puppet boy who magically came to life. Mariam asked for more, and Jalil said the puppet and the old man had many adventures, like visiting a place called Pleasure Island, meeting bad boys who turned into donkeys, and getting swallowed by a whale.

Mariam even told Mullah Faizullah all about the movie.

"I want you to take me to your cinema," Mariam said now. "I want to see the cartoon. I want to see the puppet boy." She noticed her parents’ mood change.

Mariam could see them looking at each other.

"That's not a good idea," said Nana. Her voice was calm and polite, but Mariam could feel her angry stare.

Jalil moved in his chair and cleared his throat.

"You know," he said, "the picture isn't very good. The sound is bad too. The projector has been broken lately. Maybe your mother is right. Maybe you should pick another present, Mariam jo." "See? Your father agrees," Nana said.

But later, by the stream, Mariam said, "Take me."

"I’ll send someone to pick you up and take you," Jalil said. "I’ll make sure you get a good seat and all the candy you want."

"No. I want you to take me."

"Mariam jo—"

"And I want you to invite my brothers and sisters too."
