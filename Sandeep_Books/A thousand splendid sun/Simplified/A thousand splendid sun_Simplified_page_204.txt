There was always someone clever and well-connected, who knew how to work the system and find you things. This person was surrounded by a mix of chances and risks. It was Salim who helped Tariq ask about his mother. Salim also told him gently that she had died because she was outside in the cold.

Tariq spent seven years in a prison in Pakistan. "I got off easy," he said. "I was lucky. The judge in my case had a brother who married an Afghan woman. Maybe that’s why he was kind to me. I don’t know." When Tariq finished his sentence in early winter 2000, Salim gave him his brother’s address and phone number. The brother’s name was Sayeed.

"He said Sayeed owned a small hotel in Murree," Tariq said. "It had twenty rooms and a lounge, a small place for tourists. He told me to say that he sent me." Tariq liked Murree as soon as he got off the bus: the pine trees full of snow, the cold fresh air, and the wooden cottages with smoke coming out of the chimneys.

Tariq thought, knocking on Sayeed’s door, that this was a place very different from the terrible things he had seen before. It was a place where even thinking about pain and sadness felt wrong and impossible.

"I told myself, here is a place where a man can get ahead." Tariq was hired as a janitor and handyman. He did well during the one-month trial period, earning half pay, that Sayeed gave him. As Tariq talked, Laila imagined Sayeed, with narrow eyes and a red face, watching Tariq chop wood and shovel snow. She saw him checking on Tariq as he fixed a pipe under the sink and watching the money in the register.

Tariq’s small house was next to the cook’s bungalow. The cook was an older widow named Adiba. Both houses were separate from the hotel, with almond trees, a park bench, and a stone fountain that made water sounds in the summer. Laila imagined Tariq sitting in his little house, looking outside at the trees.

After the trial period, Sayeed gave Tariq full pay, free lunches, a warm coat, and a new leg. Tariq said he cried because of how kind Sayeed was.

With his first full paycheck, Tariq went to town and bought Alyona.

"Her fur is pure white," Tariq said, smiling. "Some mornings, after it snows all night, all you can see of her outside is her eyes and nose." Laila nodded. There was a quiet moment. Upstairs, Zalmai started bouncing his ball against the wall again.
