I hope you can find it in your heart to come and see your dad. I hope you will knock on my door one more time and let me open it for you, to welcome you, to hold you in my arms, my daughter, like I should have done years ago. It's a hope as weak as my heart. I know that. But I will be waiting. I will listen for your knock. I will keep hoping.

May God give you a long and happy life, my daughter. May God bless you with many healthy and beautiful children. I hope you find the happiness, peace, and love that I couldn’t give you. Stay safe. I leave you in God’s caring hands.

Your father, who doesn’t deserve you, Jalil.
