"He's like a brother to me," she said, but she already knew she had made a mistake when Mammy’s face went dark.

"He's not," Mammy said coldly. "You can’t compare that one-legged carpenter’s boy to your brothers. No one is like your brothers." "I didn’t mean it like that," Laila said quickly. Mammy sighed and tightened her lips.

"Anyway," Mammy continued without her usual light tone, "if you're not careful, people will start talking." Laila wanted to say something. Mammy was right. The days when she and Tariq could play freely outside were gone.

Laila had noticed something strange when they were out together. She felt people staring, whispering—things she never felt before. She wouldn’t have cared if she hadn’t fallen for Tariq. She was totally in love with him. When he was near, she couldn’t stop thinking about him, imagining him close to her.

At night, she pictured him kissing her belly and wondered how his lips and hands would feel on her. Thinking about him made her feel guilty but also warm inside, like her face was glowing pink.

Mammy was right, more than she knew. Laila guessed many neighbors were already gossiping about her and Tariq. She’d seen the secret smiles and heard whispers that they were a couple. Just the other day, as they walked by Rasheed the shoemaker and his wife Mariam, Rasheed joked, “If it isn't Laili and Majnoon,” naming famous star-crossed lovers from an old Persian poem, kind of like Romeo and Juliet.

Mammy was right.

What annoyed Laila was that Mammy didn’t really have the right to say this. It would be different if Babi had said it. But Mammy? After all the years she ignored Laila’s life and didn’t care where she went or who she saw… It felt unfair. Laila felt like she was nothing more than a pot or pan—something to be ignored, then claimed when Mammy wanted.

But today was important for all of them. It would be childish to ruin it because of this. So, Laila let it go.

“I get your point,” she said.

“Good!”
