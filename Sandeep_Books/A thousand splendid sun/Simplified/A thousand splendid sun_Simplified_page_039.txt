It was early evening the next day when they got to Rasheed's house.

"We're in Deh Mazang," he said. They stood outside on the sidewalk. He held her suitcase in one hand and was unlocking the wooden front gate with the other. "It's in the south and west part of the city. The zoo and the university are close by." Mariam nodded. She already knew that even though she could understand him, she had to listen carefully when he talked. His Farsi had a Kabuli style mixed with a Pashto accent from his home in Kandahar. But he seemed to understand her Herati Farsi just fine.

Mariam looked around the narrow, dirt road where Rasheed’s house was. The houses were close together, sharing walls, with small yards in front separated from the street by walls. Most houses had flat roofs and were made of burnt brick or mud, the same dusty color as the mountains around the city. Gutters ran along the street, filled with dirty water. Mariam saw trash piled up here and there. Rasheed’s house had two floors and looked like it had once been painted blue.

When Rasheed opened the gate, Mariam stepped into a small, messy yard with patches of dry yellow grass. She saw an outhouse on the right and a well with a hand pump on the left. There were some dying small trees near the well and a toolshed with a bicycle leaning against it.

“Your father told me you like to fish,” Rasheed said as they walked across the yard to the house. Mariam noticed there was no backyard. “There are valleys north of here with rivers full of fish. Maybe I’ll take you someday.” He unlocked the front door and let her inside.

Rasheed’s house was much smaller than Jalil’s, but compared to Mariam and Nana’s small hut, it was huge. There was a hallway, a living room downstairs, and a kitchen. He showed her pots, pans, a pressure cooker, and a kerosene stove. The living room had a green leather couch with a big rip that was badly sewn up. The walls were empty. There was a table, two cane chairs, two folding chairs, and a black cast iron stove in the corner.

Mariam stood in the middle of the living room, looking around. At the hut, she could touch the ceiling with her fingertips. She could lie in her bed and tell the time by the sunlight coming through the window. She knew exactly how far her door would open before it creaked. She knew every crack in the wooden floorboards. Now, all those familiar things were gone. Nana was dead, and Mariam was here, in a strange city, far away from the life she knew by mountains and deserts. She was in someone else’s house, with different rooms and the smell of cigarette smoke, strange cupboards filled with unknown things, heavy dark green curtains, and a ceiling she couldn’t reach. The space felt too big and made Mariam feel trapped.
