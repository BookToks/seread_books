He looked at her from the side. "It worked." But she saw his frown soften a bit. She also thought the sunburn on his cheeks got a little redder for a moment.

Laila didn’t want to tell him. She actually thought it was a bad idea. Someone might get hurt because Tariq wouldn’t just let it go. But later, when they were walking to the bus stop, she saw Khadim again. He was leaning against a wall with his friends, thumbs hooked in his belt loops. He smiled at her like he was daring her.

So she told Tariq. The words came out before she could stop them.

"What did he do?" She told him again.

He pointed at Khadim. "Him? Are you sure?" "I’m sure." Tariq clenched his teeth and said something in Pashto that Laila didn’t understand. "Wait here," he said in Farsi.

"No, Tariq—" But he was already crossing the street.

Khadim saw him first. His smile disappeared, and he pushed off the wall. He took his thumbs out of his belt loops and stood up straighter, trying to look tough. His friends looked at Tariq too.

Laila wished she hadn’t told him. What if they all attacked him? How many were there—ten? Eleven? Twelve? What if they hurt Tariq?

Then Tariq stopped a few feet from Khadim and his group. Laila thought maybe he was going to change his mind and just tie his shoe and come back. But then his hands started moving, and she knew what was coming.

The others understood too when Tariq stood on one leg. He started hopping toward Khadim, then charged like he was attacking, his free leg swinging high like a sword.

The boys quickly moved out of the way. They let him get to Khadim.

Then it was all dust, punches, kicks, and yells.

Khadim never bothered Laila again.
