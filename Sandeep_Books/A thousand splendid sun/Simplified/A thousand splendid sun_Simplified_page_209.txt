Rasheed swung the belt again.

This time, Laila used her arm to protect herself and tried to grab the belt. She missed, and Rasheed hit her again with the belt. Laila caught it for a moment, but Rasheed pulled it away and hit her again. Then Laila started running around the room, and Mariam was yelling words that didn’t make much sense, begging Rasheed to stop as he chased Laila. He blocked her path and cracked the belt at her. At one point, Laila ducked and punched him on the ear, making him swear and chase her even harder. He caught her, slammed her against the wall, and hit her over and over with the belt. The belt buckle hit her chest, shoulder, arms, and fingers, making her bleed wherever it landed.

Mariam lost track of how many times the belt hit Laila, how many times she begged Rasheed to stop, and how many times she ran around the crazy fight of teeth, fists, and belt. Then she saw fingers digging into Rasheed’s face, scratching and pulling his hair. She was shocked but also happy to realize the fingers were hers.

He let go of Laila and turned to Mariam. At first, he looked at her without really seeing her. Then his eyes narrowed, looking at her with interest. His expression changed from confused to shocked, then to disapproval and disappointment, staying like that for a moment.

Mariam remembered the first time she saw his eyes under her wedding veil, in the mirror, with Jalil watching. Their eyes met through the glass—his cold and hers quiet, giving in, almost sorry.

Sorry.

Now she saw in those same eyes how foolish she had been.

Had she been a bad wife? She asked herself. A lazy wife? A bad woman? Dishonorable? Worthless? What had she done to deserve his hate, his constant attacks, and the way he enjoyed hurting her? Hadn’t she taken care of him when he was sick? Fed him and his friends? Cleaned up after him?

Hadn’t she given him her youth?

Had she ever deserved to be treated so badly?

The belt made a thump when Rasheed dropped it and moved toward her. That thump said some things are meant to be done with hands, not a belt.

But just as he came at her, Mariam saw Laila behind him pick something up from the floor. Laila raised her hand high, held it, and then swung it down hard against Rasheed’s face. Glass broke. Sharp pieces fell to the floor. Blood was on Laila’s hands and flowing from a cut on Rasheed’s cheek, down his neck, and on his shirt.
