The Soviet Union was nice to its workers, and everyone was treated equally. People there were happy and friendly. This was very different from America, where crime made people scared to go outside.

She said that people in Afghanistan would be happy too, once the backward bandits, called antiprogressives, were defeated.

"That’s why our Soviet friends came here in 1979—to help us. They wanted to stop these bad people who want our country to stay backward and poor. You kids must help too. You have to tell us if you hear about these rebels. It’s your job. Listen carefully and report, even if it’s your own family. Because no one loves you like your country does. Your country is most important! I’ll be proud of you, and so will your country." Behind Khala Rangmaal’s desk, there were maps of the Soviet Union and Afghanistan, and a photo of Najibullah, the communist president. Babi said Najibullah used to lead the secret police. There were other photos too, mostly of young Soviet soldiers smiling while helping villagers plant trees and build homes.

“Well,” Khala Rangmaal said, “have I stopped your daydreaming, Inqilabi Girl?” She called Laila that because Laila was born during the April 1978 revolution. But Khala Rangmaal hated the word "coup." She said what happened was an inqilab, a revolution where working people fought against unfairness. The word "jihad" was also forbidden. She said there wasn’t even a war, just small fights with troublemakers caused by foreign enemies. No one dared say that after eight years, the Soviets were losing. Especially now that President Reagan was sending Stinger Missiles to the Mujahideen, so they could shoot down Soviet helicopters. Muslims from many countries, like Egypt, Pakistan, and rich Saudis, were coming to fight the jihad.

“Bucharest. Havana,” Laila said quietly.

“Are those countries our friends?” Khala Rangmaal asked.

“Yes, moolim sahib. They are friends.” Khala Rangmaal nodded.

When school ended, Mammy didn’t come like she was supposed to. Laila had to walk home with two classmates, Giti and Hasina.

Giti was a small, tense girl with twin ponytails. She always frowned and held her books tight like a shield. Hasina was twelve, three years older than Laila and Giti, but she had failed third grade once and fourth grade twice.
