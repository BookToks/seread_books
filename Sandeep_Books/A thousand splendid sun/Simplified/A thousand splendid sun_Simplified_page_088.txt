"I need to talk to your parents, dokhiar jan," he said when Laila opened the door. He was a thick man with a rough, weathered face. He wore a brownish coat and a brown wool hat. "Can I tell them who’s here?" Then Babi put his hand on Laila’s shoulder and gently pulled her away from the door.

"Why don’t you go upstairs, Laila. Go on." As she walked toward the stairs, Laila heard the visitor tell Babi he had news from Panjshir. Mammy was in the room now too. She held one hand over her mouth, and her eyes kept moving between Babi and the man with the hat.

Laila peeked from the top of the stairs. She watched the stranger sit down with her parents.

He leaned in and whispered a few words. Then Babi’s face turned pale, even paler, and he stared at his hands. Mammy started screaming and pulling at her hair.

The next morning, the day of the faiiha, lots of neighborhood women came to the house and took over the plans for the khatm dinner after the funeral. Mammy sat on the couch all morning, nervously rubbing a handkerchief, her face swollen. Two women took turns softly holding her hand like she was very fragile. Mammy didn’t seem to notice them.

Laila knelt in front of her mother and held her hands. "Mammy." Mammy looked down and blinked.

"We’ll take care of her, Laila jan," one of the women said proudly.

Laila had been to funerals before and knew these women liked to control everything about death. They didn’t let anyone else help.

"It’s taken care of. You go do something else. Leave your mother alone," they told her. Feeling useless, Laila wandered from room to room. She fiddled in the kitchen. Hasina and her mother came, quiet and sad. So did Giti and her mother. When Giti saw Laila, she rushed over, hugged her tightly, and tears filled her eyes. "I’m so sorry, Laila," she said. Laila thanked her.

The three girls sat outside in the yard until a woman told them to wash glasses and stack plates.

Babi kept walking in and out of the house, looking like he didn’t know what to do.

"Keep him away from me."
