She had a tattoo under her lower lip.

"I'm here to see Jalil Khan. I'm Mariam, his daughter." The girl looked confused for a moment. Then she smiled a little and looked excited. "Wait here," she said fast.

She closed the door.

A few minutes later, a man opened the door. He was tall, with broad shoulders, sleepy eyes, and a calm face.

"I'm Jalil Khan's driver," he said kindly.

"His what?" "His driver. Jalil Khan is not here." "I see his car," Mariam said.

"He's away on important business." "When will he be back?" "He didn’t say." Mariam said she would wait. He closed the gates. Mariam sat down and pulled her knees to her chest. It was already early evening, and she was hungry. She ate the driver's toffee. After a while, the driver came out again.

"You need to go home now," he said. "It will be dark in less than an hour." "I'm used to the dark." "It will get cold too. Why don’t you let me drive you home? I’ll tell him you were here." Mariam just looked at him.

"I’ll take you to a hotel then. You can sleep there comfortably. We’ll see what we can do in the morning." "Let me into the house." "I’m told not to. Look, no one knows when he’s coming back. It could be days." Mariam crossed her arms.

The driver sighed and looked at her gently but seriously.
