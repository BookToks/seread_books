The driver stopped the taxi to let a long line of Soviet jeeps and armored vehicles go by. Tariq leaned over the front seat and shouted, "Please! Please!" A jeep honked, and Tariq whistled back, smiling and waving happily. "Nice guns!" he yelled. "Awesome jeeps! Awesome army! Too bad you're losing to peasants with slingshots!" The convoy went past, and the driver got back on the road.

"How much farther?" Laila asked. "About an hour," the driver said. "Unless we hit more convoys or checkpoints." Laila, Babi, and Tariq were on a day trip. Hasina wanted to come too and begged her dad, but he said no. The trip was Babi's idea. Even though he didn’t have much money, he hired a driver for the day. He wouldn’t tell Laila where they were going, only that it was part of her education.

They had been driving since five in the morning. Outside Laila’s window, the land changed from snowy mountains to deserts and rocky canyons. They passed mud houses with straw roofs and fields with piles of wheat. Sometimes, Laila saw black tents where Koochi nomads lived. They also saw burned Soviet tanks and broken helicopters. This, Laila thought, was the real Afghanistan where the war was happening—not in Kabul. Kabul was mostly peaceful. If it weren’t for some gunfire and Soviet soldiers smoking on the streets, the war might seem like just a story.

Late that morning, after passing two more checkpoints, they entered a valley.

Babi had Laila lean forward and pointed to some old red walls in the distance.

"That’s Shahr-e-Zohak, the Red City. It used to be a fortress, built about nine hundred years ago to protect the valley from invaders. Genghis Khan’s grandson attacked it in the 1200s but was killed. Then Genghis Khan himself destroyed it." 

"And that, my friends, is the story of our country—one invader after another," the driver said, flicking ash out the window. "Macedonians, Sassanians, Arabs, Mongols, and now the Soviets. But we’re like those walls—damaged and not pretty, but still standing. Right, Badar?"

"That’s true," said Babi.

Half an hour later, the driver pulled over.
