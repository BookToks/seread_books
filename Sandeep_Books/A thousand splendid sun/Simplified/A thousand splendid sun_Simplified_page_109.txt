"And it's not bad for you?"  
"I do it for the girls."  
"What girls?" He smirked. "They think it's sexy."  
"It's not."  
"No?"  
"I promise."  
"Not sexy?"  
"You look khila, like a half wit."  
"That hurts," he said. "What girls anyway?"  
"You're jealous."  
"I'm just a little curious."  
"You can't be both."  
He took another drag and squinted through the smoke. "I'll bet they're talking about us now."  

In Laila's mind, Mammy's voice was loud. Like a mynah bird in your hands. Let go, and it flies away. Guilt bit into her. Then Laila stopped Mammy's voice.  

Instead, she enjoyed how Tariq said "us." It sounded exciting and like a secret. It felt good to hear him say it so naturally. Us. It showed their connection clearly.  

"And what are they saying?"  
"That we're canoeing down the River of Sin," he said. "Eating a slice of Impiety Cake."  
"Riding the Rickshaw of Wickedness?" Laila added.  

"Making Sacrilege Qurma." They both laughed. Then Tariq said her hair was getting longer.  
"It's nice," he said. Laila hoped she wasnâ€™t blushing.  
"You changed the subject."  
"From what?"  
"The empty-headed girls who think you're sexy."
