A week went by, but Tariq still didn’t show up. Then another week passed.

To keep busy, Laila fixed the screen door that Babi hadn’t done yet. She took down Babi’s books, dusted them, and put them in order. She went to Chicken Street with Hasina, Giti, and Giti’s mom, Nila, who was a seamstress and sometimes worked with Mammy. During that week, Laila realized that waiting was the hardest thing to do.

Another week went by.

Laila started having really bad thoughts.

Maybe he would never come back. His parents had moved away for good; the trip to Ghazni was just a trick. It was a grown-up plan to save them from a sad goodbye.

Maybe a land mine hurt him again, like in 1981 when he was five, the last time his parents took him to Ghazni. That was just after Laila’s third birthday.

He was lucky then, losing only a leg; lucky to be alive at all.

Her head kept buzzing with these thoughts.

Then one night, Laila saw a tiny flashing light down the street. She made a small sound between a squeak and a gasp. She quickly grabbed her own flashlight from under the bed, but it didn’t work. She hit it with her hand and cursed the dead batteries. But it didn’t matter. He was back. Laila sat on her bed, so happy, watching that beautiful yellow light blink on and off.

The next day, on her way to Tariq’s house, Laila saw Khadim and his friends across the street. Khadim was squatting, drawing in the dirt with a stick. When he saw her, he dropped the stick and wiggled his fingers. He said something, and his friends laughed. Laila looked down and walked quickly past.

“What did you do?” she asked when Tariq opened the door. Then she remembered his uncle was a barber.

Tariq ran his hand over his freshly shaved head and smiled, showing his white, slightly uneven teeth.

“Like it?”

“You look like you’re joining the army.”

“Want to feel?” He lowered his head.

The tiny stubble scratched Laila’s palm in a nice way.
