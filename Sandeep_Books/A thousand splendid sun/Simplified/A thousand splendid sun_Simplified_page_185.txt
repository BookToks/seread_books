I think he’s lived here his whole life."  
"Yes, please ask him."  
"Call back tomorrow."  

Mariam said she couldn’t.  
"I only have this phone for five minutes. I don't—"  

There was a click, and Mariam thought he hung up. But she heard footsteps, voices, a car horn far away, and some humming with clicks, maybe from a fan. She moved the phone to her other ear and closed her eyes.  

She imagined Jalil smiling and reaching into his pocket.  

Ah, of course. Well, here it is then. Without any delay… A leaf-shaped pendant with tiny coins carved with moons and stars hanging from it.  

Try it on, Mariam.  

What do you think?  

I think you look like a queen.  

A few minutes passed. Then footsteps, a creaking noise, and a click.  
"He does know him."  
"He does?"  
"That’s what he says."  
"Where is he?" Mariam asked.  
"Does this man know where Jalil Khan is?"  

There was a pause.  
"He says he died years ago, back in 1987."  

Mariam’s stomach dropped. She had thought about this before. Jalil would be in his mid to late seventies now, but... 1987.  

He was dying then. He had driven all the way from Herat to say goodbye.  

She moved to the edge of the balcony. From here, she could see the hotel’s swimming pool, once famous, now empty and dirty, with bullet holes and broken tiles.  

And there was the old tennis court, the torn net hanging loose like dead snake skin.  

"I have to go now," the voice on the phone said.  
"I'm sorry to have bothered you," Mariam whispered, crying silently into the phone.
