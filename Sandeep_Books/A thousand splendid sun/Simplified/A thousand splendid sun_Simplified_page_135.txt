She imagined the tiny baby’s body being washed by strangers, wrapped in a brown cloth, and buried in a hole dug in a windy place while vultures watched sadly.

How could she run away now?

Laila thought sadly about the people in her life. Ahmad and Noor were dead. Hasina was gone.

Giti was dead. Mammy was dead. Babi was dead. Now Tariq was gone too… But somehow, a small part of her old life stayed with her, the last piece of who she was before she became so alone. A part of Tariq was still alive inside her, growing tiny arms and see-through hands.

How could she risk losing the only thing she had left of him and her past?

She made her decision fast. Six weeks had passed since she was with Tariq. If she waited longer, Rasheed would start to get suspicious.

She knew what she was doing wasn’t right. It was wrong, fake, and shameful. And it was really unfair to Mariam. But even though the baby inside her was barely bigger than a small berry, Laila already understood that being a mother meant making sacrifices. Being good was just the first one.

She put her hand on her belly and closed her eyes.

* * * Laila would only remember the quiet ceremony in small pieces. The cream-colored stripes on Rasheed’s suit. The strong smell of his hairspray. A small cut just above his Adam’s apple from shaving. His rough, tobacco-stained fingers when he put the ring on her. The pen. It didn’t work. Looking for a new pen. The contract. Signing it, his hands steady, hers shaking. The prayers. Seeing in the mirror that Rasheed had trimmed his eyebrows.

And somewhere in the room, Mariam was watching. The air was thick with her disapproval.

Laila couldn’t bring herself to look at the older woman.

* * * Lying under his cold sheets that night, she watched him pull the curtains closed. She was shaking before he started to unbutton her shirt and pull the string of her pants. He seemed nervous. His fingers kept fumbling with his own shirt and belt. Laila saw his sagging chest, his belly button with a small blue vein in the middle, the thick white hair on his chest, shoulders, and arms. She felt his eyes staring everywhere on her.

"God help me, I think I love you," he said. Through her shaking teeth, she asked him to turn off the lights.

Later, when she was sure he was asleep, Laila quietly reached under the mattress for the knife she had hidden there earlier. She used it to prick her finger.

Then she lifted the blanket and let her finger bleed on the sheets where they had lain together.
