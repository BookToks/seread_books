"He doesn't have to, Aziza."  
"Tell me the rest, Mammy. Tell me so I know." And Laila did.  

"Your father is a good man. He is the best man I've ever known."  
"What if he leaves?" Aziza said.  
"He will never leave. Look at me, Aziza. Your father will never hurt you, and he will never leave." The relief on Aziza's face made Laila feel really sad.

Tariq bought Zalmai a rocking horse and built him a wagon. While in prison, he learned how to make paper animals. So, he folded and cut lots of paper into lions, kangaroos, horses, and colorful birds for Zalmai. But Zalmai often ignored these gifts or even shouted at him.  

"You're a donkey!" he yells. "I don't want your toys!"  
"Zalmai!" Laila gasps.  
"It's okay," Tariq says. "Laila, it's okay. Let him."  
"You're not my Baba jan! My real Baba jan is on a trip, and when he comes back, he's going to beat you up! And you can't run away because he has two legs and you only have one!"  

At night, Laila holds Zalmai close and says Babaloo prayers with him.  

When he asks, she tells him the same lie again—his Baba jan went away, and she doesn’t know when he’ll come back. She hates having to lie to a child. Laila knows she’ll have to say this lie many times. Zalmai will ask again after playing, waking from naps, and later when he can tie his shoes or walk to school alone, she’ll lie again.  

Eventually, Laila knows, Zalmai will stop asking. Slowly, he will stop wondering why his father left. He won’t look for his father anymore at traffic lights, in old men walking slowly down the street, or in houses where people drink tea.
