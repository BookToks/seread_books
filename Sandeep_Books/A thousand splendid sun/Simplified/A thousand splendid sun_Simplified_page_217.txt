Sooner or later, they'll find us. They're like bloodhounds," Mariam said quietly, warning Laila. It made Laila’s promises seem silly and unrealistic.

"Mariam, please."  
"When they do, they'll blame you just like me. And Tariq too. I don’t want you all running away like criminals. What will happen to your children if you get caught?" Laila’s eyes filled with tears.

"Who will take care of them then? The Taliban? Think like a mother, Laila jo. Think like a mother. I am."  
"I can't."  
"You have to."  
"It’s not fair," Laila whispered.

"But it is. Come here. Lie down." Laila crawled over and rested her head on Mariam’s lap. She remembered all the times they spent together, braiding hair and sharing stories. Mariam always listened like it was something special.

"It is fair," Mariam said.  
"I’ve killed our husband. I took your son’s father away. It’s not right for me to run. I can’t. Even if they never catch us, I’ll never…," her lips shook, "I’ll never escape your son’s sadness. How do I look at him? How do I live with that, Laila jo?" Mariam played with a curl of Laila’s hair.

"For me, it ends here. I don’t want anything more. Everything I ever wished for as a little girl, you’ve already given me. You and your children have made me so happy. It’s okay, Laila jo. It’s okay. Don’t be sad." Laila couldn’t find an answer to Mariam’s words. But she kept talking anyway, like a child, about fruit trees to plant and chickens to raise. She talked about small houses and walks to lakes with fish. When she ran out of words, her tears kept falling, and all she could do was cry like a kid who can’t fight an adult’s strong truth. She curled up and hid her face in Mariam’s warm lap one last time.

Later that morning, Mariam packed a small lunch for Zalmai with bread and dried figs. She packed some figs and animal-shaped cookies for Aziza too. She put everything in a paper bag and gave it to Laila.

"Kiss Aziza for me," she said.
