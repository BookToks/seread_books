He looked at Laila, bouncing a pencil on the desk.

“We know,” he said, clearing his throat and covering his mouth with his fist, “that you already told one lie today, kamshira. The young man at the station wasn’t your cousin. He told us that himself. Now, the question is, will you tell more lies today?

I think you shouldn’t.”

“We were going to stay with my uncle,” Laila said. “That’s the truth.”

The policeman nodded. “The hamshira in the hallway, she’s your mother?”

“Yes.”

“She has a Herati accent. You don’t.”

“She grew up in Herat, but I was born here in Kabul.”

“Of course. And you are widowed? You said you were. My condolences. And this uncle, this kaka, where does he live?”

“In Peshawar.”

“Yes, you said that.” He licked the tip of his pencil and held it over a blank paper. “But where in Peshawar? Which neighborhood? Street name? Sector number?”

Laila tried to stop the panic rising in her chest. She gave him the name of the only street she knew in Peshawar, one she had heard once at a party Mammy had thrown when the Mujahideen first came to Kabul: “Jamrud Road.”

“Oh, yes. Same street as the Pearl Continental Hotel. He might have mentioned it.”

Laila took the chance and said he had. “That very same street, yes.”

“Except the hotel is on Khyber Road.” Laila heard Aziza crying in the hallway.

“My daughter’s scared. Can I get her, brother?”

“I prefer ‘Officer.’ You’ll be with her soon. Do you have a phone number for this uncle?”

“I do. I did. I…” Even with the burqa between them, Laila felt his sharp eyes on her. “I’m so upset, I think I forgot it.”

He sighed. He asked the uncle’s name, his wife’s name, how many children he had, their names, where he worked, how old he was. His questions made Laila nervous.

He put down his pencil, laced his fingers, and leaned forward like a parent talking to a small child. “You know, hamshira, it’s a crime for a woman to run away. We see it a lot. Women traveling alone, saying their husbands died. Sometimes they tell the truth, but most times they don’t. You can go to jail for running away. You understand, right?”

“Please let us go, Officer…” She read the name on his badge. “Officer Rahman. Please be kind. What’s the harm in letting two women go? We’re not criminals.”

“I can’t.”

“I beg you, please.”

“It’s the law, hamshira,” Rahman said, sounding serious and important. “It’s my job to keep order.”

Even though she was upset, Laila almost laughed. She was shocked he used the word “order” after all the killing, stealing, rapes, tortures, and bombings the Mujahideen had done. They didn’t care about the innocent people caught in the fighting.
