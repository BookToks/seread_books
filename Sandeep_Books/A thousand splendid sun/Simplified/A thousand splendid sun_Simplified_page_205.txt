 "I know. You told me." Laila's voice broke. She had to clear her throat, collect herself. "The man who came to give the news, he was so earnest…I believed him, Tariq. I wish I hadn't, but I did. And then I felt so alone and scared. Otherwise, I wouldn't have agreed to marry Rasheed. I wouldn't have…" "You don't have to do this," he said softly, avoiding her eyes.
