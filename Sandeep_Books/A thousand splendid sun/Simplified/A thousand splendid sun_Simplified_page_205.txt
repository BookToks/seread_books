"I thought you were dead," Laila said.

"I know. You told me." Laila's voice broke. She had to clear her throat and calm down. "The man who came to tell me was so serious…I believed him, Tariq. I wish I hadn't, but I did. Then I felt so alone and scared. If I hadn't, I wouldn't have agreed to marry Rasheed. I wouldn't have…" 

"You don’t have to do this," he said softly, not looking at her. He wasn’t blaming her or angry.

"But I do. There was a bigger reason why I married him. Something you don’t know, Tariq. Someone. I have to tell you."

"Did you sit and talk with him too?" Rasheed asked Zalmai.

Zalmai didn’t say anything. Laila saw he looked unsure and nervous, like he realized what he said was more serious than he thought.

"I asked you a question, boy." Zalmai swallowed hard and kept looking around. "I was upstairs, playing with Mariam."

"And your mother?" Zalmai looked at Laila sadly, almost crying.

"It’s okay, Zalmai," Laila said. "Tell the truth."

"She was… she was downstairs, talking to that man," he said quietly, barely louder than a whisper.

"I see," said Rasheed. "Teamwork."

As he was leaving, Tariq said, "I want to meet her. I want to see her."

"I’ll arrange it," Laila said.

"Aziza. Aziza." He smiled, saying the name slowly. When Rasheed said their daughter’s name, it always sounded weird and almost rude to Laila.

"Aziza. It’s a beautiful name."

"So is she."
