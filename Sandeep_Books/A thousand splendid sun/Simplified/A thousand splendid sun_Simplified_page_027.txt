She kept looking at the ground, watching her feet step on the gray stone path. She knew people were in the garden, whispering and moving aside as she and Jalil walked by. She felt eyes watching her from the windows upstairs.

Inside the house, Mariam kept her head down too. She walked on a maroon carpet with a blue and yellow pattern. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw marble statues, the bottom parts of vases, and the worn ends of colorful tapestries hanging on the walls. The stairs they took were wide and covered with a similar carpet, held down at each step. At the top, Jalil turned left down a long carpeted hallway. He stopped at a door, opened it, and let her in.

“Your sisters Niloufar and Atieh sometimes play here,” Jalil said, “but mostly we use this as a guest room. You’ll be comfortable here, I think. It’s nice, right?” The room had a bed with a green blanket covered in flower patterns. The curtains matched the blanket and were pulled back to show the garden outside. Next to the bed was a small chest with three drawers and a flower vase on top. Shelves lined the walls, holding framed pictures of people Mariam didn’t know. On one shelf, there was a row of identical wooden dolls, arranged from biggest to smallest.

Jalil saw her looking. “Those are Matryoshka dolls. I got them in Moscow. You can play with them if you want. No one will mind.” Mariam sat on the bed.

“Is there anything you want?” Jalil asked.

Mariam lay down and closed her eyes. After a while, she heard him quietly close the door.

Except for when she had to use the bathroom down the hall, Mariam stayed in the room.

The girl with the tattoo, who had opened the gates for her, brought her meals on a tray: lamb kebab, sabzi, aush soup. Most of it she didn’t eat. Jalil came by several times a day, sat on the bed next to her, and asked if she was okay.

“You could eat downstairs with the rest of us,” he said, but didn’t really mean it. He seemed to understand quickly when Mariam said she preferred to eat alone.

From the window, Mariam watched quietly what she had always wondered about and wanted to see: Jalil’s daily life. Servants hurried in and out of the front gates. A gardener trimmed bushes and watered plants in the greenhouse. Cars with long, shiny hoods pulled up on the street. Men in suits, wearing chapcms and caracul hats, got out. Women in hijabs and children with neat hair came too.

And as Mariam watched Jalil shake hands with these strangers, cross his palms on his chest, and nod to their wives, she knew that Nana had told the truth.
