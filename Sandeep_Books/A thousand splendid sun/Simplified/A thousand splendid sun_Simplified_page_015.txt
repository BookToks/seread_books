Mariam loved having visitors at the kolba. The village arbab and his gifts, Bibi jo with her sore hip and endless gossip, and of course, Mullah Faizullah. But no one, absolutely no one, did Mariam want to see more than Jalil.

On Tuesday nights, Mariam would start feeling worried. She barely slept, afraid that something would stop Jalil from coming on Thursday, and she’d have to wait another whole week to see him. On Wednesdays, she walked around outside, throwing chicken feed into the coop without really thinking. She took random walks, picked flower petals, and tried to shoo away mosquitoes biting her arms. Then, on Thursdays, all she could do was sit by a wall, staring at the stream, waiting. If Jalil was late, a terrible fear slowly filled her. Her knees would get weak, and she’d have to lie down somewhere.

Then Nana would say, “And there he is, your father. In all his glory.” Mariam would jump up the moment she saw him hopping across the stream on stones, smiling and waving. She knew Nana was watching her carefully, trying to see how she’d react. It took a lot of effort for Mariam to stay in the doorway, to wait and watch him walk slowly toward her, and not run to him right away. She held back, watching him walk through the tall grass, his suit jacket over his shoulder, the breeze lifting his red necktie.

When Jalil reached the clearing, he’d throw his jacket on the tandoor and open his arms. Mariam would walk, then finally run to him, and he would catch her under the arms and toss her up high. Mariam would laugh loudly.

As she hung in the air, Mariam looked down at Jalil’s face, smiling up at her. She saw his crooked smile, his widow’s peak hairline, and his chin with a little cleft where her pinkie could rest. His teeth were the whitest in a town full of bad teeth. She liked his trimmed mustache and how he always wore a suit on his visits—dark brown, his favorite color—with a white handkerchief in his pocket, shiny cuff links, and a red tie he left loose. Mariam could see herself in the brown of his eyes: her hair flying, her face full of excitement, and the sky behind her.

Nana said one day he would miss catching her, and she’d fall and break a bone. But Mariam didn’t believe Jalil would ever drop her. She believed she would always land safely in her dad’s clean, well-kept hands.

They sat outside the kolba in the shade while Nana served tea. Jalil and Nana gave each other nervous smiles and nodded. Jalil never mentioned Nana’s rock throwing or her cursing.

Even though Nana complained about him when he wasn’t there, she was quiet and polite when Jalil visited. Her hair was always clean, she brushed her teeth, and wore her best hijab for him. She sat quietly on a chair across from him, hands folded in her lap. She never looked at him directly or used bad words around him.
