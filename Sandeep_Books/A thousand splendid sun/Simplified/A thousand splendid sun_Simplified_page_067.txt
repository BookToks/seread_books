He whimpered, copying her. "What's wrong? You messed up again."  
"But I boiled it five minutes longer than usual."  
"That's a big lie."  
"I swear."  

He angrily shook the rice from his fingers and pushed the plate away, spilling sauce and rice on the floor cloth. Mariam watched as he stormed out of the living room and then out of the house, slamming the door behind him.  

Mariam knelt down and tried to pick up the grains of rice to put them back on the plate, but her hands were shaking badly, so she had to wait for them to stop. Fear pressed down on her chest. She tried to take a few deep breaths. She saw her pale reflection in the dark window and looked away.  

Then she heard the front door open, and Rasheed came back into the living room.  

"Get up," he said. "Come here. Get up." He grabbed her hand, opened it, and dropped some pebbles into it.  

"Put these in your mouth."  
"What?"  
"Put. These. In your mouth."  
"Stop it, Rasheed, I’m—"  

His strong hands held her jaw. He stuck two fingers into her mouth and forced it open, then pushed the cold, hard pebbles inside. Mariam fought back, mumbling, but he kept shoving the pebbles in, his upper lip twisted in anger.  

"Now chew," he said.  

With a mouth full of grit and pebbles, Mariam mumbled a plea. Tears were running down her face.  

"CHEW!" he yelled. His smoky breath hit her face hard.  

Mariam chewed. Something at the back of her mouth cracked.  

"Good," Rasheed said. His cheeks were shaking. "Now you know what your rice tastes like. Now you know what you’ve given me in this marriage. Bad food and nothing else."  

Then he left, leaving Mariam to spit out pebbles, blood, and pieces of two broken teeth.
