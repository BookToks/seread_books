" he mewled, mimicking her. "What's the matter is that you've done it again." "But I boiled it five minutes more than usual." "That's a bold lie." "I swear " He shook the rice angrily from his fingers and pushed the plate away, spilling sauce and rice on the sofrah. Mariam watched as he stormed out of the living room, then out of the house, slamming the door on his way out.
 
 Mariam kneeled to the ground and tried to pick up the grains of rice and put them back on the plate, but her hands were shaking badly, and she had to wait for them to stop. Dread pressed down on her chest. She tried taking a few deep breaths. She caught her pale reflection in the darkened living room window and looked away.
 
 Then she heard the front door opening, and Rasheed was back in the living room.
 
 "Get up," he said. "Come here. Get up." He snatched her hand, opened it, and dropped a handful of pebbles into it.
 
 "Put these in your mouth." "What?" "Put. These. In your mouth." "Stop it, Rasheed, I'm " His powerful hands clasped her jaw. He shoved two fingers into her mouth and pried it open, then forced the cold, hard pebbles into it. Mariam struggled against him, mumbling, but he kept pushing the pebbles in, his upper lip curled in a sneer.
 
 "Now chew," he said.
 
 Through the mouthful of grit and pebbles, Mariam mumbled a plea. Tears were leaking out of the corners of her eyes.
 
 "CHEW!" he bellowed. A gust of his smoky breath slammed against her face.
 
 Mariam chewed. Something in the back of her mouth cracked.
 
 "Good," Rasheed said. His cheeks were quivering. "Now you know what your rice tastes like. Now you know what you've given me in this marriage. Bad food, and nothing else." Then he was gone, leaving Mariam to spit out pebbles, blood, and the fragments of two broken molars.
