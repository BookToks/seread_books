The shopkeeper gave Tariq a bus ticket and told him to take the coat to a friend near the Lahore Rail Station.

"I already knew what was going on," Tariq said. "He warned me that if I got caught, I was on my own. He also said he knew where my mom lived. But the money was too good, and winter was coming." "How far did you get?" Laila asked.

"Not far," he said, laughing a bit embarrassed. "I never even got on the bus.

I thought I was safe, like there was someone watching over me, keeping track, and saying, 'It's okay, he's paid his dues.'" The coat had hashish hidden in it, and it spilled all over the street when the police cut it open.

Tariq laughed again, a shaky laugh. Laila remembered how he used to laugh like that when they were kids, to hide feeling embarrassed or to make fun of the silly things he did.

"He has a limp," Zalmai said. "Is this who I think it is?" "He was just visiting," Mariam said.

"Shut up," Rasheed snapped, raising his finger. Then he looked at Laila. "Well, what do you know? Laili and Majnoon together again. Just like old times." His face got hard. "So you let him in. Here. In my house. You let him in. He was here with my son." 

"You tricked me. You lied," Laila said, angry. "You had that man sit across from me... You knew I would leave if I thought he was alive." 

"AND YOU DIDN'T LIE TO ME?" Rasheed yelled. "You think I didn’t figure it out about your bastard? You think I’m a fool, you whore?"

The more Tariq talked, the more Laila was scared for when he would stop. The silence that would follow meant it was her turn to explain everything – the why, how, and when. She felt a little sick whenever he paused. She looked away from his eyes and stared at his hands, noticing the dark hairs that had grown there over the years.

Tariq didn’t say much about his time in prison, only that he learned to speak Urdu there.
