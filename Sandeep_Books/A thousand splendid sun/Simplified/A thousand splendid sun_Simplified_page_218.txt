"Tell her she is the light of my eyes and the queen of my heart. Will you do that for me?" Laila nodded, pressing her lips together.

"Take the bus, like I said, and keep your head down." "When will I see you, Mariam? I want to see you before I speak in court. I'll tell them what really happened. I'll explain that it wasn’t your fault. That you had no choice. They’ll understand, right, Mariam? They’ll understand." Mariam looked at her kindly.

She crouched down to be eye level with Zalmai. He wore a red T-shirt, old khaki pants, and a worn pair of cowboy boots Rasheed had bought from Mandaii. He held his new basketball with both hands. Mariam kissed his cheek.

"Be a good, strong boy, now," she said. "Take care of your mother." She held his face. He pulled away, but she didn’t let go. "I am so sorry, Zalmai jo. Believe me, I’m really sorry for all your pain and sadness." Laila held Zalmai’s hand as they walked down the road together. Just before they turned the corner, Laila looked back and saw Mariam at the door. Mariam wore a white scarf on her head, a dark blue sweater buttoned up, and white cotton pants. A patch of gray hair had fallen over her forehead. Sunlight made bright stripes on her face and shoulders. Mariam waved kindly.

They turned the corner, and Laila never saw Mariam again.
