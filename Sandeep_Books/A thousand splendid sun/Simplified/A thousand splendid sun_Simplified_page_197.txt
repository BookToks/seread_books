Upstairs, in Mariam's room, Zalmai was full of energy. He bounced his new rubber basketball around on the floor and against the walls. Mariam told him to stop, but he knew she couldn’t make him, so he kept bouncing the ball, looking at her like he was daring her to stop him. For a while, they played with his toy ambulance, pushing it back and forth across the room.

Earlier, when they met Tariq at the door, Zalmai held the basketball close and sucked his thumb, something he only did when he felt nervous. He looked at Tariq with distrust.

“Who is that man?” he asked. “I don’t like him.” Mariam wanted to explain that Tariq and Laila had grown up together, but Zalmai interrupted her. He told her to turn the ambulance around so the front faced him. When she did, he asked for his basketball again.

“Where is it?” he said. “Where is the ball Baba jan gave me? Where is it? I want it! I want it!” His voice got louder and more upset with each word.

“It was just here,” Mariam said. He cried, “No, it’s lost, I know it. I just know it’s lost! Where is it? Where is it?” 

“I found it,” she said, getting the ball from the closet where it had rolled. But Zalmai was crying hard and hitting his fists, saying this wasn’t the same ball. His ball was lost, and this one was fake. Where was his real ball? Where? 

He kept screaming, “Where, where, where?”

He cried until Laila came upstairs to hold him, rock him, and gently rub his curly hair. She wiped his wet cheeks and comforted him softly.

Mariam waited outside the room. From the top of the stairs, she could only see Tariq’s long legs—one real and one artificial—stretched out on the hard floor in the living room. Then she remembered why the doorman at the Continental Hotel looked familiar the day she and Rasheed had gone there to make a call to Jalil. He had been wearing a cap and sunglasses, so she hadn’t recognized him before.

Now she remembered him from nine years ago, sitting downstairs, wiping his forehead and asking for water. A lot of questions ran through her mind: Were the sulfa pills part of a trick? Who had planned the lie and made the story believable? And how much had Rasheed paid Abdul Sharif—if that was even his real name—to come and tell Laila that Tariq was dead?
