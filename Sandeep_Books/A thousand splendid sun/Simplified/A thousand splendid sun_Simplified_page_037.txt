"Tabreek. Congratulations."

Rasheed waited in the colorful bus. Mariam couldn’t see him from where she stood with Jalil, near the back of the bus, only the smoke from his cigarette rising from the open window. Around them, people shook hands and said goodbye. Barefoot boys ran between travelers, their faces hidden behind trays of gum and cigarettes.

Jalil was telling her how beautiful Kabul was. He said the emperor Babur wanted to be buried there. Mariam knew next he would talk about the gardens, the shops, the trees, and the fresh air. Soon, she would be on the bus and he would walk beside it, waving happily, safe and unharmed.

But Mariam couldn’t let that happen.

“I used to worship you,” she said.

Jalil stopped talking. He crossed and uncrossed his arms. A young couple with a baby walked past them. Jalil seemed glad for the distraction. They said sorry and he smiled politely.

“On Thursdays, I waited for you for hours. I worried you wouldn’t come.” “It’s a long trip. You should eat something.” He said he could buy her bread and cheese.

“I thought about you all the time. I prayed you’d live to be a hundred. I didn’t know. I didn’t know you were ashamed of me.” Jalil looked down and kicked at something with his shoe like a kid.

“You were ashamed of me.” “I’ll visit you,” he said quietly. “I’ll come to Kabul and see you. We’ll—” “No. No,” she said. “Don’t come. I won’t see you. Don’t come. I don’t want to hear from you. Ever. Ever.” He looked hurt.

“It ends here for us. Say your goodbyes.” “Don’t leave like this,” he said softly.

“You didn’t even give me the chance to say goodbye to Mullah Faizullah.”
