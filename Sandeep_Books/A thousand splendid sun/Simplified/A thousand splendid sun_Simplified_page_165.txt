In every damaged neighborhood, Mariam saw people coming out from the ruins and walking into the streets. She noticed an old woman throwing handfuls of rice at people walking by, smiling even though she had no teeth.

Two men were hugging near a destroyed building. Above them, boys on rooftops were setting off firecrackers that made whistling and popping sounds. The national anthem played on cassette players, mixed with the noise of car horns.

"Look, Mayam!" Aziza said, pointing to a group of boys running down Jadeh Maywand. They were pumping their fists in the air and pulling rusty cans tied to strings. They shouted that Massoud and Rabbani had left Kabul.

All around, people were shouting: Ailah u akbar!

Mariam saw a bedsheet hanging from a window on Jadeh Maywand. Someone had painted three big black words on it: Long live the Taliban!

As they walked, Mariam saw more signs saying the same thing, painted on windows, nailed to doors, and hanging from car antennas.

* * * Later that day, Mariam saw her first Taliban soldier at Pashtunistan Square with Rasheed, Laila, and Aziza. A crowd had gathered there. Mariam saw people stretching their necks, crowding around the blue fountain in the square’s center, and sitting on its dry base. They were trying to see the end of the square near the old Khyber Restaurant.

Rasheed pushed through the crowd and led them to a man speaking through a loudspeaker.

When Aziza saw him, she screamed and hid her face in Mariam’s burqa.

The voice came from a thin, bearded young man wearing a black turban. He stood on a makeshift platform and held a rocket launcher in one hand. Next to him, two men hung from ropes tied to traffic lights.

Their clothes were torn. Their swollen faces had turned purple and blue.

“I know him,” Mariam said about the man on the left. A young woman nearby said it was Najibullah. The other man was his brother. Mariam remembered Najibullah’s round face and mustache from old posters during the Soviet years.

Later, she would hear that the Taliban had taken Najibullah from the UN building near Darulaman Palace. They tortured him for hours and then tied his legs to a truck, dragging his dead body through the streets.

“He killed many, many Muslims!” the young Talib was shouting through the loudspeaker.

He spoke Farsi with a Pashto accent, then switched to Pashto. He pointed at the dead men with his weapon while talking. “Everyone knows his crimes. He was a communist and an infidel. This is what we do to people who commit crimes against Islam!” Rasheed was smiling.

Aziza started crying in Mariam’s arms.

* * * The next day, trucks took over Kabul.
