All the time. Look at me, Aziza. I will come and see you. 

I’m your mom. Even if it’s really hard, I will come and see you.

The orphanage director was a short man with a thin chest and a nice, wrinkled face. 

He was losing his hair, had a messy beard, and small eyes like peas. His name was Zaman. He wore a skullcap. One lens of his glasses was cracked.

As he took them to his office, he asked Laila and Mariam their names and Aziza’s name and age too. They walked through dark hallways where barefoot kids moved aside and stared. 

The children had messy hair or shaved heads. They wore old sweaters with ripped sleeves, torn jeans, and coats fixed with tape. Laila smelled soap, powder, a strong smell like cleaning stuff, and urine. She also felt Aziza getting scared and starting to cry softly.

Laila saw the yard for a moment: a messy field, a broken swing, old tires, and a flat basketball. The rooms they passed were empty, and the windows were covered with plastic. 

A boy suddenly ran up and grabbed Laila’s arm, trying to climb on her. A worker cleaning a puddle of urine set down his mop and took the boy away.

Zaman acted kindly with the orphans. He patted some kids on the head, said kind words, and played with their hair without acting like he was better than them.

The children liked his touch. Laila thought they all looked at him, hoping he would be proud of them.

He took them into his office, a small room with three folding chairs and a messy desk full of papers.

“You’re from Herat,” Zaman said to Mariam. “I can tell because of your accent.” He leaned back in his chair, folded his hands on his belly, and said he had a brother-in-law who lived there once. Even in small things, Laila saw he moved slowly and carefully. Though he smiled a little, she felt he was sad and hurt inside, hiding it behind a friendly face.

“He was a glassmaker,” Zaman said. “He made beautiful green glass swans. You held them up to the sun, and they sparkled like they had tiny jewels inside.”

“Have you been back?” Mariam said no.

“I’m from Kandahar,” Zaman said. “Have you ever been to Kandahar, hamshira? No? It’s beautiful. 

The gardens! And the grapes! The grapes are amazing.” A few kids gathered by the door and looked in. Zaman gently told them to go away in Pashto.

“Of course, I love Herat too. It’s a city of artists and writers, Sufis and mystics. There’s an old joke that says you can’t stretch your leg in Herat without poking a poet in the rear.”
