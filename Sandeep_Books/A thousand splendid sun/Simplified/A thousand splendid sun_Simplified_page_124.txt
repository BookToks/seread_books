Mariam asked, "Do you know who I am?" The girl's eyes blinked slowly. "Do you know what happened?" The girl's lips trembled. She closed her eyes and swallowed. Her hand touched her left cheek. She tried to say something.

Mariam moved closer.

"This ear," the girl whispered. "I can't hear."

For the first week, the girl mostly slept, helped by the pink pills Rasheed bought at the hospital. She talked quietly in her sleep. Sometimes she said things that didn’t make sense, cried out, or called names Mariam didn’t know. She cried while sleeping, got upset, kicked off the blankets, and Mariam had to hold her down. Sometimes she threw up everything Mariam fed her.

When she wasn’t upset, the girl just stared from under the blanket and gave short answers to Mariam and Rasheed’s questions. Some days, she acted like a child and shook her head when Mariam or Rasheed tried to feed her. She tensed up when Mariam tried to feed her with a spoon, but she got tired and finally let them feed her. After that, she would cry for a long time.

Rasheed told Mariam to put antibiotic ointment on the cuts on the girl’s face and neck, and on the stitches on her shoulder, arms, and legs. Mariam cleaned and reused the bandages. She held the girl’s hair back when she had to throw up.

"How long is she staying?" Mariam asked Rasheed.

"Until she gets better. Look at her. She’s not ready to leave. Poor thing."

Rasheed was the one who found the girl, digging her out from under the rubble.

"Lucky I was home," he said to the girl. He sat on a folding chair next to Mariam’s bed, where the girl lay. "Lucky for you, I mean. I dug you out myself. There was a piece of metal this big," he said, showing with his fingers a size bigger than it really was. "It was stuck in your shoulder. I thought I might have to use pliers to get it out.

But you’re okay now. Soon, you’ll be good as new." Rasheed also saved some of Hakim’s books.

"Most of them were burned," he said.
