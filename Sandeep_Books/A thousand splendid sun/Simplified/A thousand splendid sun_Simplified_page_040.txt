Mariam felt a deep sadness for Nana, for Mullah Faizullah, and for her old life.

Then she started crying.

“Why are you crying?” Rasheed asked angrily. He reached into his pocket, opened Mariam’s fingers, and put a handkerchief in her hand. He lit a cigarette and leaned against the wall. He watched as Mariam wiped her eyes with the handkerchief.

“Done?” he asked. Mariam nodded.

“Are you sure?” “Yes.” He grabbed her elbow and took her to the living room window.

“This window faces north,” he said, tapping the glass with his finger. “That’s Asmai mountain right in front of us, see? To the left is Ali Abad mountain. The university is at the bottom of it. Behind us, to the east, you can’t see it from here, is Shir Darwaza mountain. Every day at noon, they fire a cannon from there. Stop crying now. I mean it.” Mariam wiped her eyes again.

“That’s one thing I hate,” he said with a frown, “the sound of a woman crying. I’m sorry, but I can’t stand it.”

“I want to go home,” Mariam said.

Rasheed sighed, annoyed. Smoke from his cigarette blew in Mariam’s face. “I won’t take that personally. Not this time.” He grabbed her elbow again and took her upstairs.

There was a narrow, dim hallway and two bedrooms. The bigger bedroom door was open a little. Mariam saw it was simple, like the rest of the house: a bed in the corner with a brown blanket and pillow, a closet, and a dresser. The walls were empty except for a small mirror. Rasheed closed the door.

“This is my room,” he said. He told her she could use the guest room. “I hope you don’t mind. I’m used to sleeping alone.” Mariam didn’t tell him how relieved she felt about that.

The room Mariam would stay in was much smaller than the one she had at Jalil’s house.
