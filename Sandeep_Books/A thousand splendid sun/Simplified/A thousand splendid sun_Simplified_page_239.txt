They stop and watch the car go by. The driver turns, and they pass a cemetery with an old, worn-down mausoleum in the middle. The driver says a village Sufi is buried there.

There is also a windmill nearby. In its shadow, three little boys are sitting on the ground playing with mud. The driver stops and leans out the window. The oldest boy answers and points to a house farther up the road. The driver thanks him and starts driving again.

He stops outside a low, walled house. Laila sees fig trees above the walls, with some branches hanging over.

"I won't be long," she tells the driver.

A middle-aged man opens the door. He is short and thin with reddish hair and a beard with gray streaks. He wears traditional clothes.

They greet each other.

"Is this Mullah Faizullah’s house?" Laila asks.

"Yes. I am his son, Hamza. Can I help you, sister?"

"I came about an old friend of your father’s, Mariam." Hamza blinks, confused. "Mariam…" 

"Jalil Khan’s daughter."

He blinks again, then smiles widely, showing missing and rotten teeth.

"Oh!" he says, sounding surprised. "Oh! Mariam! Are you her daughter? Is she—" He twists his neck and looks behind Laila, hoping to see her. "Is she here? It’s been so long! Is Mariam here?"

"She has passed away, I’m afraid." Hamza’s smile fades.

They stand quietly for a moment. A donkey brays somewhere.

"Come in," Hamza says, opening the door wide. "Please come in."

They sit on the floor in a simple room. There is a Herati rug, beaded cushions, and a framed photo of Mecca on the wall. They sit by the open window, with sunlight shining between them. Laila hears women whispering from another room.
