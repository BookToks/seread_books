It was always about the baby, or when he was really annoyed, that thing.

Some nights, Mariam heard them arguing. She quietly went to their door and listened to him complain about the baby—always the baby—the crying, the smells, the toys that made him trip, and how the baby took all of Laila's attention because she needed to be fed, burped, changed, walked, and held. Laila, in return, scolded him for smoking in the room and not letting the baby sleep with them.

Other arguments happened in low voices.

"The doctor said six weeks." "Not yet, Rasheed. No. Let go. Come on. Don't do that." "It's been two months." "Shh. There. You woke up the baby." Then more sharply, "Happy now?" Mariam would quietly go back to her room.

"Can't you help?" Rasheed said now. "There must be something you can do." "What do I know about babies?" Mariam said.

"Rasheed! Can you bring the bottle? It's on the shelf. She won't feed. I want to try the bottle again." The baby's crying went up and down like a knife cutting meat.

Rasheed closed his eyes. "That thing is a warlord. Hekmatyar. I’m telling you, Laila’s given birth to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar."

Mariam watched as Laila’s days were filled with feeding, rocking, bouncing, and walking the baby. Even when the baby napped, there were dirty diapers to wash and soak in a bucket of disinfectant that Laila made Rasheed buy.

There were fingernails to trim with sandpaper, clothes to wash and hang to dry. These clothes, like other baby things, caused fights.

"What’s wrong with these?" Rasheed said. "They’re boys’ clothes. For a boy." "You think she knows the difference? I paid good money for these clothes. And another thing, don’t use that tone. Consider that a warning." Every week, without fail, Laila heated a black metal bowl over a flame, threw some wild rue seeds in it, and let the smoke float toward the baby to keep away evil.

Mariam found it tiring to watch Laila’s endless energy but secretly admired her. She noticed how Laila’s eyes sparkled with love, even in the mornings when she looked tired and pale from walking the baby all night. Laila laughed when the baby passed gas.

The smallest changes in the baby amazed her, and everything the baby did was amazing.

"Look! She’s reaching for the rattle. How smart she is." "I’ll call the newspapers," said Rasheed.

Every night, there were little shows. When Laila wanted him to watch something, Rasheed lifted his chin and gave her an annoyed sideways look. 

"Watch."
