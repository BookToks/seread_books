Her stomach felt sick when she remembered that afternoon lying on the floor with a bicycle wheel spoke between her legs. She had come so close. Now, she couldn’t believe she ever thought about it. Her son was a gift, and Laila was happy to find out her fears were wrong. She loved Zalmai deeply, just like she loved Aziza.

But Zalmai looked up to his father a lot, and when his dad was around, he acted very different. He would laugh loudly or smile cheekily. Around his father, he got upset easily. He held grudges and kept getting into trouble even when Laila told him not to, which he didn’t do when Rasheed was away.

Rasheed liked all this. “It means he’s smart,” he said. He said the same thing when Zalmai did risky things like swallowing marbles, lighting matches, or chewing Rasheed’s cigarettes.

When Zalmai was born, Rasheed moved him into the bed he shared with Laila. He bought a new crib with lions and leopards painted on the sides.

He paid for new clothes, rattles, bottles, and diapers, even though they couldn’t really afford them and Aziza’s old stuff still worked. One day, he came home with a mobile that he hung over Zalmai’s crib. It had yellow and black bumblebees hanging from a sunflower. They made crinkling and squeaking sounds when touched. A tune played when it was turned on.

“I thought business was slow,” Laila said.

“I can borrow from friends,” Rasheed said without caring.

“How will you pay them back?” she asked.

“Things will get better. They always do. Look, he likes it! See?” Rasheed said.

Most days, Laila didn’t get to spend much time with her son. Rasheed took him to his shop and let him crawl under his crowded workbench to play with old rubber soles and scraps of leather. Rasheed hammered nails and used sandpaper while watching him carefully. If Zalmai knocked over a rack of shoes, Rasheed would gently scold him with a calm half-smile. If it happened again, he stopped working, sat Zalmai on his desk, and talked to him softly.

Rasheed’s patience with Zalmai seemed endless.

They came home in the evening, Zalmai’s head bouncing on Rasheed’s shoulder, both smelling like glue and leather. They smiled like they shared a secret, as if they had spent the whole day not making shoes but planning something fun. Zalmai loved sitting next to his dad at dinner, where they played little games while Mariam, Laila, and Aziza put plates on the table. They poked each other, giggled, threw bread crumbs, and whispered things the others couldn’t hear. If Laila talked to them, Rasheed looked annoyed and didn’t like the interruption. If she asked to hold Zalmai or if Zalmai reached for her, Rasheed gave her a mean look.

Laila walked away feeling hurt.

Then one night, a few weeks after Zalmai turned two, Rasheed came home with a TV and a VCR. The day had been warm, but the evening was cooler and dark without stars. He set the TV on the living room table.
