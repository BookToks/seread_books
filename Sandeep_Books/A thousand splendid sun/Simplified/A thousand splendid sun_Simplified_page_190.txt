Next to Laila, Aziza snorted.

Zaman pretended to be surprised. "Ah, I made you laugh, little hamshira. That’s usually the hard part. I was worried for a while. I thought I’d have to make silly noises like a chicken or a donkey. But here you are. And you’re so lovely." He called someone to watch Aziza for a bit. Aziza jumped onto Mariam’s lap and held on tight.

"We’re just going to talk, my love," Laila said. "I’ll be right here. Okay? Right here." "Why don’t we go outside for a minute, Aziza jo?" Mariam said. "Your mother needs to talk to Kaka Zaman just for a little while. Come on." When they were alone, Zaman asked Aziza’s birthday, any illnesses, and allergies. He asked about Aziza’s father, and Laila felt weird telling a lie that was actually true. Zaman listened but didn’t show if he believed her or not. He said he ran the orphanage on trust. If a hamshira said her husband was dead and she couldn’t care for her kids, he didn’t question it.

Laila started to cry.

Zaman put down his pen.

"I’m ashamed," Laila said quietly, covering her mouth with her hand.

"Look at me, hamshira." "What kind of mother leaves her own child?" "Look at me." Laila looked up.

"It’s not your fault. Do you hear me? Not you. It’s those terrible people, the wahshis, who are to blame. They bring shame on me as a Pashtun. They have hurt the name of my people.

And you’re not alone, hamshira. We get mothers like you all the time — mothers who come here because they can’t feed their children since the Taliban won’t let them work. So don’t blame yourself. No one here blames you. I understand." He leaned forward. "Hamshira, I understand." Laila wiped her eyes with her burqa cloth.

"As for this place," Zaman sighed and waved his hand, "you can see it’s in bad shape. We never have enough money. We’re always trying to figure things out. We get little or no help from the Taliban. But we manage. Like you, we do what we have to do. Allah is good and kind, and Allah provides. As long as He provides, I will make sure Aziza is fed and clothed."
