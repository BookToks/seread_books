"Oh," she said, her voice shaking, barely able to speak, "Oh, Mariam."

Laila walked around, moaning and banging her hands, while Mariam sat near Rasheed, calm and still with her hands in her lap. Mariam stayed quiet for a long time.

Laila’s mouth felt dry, and she was stuttering, shaking all over. She tried not to look at Rasheed—his twisted mouth, his open eyes, and the blood drying on his collarbone.

Outside, the light was fading and shadows were getting darker. Mariam’s face looked thin and tired in the dim light, but she didn’t seem scared or upset. She looked lost in thought, so calm that when a fly landed on her chin, she didn’t even notice. She just sat there with her bottom lip sticking out, like she did when she was deep in thought.

Finally, she said, "Sit down, Laila jo." Laila listened and sat down.

"We have to move him. Zalmai can’t see this."

Mariam took the bedroom key from Rasheed’s pocket before they wrapped him in a bedsheet. Laila grabbed his legs behind the knees, and Mariam held him under the arms. They tried to lift him, but he was too heavy, so they dragged him instead. When they got to the front door and stepped outside, Rasheed’s foot caught on the doorframe and his leg bent the wrong way. They had to back up and try again. Then something banged upstairs, and Laila’s legs gave out. She dropped Rasheed and fell to the ground, sobbing and shaking. Mariam stood over her, hands on her hips, telling her to pull herself together. What was done was done. After a while, Laila got up, wiped her face, and they carried Rasheed to the yard without any more problems.

They put him in the toolshed, behind the workbench where his saw, nails, chisel, hammer, and a block of wood sat. Rasheed had wanted to carve the wood into something for Zalmai but never did. Then they went back inside. Mariam washed her hands, ran them through her hair, took a deep breath, and let it out. "Let me clean your wounds now. You’re all cut up, Laila jo."

Mariam said she needed the night to think. She needed time to figure things out and make a plan.

"There is a way," she said, "I just have to find it."
