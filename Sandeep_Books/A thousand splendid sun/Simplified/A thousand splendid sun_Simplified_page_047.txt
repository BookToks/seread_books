"Tomorrow is Friday," Rasheed said. "How about I show you around?"  
"Around Kabul?"  
"No. Calcutta." Mariam blinked.  

"It's a joke. Of course Kabul. Where else?" He reached into the brown paper bag. "But first, I have to tell you something." He pulled out a sky blue burqa from the bag. The long cloth fell over his knees as he lifted it. He rolled it up and looked at Mariam.  

"I have customers, Mariam, men who bring their wives to my shop. The women come without covering their faces, they talk to me directly, and look me in the eye without shame. They wear makeup and skirts that show their knees. Sometimes they even put their feet in front of me, for measurements, and their husbands just stand there and watch. They okay it.  

They don't think twice about a stranger touching their wives' bare feet! They think they're modern men, smart because they went to school, I guess. But they don’t see that they’re ruining their own honor and pride." He shook his head.  

"Mostly, they live in the richer parts of Kabul. I'll take you there. You'll see. But they're here too, Mariam, right in this neighborhood, these weak men. There's a teacher down the street, Hakim is his name, and I see his wife Fariba all the time walking alone with only a scarf on her head. It makes me embarrassed, honestly, to see a man who’s lost control of his wife." He gave Mariam a hard look.  

"But I’m different, Mariam. Where I come from, one wrong look or one wrong word can lead to bloodshed. Where I come from, a woman’s face is only her husband’s business. I want you to remember that. Do you understand?" Mariam nodded. When he handed the bag to her, she took it.  

The happiness she felt earlier because he liked her cooking was gone. Instead, she felt small and scared. This man's will seemed as strong and unmovable as the big Safid koh mountains near Gul Daman.  

Rasheed gave her the paper bag. "We have an understanding, then. Now, let me have some more of that daal."
