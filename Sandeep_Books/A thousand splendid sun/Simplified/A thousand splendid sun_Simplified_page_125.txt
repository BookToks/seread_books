"The rest were stolen, I'm afraid." He helped Mariam take care of the girl that first week. One day, he came home from work with a new blanket and pillow. Another day, he brought a bottle of pills.

"Vitamins," he said.

It was Rasheed who told Laila that her friend Tariq's house was now taken over.

"A gift," he said. "From one of Sayyaf’s commanders to three of his men. A gift. Ha!" The three men were actually boys with sun-tanned, young faces. Mariam saw them when she passed by, always in their army clothes, sitting by Tariq's front door, playing cards and smoking, their guns resting against the wall. The strongest one, who looked proud and mean, was the leader. The youngest was the quietest and didn’t seem to fully join in with his friends’ bold attitude. He started smiling and nodding politely when Mariam went by.

When he did, some of his fake confidence disappeared, and Mariam saw a small hint of kindness that wasn’t spoiled yet.

Then one morning, rockets hit the house. Later people said the rockets were fired by the Hazaras of Wahdat. For a while, neighbors kept finding pieces of the boys.

"They deserved it," said Rasheed.

The girl was really lucky, Mariam thought, to get away with only small injuries, even though the rocket had turned her house into burning ruins. Slowly, the girl got better. She started eating more and brushing her own hair. She bathed by herself. She even began eating downstairs with Mariam and Rasheed.

But sometimes memories would come up suddenly, and she would become quiet or grumpy. She would withdraw and collapse. She looked pale. She had nightmares and sudden moments of sadness. She would sometimes throw up.

And sometimes she felt guilty.

"I shouldn’t even be here," she said one day.

Mariam was changing the sheets. The girl sat on the floor, her bruised knees pulled up close.

"My father wanted to take out the boxes. The books. He said they were too heavy for me.

But I wouldn’t let him. I was so excited. I should’ve been the one inside the house when it happened." Mariam smoothed the clean sheet on the bed. She looked at the girl’s blond curls, her slim neck and green eyes, her high cheekbones and full lips. Mariam remembered seeing her on the streets when she was little, wobbling after her mother going to the bread oven, riding on her younger brother’s shoulders, the one with the patch of hair on his ear. Playing marbles with the carpenter’s boy.

The girl looked at Mariam, waiting for some advice or kind words. But what advice did Mariam have? What kind words? Mariam remembered the day they buried Nana and how little comfort she found when Mullah Faizullah read from the Koran. Blessed is He in Whose hand is the kingdom, and He Who has power over all things, Who created death and life that He may test you.
