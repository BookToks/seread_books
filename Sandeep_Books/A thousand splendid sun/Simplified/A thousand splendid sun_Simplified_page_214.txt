"We have to leave! We can't stay here," Laila said, her voice shaky and tired. She suddenly thought about the sound the shovel made hitting Rasheed's head, and she felt sick.

Mariam waited quietly until Laila felt a little better. Then she helped Laila lie down and gently stroked her hair. Mariam told her not to worry, that everything would be okay. She said they would all leave—Laila, herself, the kids, and Tariq too. They would leave this house, this harsh city. They would leave this sad country completely. Mariam said they would go somewhere far away and safe, where no one could find them, where they could forget the past and find peace.

"Somewhere with trees," she said. "Yes, lots of trees." They would live in a small house near a town they didn’t know, or in a quiet village where the road was rough but surrounded by plants. Maybe there would be a path leading to a grassy field where the children could play, or a gravel road that went to a clear blue lake with fish swimming and reeds growing. They would keep sheep and chickens, bake bread together, and teach the kids to read.

They would start new lives—peaceful and quiet—and the heavy pain they’d felt would go away. They would deserve all the happiness and simple good things they found.

Laila whispered softly. She knew this life would have problems, but good ones—problems they could be proud of, like a treasured family gift. Mariam’s calm, motherly voice made her feel better. Mariam said there was a way, and in the morning, she would tell Laila what to do. Maybe by then, they would be on their way to this new life, full of hope, joy, and welcome challenges. Laila was thankful Mariam was in charge, clear-headed and calm, because her own mind was a jumbled mess.

Mariam stood up. "You should take care of your son now." Her face looked the saddest Laila had ever seen.

Laila found her son in the dark, curled up on Rasheed's side of the bed. She slipped under the covers next to him and pulled the blanket over both of them.

"Are you asleep?" she asked. Without turning to her, he said, "Not yet. Baba jan hasn’t said the Babaloo prayers with me."

"Maybe I can say them with you tonight."
