War, hunger, chaos, and unfair treatment made millions of people like Tariq and his family leave their homes and run away from Afghanistan to live in nearby countries like Pakistan and Iran. At the worst time, about eight million Afghans were living outside their country as refugees. Today, more than two million Afghan refugees still live in Pakistan.

Over the past year, I have been lucky to work as a U.S. representative for UNHCR, the United Nations refugee agency. This group is one of the most important organizations that help people in need. UNHCRâ€™s job is to protect the basic human rights of refugees, give emergency help, and support refugees so they can start new lives in safe places. UNHCR helps more than twenty million people who had to leave their homes, not just in Afghanistan, but also in places like Colombia, Burundi, Congo, Chad, and the Darfur region of Sudan.

Working with UNHCR to help refugees has been one of the most rewarding and meaningful things I have ever done.

Thank you.
