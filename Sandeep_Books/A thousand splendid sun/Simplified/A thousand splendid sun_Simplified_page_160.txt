Order. But she kept quiet.

"If you send us back," she said slowly, "who knows what he will do to us." She could see how hard he was trying not to look away. "What a man does at home is his own business." "What about the law, then, Officer Rahman?" Tears of anger filled her eyes. "Will you keep order?" "We don’t get involved in family problems, hamshira," he said. "Of course you don’t. Only when it helps the man. And isn’t this a family problem, like you said? Isn’t it?" He pushed away from his desk and stood up, fixing his jacket. "I think this interview is over. I must say, hamshira, you have done a very bad job for yourself. Very bad. Now, wait outside. I want to talk to your… whoever she is." Laila started to argue, then shout, but he called two men to drag her out of his office.

Mariam’s interview was very short. When she came out, she looked upset.

"He asked so many questions," she said. "I’m sorry, Laila jo. I’m not smart like you. He asked so many things, and I didn’t know the answers. I’m sorry." "It’s not your fault, Mariam," Laila said weakly. "It’s mine. It’s all my fault."

It was after six o’clock when the police car stopped in front of the house. Laila and Mariam had to wait in the backseat, watched by a soldier sitting in the passenger seat. The driver got out, knocked on the door, and talked to Rasheed. He was the one who told them to come inside.

“Welcome home,” the man in the front seat said, lighting a cigarette.

"You," he said to Mariam. "Wait here." Mariam quietly sat on the couch.

"You two, go upstairs." Rasheed grabbed Laila’s arm and pushed her up the stairs. He was still wearing his work shoes, hadn’t changed to flip flops, hadn’t taken off his watch or coat yet. Laila imagined him a little while ago, rushing around, slamming doors, angry and shouting quietly.

At the top of the stairs, Laila turned to him.

"She didn’t want to do it," she said. "I made her. She didn’t want to go." Laila didn’t see the punch coming. One second she was talking, the next she was on her hands and knees, wide-eyed and red-faced, trying to breathe. It felt like a car hit her hard, right in the soft spot between her chest and stomach.
