Sleeping okay?

Eating and sleeping too. Yes. We had lamb last night. Maybe it was last week.

When Aziza talked like this, Laila saw a lot of Mariam in her.

Aziza started to stammer now. Mariam noticed it first. It was small but noticeable, and worse with words starting with /.

Laila asked Zaman about it. He frowned and said, "I thought she always talked like that." They left the orphanage with Aziza that Friday afternoon for a short trip and met Rasheed at the bus stop.

When Zalmai saw his father, he made an excited squeak and squirmed out of Laila’s arms. Aziza’s greeting to Rasheed was stiff but not mean.

Rasheed said they should hurry because he only had two hours before work. This was his first week as a doorman at the Intercontinental. From noon to eight, six days a week, he opened car doors, carried bags, and cleaned up spills.

Sometimes, at the end of the day, the cook at the buffet restaurant let Rasheed take home leftovers if he was quiet about it—cold meatballs in oil, dry fried chicken wings, chewy pasta, and hard rice. Rasheed promised Laila that when he saved enough money, Aziza could come live with them.

Rasheed wore his uniform: a burgundy red polyester suit, white shirt, clip-on tie, and a visor cap on his white hair. In this uniform, he looked different. He seemed weak, confused, and harmless—like someone who accepted all the hard things life gave him without complaining. Someone both sad and strong in how calm he was.

They took the bus to Titanic City. They walked into the riverbed, with small stalls on both sides along the dry banks. Near the bridge, as they walked down the steps, they saw a barefoot man hanging dead from a crane, his ears cut off, his neck bent from the rope.

In the riverbed, they mixed with a crowd of shoppers, money changers, bored NGO workers, cigarette sellers, and covered women who gave fake antibiotic prescriptions and begged for money.

Talibs carrying whips and chewing naswar watched Titanic City closely for people laughing loudly or showing their uncovered faces.

At a toy stand, between a coat seller and a fake flower stand, Zalmai picked a rubber basketball with yellow and blue swirls.

“Pick something,” Rasheed told Aziza.

Aziza hesitated, feeling shy.

“Hurry. I have to be at work in an hour.”

Aziza picked a gum ball machine where you could put in a coin to get candy and then take the coin back from the flap below.
