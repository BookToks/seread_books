Some people were still holding their babies. Some broke away from the crowd and ran toward the double doors that led to the treatment rooms. But an armed Talib guard stopped them and sent them back.

Mariam pushed her way in. She stood firm and squeezed through the elbows, hips, and shoulders of strangers. Someone hit her in the ribs, so she hit back. A hand reached for her face, and she pushed it away. To move forward, Mariam grabbed at necks, arms, elbows, and hair. When a woman near her hissed, Mariam hissed back.

Mariam now understood the sacrifices a mother makes. Being decent was just one part of it. She thought sadly of Nana and the sacrifices she made too. Nana could have given her away or left her somewhere and run. But she didn’t. Instead, Nana faced shame for having a harami and spent her life raising Mariam and, in her own way, loving her. In the end, Mariam had chosen Jalil over Nana. As she fought her way to the front, Mariam wished she had been a better daughter and understood motherhood better.

She found herself face to face with a nurse covered in a dirty gray burqa. The nurse was talking to a young woman whose burqa was soaked with blood. “My daughter’s water broke, and the baby won’t come,” Mariam said.

“I’m talking to her!” the young woman shouted. “Wait your turn!” The crowd swayed side to side like tall grass in the wind. A woman behind Mariam yelled her girl had broken her elbow falling from a tree. Another woman cried because she was bleeding badly.

“Does she have a fever?” the nurse asked. It took Mariam a moment to realize the question was for her.

“No,” Mariam said.

“Bleeding?”

“No.” Mariam pointed over the covered heads to where Laila sat with Rasheed.

“We’ll get to her,” the nurse said.

“How long?” Mariam asked. Someone grabbed her by the shoulders and pulled her back.

“I don’t know,” the nurse said. She said there were only two doctors and both were busy operating.

“She’s in pain,” Mariam said.

“Me too!” the woman with the bloody head yelled. “Wait your turn!” Mariam was being pulled back. Her view of the nurse was blocked by shoulders and heads. She smelled a baby’s milky burp.

“Take her for a walk,” the nurse shouted. “And wait.”

It was dark outside when a nurse finally called them in. The delivery room had eight beds where women moaned and moved, cared for by nurses fully covered in burqas.
