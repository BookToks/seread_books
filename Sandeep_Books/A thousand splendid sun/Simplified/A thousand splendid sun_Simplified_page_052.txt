Ramadan came in the fall of 1974. For the first time in her life, Mariam saw how the new crescent moon could change a whole city and its mood. She noticed a sleepy quiet take over Kabul. Traffic slowed down and became light, even quiet. Shops emptied. Restaurants turned off their lights and closed. Mariam saw no smokers on the streets and no cups of tea steaming on window ledges. At iftar, when the sun went down and a cannon fired from Shir Darwaza mountain, the city broke its fast. Mariam did too, eating bread and a date, feeling the sweetness of sharing this moment with everyone for the first time in her fifteen years.

But Rasheed didn’t fast much. When he did, he came home in a bad mood. Hunger made him short, angry, and impatient. One night, Mariam was a little late with dinner, so he started eating bread with radishes. Even after she put rice, lamb, and okra in front of him, he refused to eat it. He said nothing and kept chewing the bread, his face tense and angry. When Mariam talked to him, he looked at her without really seeing her and took another bite.

Mariam was glad when Ramadan ended.

Back at the kolba, during the three days of Eid ul Fitr after Ramadan, Jalil would visit Mariam and Nana. Wearing a suit and tie, he brought Eid gifts. One year, he gave Mariam a wool scarf. The three of them would have tea, then Jalil would leave. “Off to celebrate Eid with his real family,” Nana would say as he crossed the stream and waved goodbye. Mullah Faizullah also came, bringing Mariam chocolate candy wrapped in foil, a basket of dyed boiled eggs, and cookies.

After he left, Mariam would climb a willow tree with her treats. Sitting high on a branch, she ate the chocolates and dropped the foil wrappers, which scattered like silver flowers around the tree trunk. When the chocolates were gone, she started eating the cookies and drew faces on the eggs with a pencil. But she didn’t enjoy this much. Mariam hated Eid because it was a time of visiting and celebration when families dressed in their best clothes and saw each other. She imagined the air in Herat filled with happiness and people showering each other with love and good wishes. A deep sadness would fall over her then and only go away when Eid was over.

This year, for the first time, Mariam actually saw the Eid she had dreamed about as a child.

Rasheed and she went out on the streets. Mariam had never been around so much energy before.

Even though it was cold, families filled the city, busy visiting relatives. On their street, Mariam saw Fariba and her son Noor, who wore a suit. Fariba had a white scarf and walked beside a thin, shy man with glasses. Her older son was there too. Mariam remembered Fariba saying his name was Ahmad when they met at the tandoor. He had deep, serious eyes and looked more grown-up than his younger brother. Around Ahmad’s neck was a shiny Allah pendant.

Fariba must have recognized Mariam, walking in a burqa beside Rasheed.
