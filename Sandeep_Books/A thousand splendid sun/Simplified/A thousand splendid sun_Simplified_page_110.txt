"You know."  
"Know what?"  
"That I only have eyes for you."  

Laila felt weak inside. She tried to understand his face but saw a strange look: a silly smile that didn’t match the worried, almost desperate eyes. It was a smart look, meant to be halfway between joking and being serious.  

Tariq crushed his cigarette with his good foot. "So what do you think about all this?"  
"The party?"  
"Who’s the halfwit now? I meant the Mujahideen, Laila. They’re coming to Kabul." Oh.  

She was about to tell him something Babi had said about the dangerous mix of guns and pride when she heard loud voices and screaming from the house.  

Laila ran toward the noise. Tariq limped after her.  

There was a fight in the yard. Two angry men were rolling on the ground, fighting over a knife. Laila knew one of them was a man who had been talking about politics earlier. The other was the man who had been fanning the kebab skewers. Some men were trying to stop them. Babi wasn’t helping. He stood safely by the wall with Tariq’s father, who was crying.  

From what she heard, Laila put the story together: The man from the politics table, a Pashtun, had called Ahmad Shah Massoud a traitor for “making a deal” with the Soviets in the 1980s. The kebab man, a Tajik, got mad and asked him to take it back. The Pashtun refused. The Tajik said if not for Massoud, the Pashtun’s sister would still be with Soviet soldiers. They started fighting. One of them pulled a knife, but no one agreed on who.  

Laila was horrified when she saw Tariq jump into the fight. Some of the people trying to stop the fight started punching too. She thought she saw a second knife.  

Later that night, Laila remembered the fight falling apart, with men falling over each other, yelling, shouting, and punching. In the middle was Tariq, looking grim and messy, his leg loose, trying to crawl away.  

It was shocking how fast everything fell apart.
