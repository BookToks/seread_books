"What’s wrong with you?" "You're bleeding, hamshiral." Mariam turned one corner, then another. She found the right street but suddenly forgot which house was Rasheed's. She ran up and down the street, gasping for breath, almost crying, and started trying doors without thinking. Some were locked, others opened to strange yards, barking dogs, and shocked chickens. She imagined Rasheed coming home and finding her still lost on the street, her knee bleeding. Then she really started crying. She pushed on doors, saying scared prayers, tears on her face, until one opened. She felt relieved when she saw the outhouse, well, and toolshed. She slammed the door shut and locked it. Then she got down on her hands and knees and threw up. When she finished, she crawled away and sat against the wall with her legs stretched out. She had never felt so alone in her life.

When Rasheed came home that night, he brought a brown paper bag. Mariam was sad he didn’t notice the clean windows, the swept floors, or the missing cobwebs. But he looked happy that she had already set his dinner plate on a clean cloth spread on the living room floor.

"I made daal," Mariam said.

"Good. I'm starving." She poured water from the afiawa for him to wash his hands. As he dried them with a towel, she put a steaming bowl of daal and a plate of soft white rice in front of him. This was the first meal she had cooked for him, and Mariam wished she had been feeling better while making it. She was still shaken from what happened at the tandoor and had worried all day about the daal’s thickness and color, scared he might think she put in too much ginger or not enough turmeric.

He dipped his spoon into the golden daal.

Mariam felt shaky. What if he didn’t like it or got mad? What if he pushed his plate away?

"Careful," she said. "It’s hot." Rasheed blew on the spoon and then tasted the food.

"It’s good," he said. "A little under-salted but good. Maybe even better than good." Feeling relieved, Mariam watched him eat. Suddenly, she felt proud. She had done well—maybe even better than good—and this small compliment made her happy. The bad feelings from earlier that day faded a little.
