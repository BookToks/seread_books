For Laila, life in Murree is comfortable and peaceful. The work isn’t hard, and on their days off, she and Tariq take the kids to ride the chairlift to Patriata hill or go to Pindi Point. On a clear day, you can see all the way to Islamabad and downtown Rawalpindi. They spread a blanket on the grass, eat meatball sandwiches with cucumbers, and drink cold ginger ale.

Laila tells herself it’s a good life, a life to be thankful for. It’s exactly the kind of life she used to dream about during her hardest times with Rasheed. Every day, she reminds herself of this.

One warm night in July 2002, she and Tariq lie in bed, whispering about all the changes back home. So much has happened. The coalition forces have pushed the Taliban out of every major city. The Taliban have moved to Pakistan and the mountains in southern and eastern Afghanistan. An international peacekeeping force called ISAF has been sent to Kabul. The country now has an interim president named Hamid Karzai.

Laila decides it’s time to tell Tariq something.

A year ago, she would have given anything to leave Kabul. But lately, she’s been missing the city where she grew up. She misses the busy Shor Bazaar, the Gardens of Babur, and the water carriers carrying their goatskin bags.

She also misses the garment sellers at Chicken Street and the melon sellers in Karteh Parwan.

But it’s not just homesickness. Laila feels restless. She hears about schools being built in Kabul, roads getting fixed, and women going back to work. Even though her life here is nice and she is thankful, it feels… not enough. Small. Worse, like it’s wasted. Recently, she’s started hearing her father Babi’s voice in her head. “You can be anything you want, Laila,” he says. “I know this about you. And when this war ends, Afghanistan will need you.”

She also remembers her mother Mammy’s words to Babi when he wanted to leave Afghanistan. “I want to see my sons’ dream come true. I want to be there when it happens, when Afghanistan is free, so the boys can see it too. They’ll see it through my eyes.” 

Now, a part of Laila wants to go back to Kabul, for Mammy and Babi, to see it through her eyes.

Most of all, Laila thinks about Mariam. Did Mariam die for this? she asks herself. Did Mariam sacrifice so Laila could be a maid in a foreign land?

Maybe Mariam wouldn’t care what Laila did as long as she and the children were safe and happy. But it matters to Laila. Suddenly, it matters a lot.

“I want to go back,” she says.

Tariq sits up in bed and looks at her.

Laila is struck again by how handsome he is—his perfect forehead, strong arms, and deep, smart eyes.
