"It's the whistling," Laila told Tariq, "the damn whistling, I hate it more than anything." Tariq understood and nodded.

Later, Laila realized it wasn’t really the whistling itself that scared her, but the few seconds between when it started and when it hit. That short but endless feeling of waiting and not knowing what would happen next.

The waiting felt like being on trial, about to hear a verdict.

It often happened at dinner when she and Babi were eating. When the whistling began, they would both freeze. Their heads would snap up, forks stopped midair, food in their mouths. Laila saw their half-lit faces in the dark window and their still shadows on the wall. Then came the blast, far away, followed by a breath of relief because they were safe—for now. But somewhere else, there were screams and smoke, and people digging through rubble to find what was left of a sister, brother, or grandchild.

But being safe was painful too, because after every rocket, Laila ran outside, praying and hoping that this time it wasn’t Tariq buried under the wreckage.

At night, she lay in bed watching the sudden white flashes in her window.

She listened to the sound of automatic gunfire and counted rockets flying overhead as the house shook and bits of plaster fell from the ceiling. Some nights, the rocket fire was so bright she could read by it, but she couldn’t sleep. When she did sleep, her dreams were full of fire, broken bodies, and the cries of the hurt.

Morning didn’t help either. The muezzin’s call to prayer rang out, and the fighters put down their guns to pray facing west. Then they picked up their guns again, and the mountains fired on Kabul, and Kabul fired back. Laila and the city watched helplessly, like an old fisherman watching sharks eat his big fish.

Everywhere Laila went, she saw Massoud’s men. They walked the streets, stopped cars, sat on tanks smoking, dressed in uniforms and their pakol hats. They watched people from behind sandbags at intersections.

Laila didn’t go out much anymore. When she did, Tariq always came with her, proud to protect her.

One day, sitting outside under the pear tree in her yard, Tariq told her, "I bought a gun." He showed her a semiautomatic Beretta. To Laila, it just looked black and deadly.
