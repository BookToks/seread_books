It was wrong, even sinful, to think these thoughts. Allah was not mean. He was not a small-minded God. Mullah Faizullah’s words stayed in her head: Blessed is He in Whose hand is the kingdom, and He Who has power over all things, Who created death and life that He may test you.

Feeling full of guilt, Mariam would kneel and pray for forgiveness for these thoughts.

At the same time, Rasheed had changed since the day at the bathhouse. Most nights when he came home, he barely talked anymore. He ate, smoked, went to bed, and sometimes came back in the middle of the night for a short and lately rough time together.

He was more likely to sulk now, complain about her cooking, get annoyed by clutter in the yard, or point out small messes in the house. Sometimes, he took her around town on Fridays like before, but he walked fast and always a few steps ahead, not talking and not caring if Mariam had to rush to keep up. He didn’t laugh much on these walks anymore.

He didn’t buy her sweets or gifts, and didn’t stop to tell her the names of places like he used to. Her questions seemed to bother him.

One night, they were sitting in the living room listening to the radio. Winter was ending.

The cold winds that blew snow onto their faces and made their eyes water had calmed down.

Silver bits of snow were melting off the tall elm trees and would soon be replaced by small, pale green buds. Rasheed was shaking his foot quietly to the beat of a Hamahang song, his eyes squinting through cigarette smoke.

“Are you angry with me?” Mariam asked.

Rasheed didn’t say anything. The song ended and the news started. A woman’s voice said that President Daoud Khan had sent another group of Soviet advisors back to Moscow, which upset the Kremlin.

“I worry that you are angry with me.” Rasheed sighed. “Are you?” He looked at her. “Why would I be angry?” “I don’t know, but ever since the baby—” “Is that the kind of man you think I am, after everything I’ve done for you?” “No.”
