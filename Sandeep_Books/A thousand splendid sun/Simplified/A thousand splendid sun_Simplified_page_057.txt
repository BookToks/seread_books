As he started to saw it in half, he said the stairs worried him. "We’ll have to fix them later, when he’s old enough to climb." The stove worried him too. The knives and forks would have to be put somewhere he couldn’t reach. "You can’t be too careful. Boys are reckless." Mariam wrapped her shawl tighter around her because it was cold.

The next morning, Rasheed said he wanted to invite his friends over for dinner to celebrate. All morning, Mariam cleaned lentils and soaked rice. She sliced eggplants for borani and cooked leeks and ground beef for aushak. She swept the floor, shook out the curtains, and aired the house, even though it was snowing again. She put mattresses and cushions along the living room walls and placed bowls of candy and roasted almonds on the table.

She went to her room early in the evening before the men arrived. She lay in bed as the sounds of hooting, laughter, and talking downstairs grew louder. She kept touching her belly. She thought about the baby growing inside her, and happiness rushed in like a strong wind opening a door. Her eyes filled with tears.

Mariam remembered the long 650-kilometer bus trip with Rasheed, from Herat in the west near Iran to Kabul in the east. They passed small towns, big towns, and lots of little villages. They crossed mountains and dry deserts, moving from one province to another. Now, she had a home and a husband of her own, and she was heading toward something special: motherhood. It felt wonderful to think about this baby, her baby, their baby. Her love for it was bigger than anything she had ever felt. She didn’t care about little problems anymore.

Downstairs, someone started tuning a harmonium. Then there was the sound of a hammer tuning a tabla. Someone cleared their throat. Then came whistling, clapping, yipping, and singing.

Mariam touched her soft belly. The doctor said the baby was no bigger than a fingernail.

I’m going to be a mother, she thought.

"I'm going to be a mother," she said again and laughed quietly, enjoying saying it.

When Mariam thought about the baby, her heart felt full. It filled up so much that all the pain, sadness, loneliness, and shame she had felt before went away.

This was why God had brought her here, all the way across the country. She understood that now.

She remembered a verse from the Koran that Mullah Faizullah had taught her: And Allah is the East and the West, so wherever you turn there is Allah’s purpose…
