"Of course not."  
"Then stop bothering me!"  
"I'm sorry. Please forgive me, Rasheed. I'm sorry."  

He put out his cigarette and lit another one. Then he turned up the radio volume.  

"I've been thinking," Mariam said, raising her voice so he could hear over the music.  

Rasheed sighed again, this time more annoyed. He turned the volume down. He rubbed his forehead tiredly. "What now?"  
"I've been thinking maybe we should have a proper burial for the baby. Just us, a few prayers, nothing big."  

Mariam had been thinking about it for a while. She didn’t want to forget the baby. It felt wrong not to remember this loss in some lasting way.  

"What for? That’s stupid."  
"It would make me feel better, I think."  
"Then you do it," he said sharply. "I’ve already buried one son. I won’t bury another.  

Now, if you don’t mind, I’m trying to listen." He turned the volume up again, leaned back, and closed his eyes.  

One sunny morning that week, Mariam picked a spot in the yard and dug a hole.  

"In the name of Allah and with Allah, and in the name of the messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and give him peace," she whispered as her shovel hit the ground. She put the suede coat Rasheed had bought for the baby into the hole and covered it with dirt.  

"You make the night turn into day and the day into night. You bring the living from the dead and the dead from the living. You give food and care to whoever You want without counting."  

She pressed the dirt down with the back of the shovel. Then she crouched by the little mound and closed her eyes.  

Give food and care, Allah.  

Give food and care to me.
