That was the only time Mammy said anything all morning.

Babi ended up sitting alone on a folding chair in the hallway, looking sad and small. Then one of the women told him he was in the way there. He apologized and went back to his study.

* * * That afternoon, the men went to a hall in Karteh Seh that Babi had rented for the fatiha.

The women came to the house. Laila sat next to Mammy, near the living room entrance where the family of the dead usually sits. People took off their shoes at the door, nodded to people they knew as they walked by, and sat on folding chairs along the walls. Laila saw Wajma, the old midwife who helped deliver her. She also saw Tariq's mother wearing a black scarf over a wig. She nodded at Laila and gave a slow, sad smile.

From a cassette player, a man’s nasal voice chanted verses from the Koran. Between verses, the women sighed, shifted, and sniffled. There were soft coughs and whispers, and sometimes someone made a loud, sad sob.

Rasheed's wife, Mariam, came in. She wore a black hijab. Strands of her hair showed on her forehead. She sat across from Laila along the wall.

Next to Laila, Mammy kept rocking back and forth. Laila took Mammy’s hand and held it with both of hers, but Mammy didn’t seem to notice.

“Do you want some water, Mammy?” Laila whispered. “Are you thirsty?” But Mammy said nothing. She just kept rocking and stared at the rug with a blank, lifeless look.

Sitting next to Mammy, seeing the sad faces around the room, Laila sometimes understood how big the disaster was for her family.

The chances lost. The hopes crushed.

But the feeling didn’t last. It was hard to really feel Mammy’s loss. Hard to feel sad for people Laila had never really thought of as alive. Ahmad and Noor had always seemed like stories she heard, like characters from a fairy tale or kings from a history book.

Tariq was the real one, alive and real. Tariq, who taught her swear words in Pashto, who liked salted clover leaves, who frowned and made a low sound when he chewed, who had a light pink birthmark under his left collarbone shaped like an upside-down mandolin.

So she sat beside Mammy and mourned Ahmad and Noor, but deep down, her true brother was still alive and well.
