APRIL 1992  
Three years went by.

During that time, Tariq’s dad had several strokes. They made his left hand clumsy and his speech a little slurred. When he got upset, which was often, his speech got even worse.

Tariq grew out of his leg again and got a new one from the Red Cross, but he had to wait six months for it.

As Hasina had worried, her family took her to Lahore and made her marry her cousin who owned an auto shop. The morning they took her, Laila and Giti went to say goodbye. Hasina told them her future husband was already working to move them to Germany, where his brothers lived. She thought they would be in Frankfurt within a year. They cried together, and Giti was very upset. The last time Laila saw Hasina, her dad was helping her into the crowded backseat of a taxi.

And finally, they did. In April 1992, the year Laila turned fourteen.

Najibullah gave up and was allowed to live in the UN compound near Darulaman Palace, south of the city.

The jihad was over. The communist governments that had ruled since Laila was born were all defeated. Mammy’s heroes, Ahmad’s and Noor’s brothers in war, had won. After many years of sacrifice, leaving their families to fight in the mountains for Afghanistan’s freedom, the Mujahideen were coming to Kabul, tired but victorious.

Mammy knew all their names.

There was Dostum, a flashy Uzbek commander who led the Junbish-i-Milli group and was known for changing sides.
