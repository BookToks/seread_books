Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was a tough and serious leader of the Hezb-e-Islami group. He was a Pashtun who studied engineering and once killed a Maoist student. Rabbani, the leader of the Jamiat-e-Islami group, was a Tajik who taught Islam at Kabul University when there was a monarchy. Sayyaf was a Pashtun from Paghman with Arab roots. He was a strong Muslim and led the Ittehad-i-Islami group.

Abdul Ali Mazari led the Hizb-e-Wahdat group. People called him Baba Mazari, and he had close Shi'a ties to Iran.

And of course, there was Mammy’s hero, Rabbani’s friend, the serious and charming Tajik commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, also known as the Lion of Panjshir. Mammy had put up a poster of him in her room. Massoud’s handsome, thoughtful face with his raised eyebrow and pakol hat would be seen all over Kabul. His deep black eyes stared back from billboards, walls, shop windows, and small flags on taxi antennas.

For Mammy, this was the day she had waited for so long. It made all those years of waiting finally feel worth it.

At last, she could stop her long watches, and her sons could finally rest in peace.

The day after Najibullah gave up, Mammy woke up feeling like a new person. For the first time in five years since Ahmad and Noor had died, she didn’t wear black.

She put on a bright blue dress with white dots. She cleaned the windows, swept the floor, let fresh air in the house, and took a long bath. Her voice was high and happy.

“We need to have a party,” she said. She sent Laila to invite the neighbors. “Tell them we’re having a big lunch tomorrow!” In the kitchen, Mammy looked around with her hands on her hips and said in a friendly way, “What have you done to my kitchen, Laila? Everything is in a different place.” She started moving pots and pans around like she was taking back control of the kitchen now that she was back. Laila stayed out of her way because Mammy could be just as strong when she was happy as when she was angry.

Full of energy, Mammy began cooking: aush soup with kidney beans and dried dill, kofia, and hot maniu covered with fresh yogurt and mint.

“You’re plucking your eyebrows,” Mammy said while opening a big sack of rice by the counter.

“Just a little,” Laila replied. Mammy poured rice into a large black pot of water. She rolled up her sleeves and started stirring.

“How is Tariq?”
