Tariq has headaches now.

Some nights, Laila wakes up and finds him sitting on the edge of their bed, rocking back and forth with his undershirt pulled over his head. He says the headaches started in Nasir Bagh and got worse in prison.

Sometimes the headaches make him throw up and blind him in one eye. He says it feels like a butcher’s knife is digging into one side of his head, twisting slowly through his brain, and poking out the other side.

“I can even taste metal when they start.” Sometimes Laila wets a cloth and puts it on his forehead, which helps a little. The small white pills from Sayeed’s doctor help too. But some nights, all Tariq can do is hold his head and moan, his eyes red and his nose running. Laila sits with him during these times, rubs his neck, and holds his hand. His wedding ring feels cold in her palm.

They got married the day they arrived in Murree. Sayeed looked relieved when Tariq told him. He didn’t have to deal with an unmarried couple living in his hotel. Sayeed wasn’t what Laila expected. He has a salt-and-pepper mustache with sharp tips and long gray hair combed back. He speaks softly and moves gracefully.

Sayeed called a friend and a mullah to perform the wedding that day. He gave Tariq money, even though Tariq didn’t want to take it. Tariq went to the Mall and bought two simple wedding rings. They got married that night after the kids went to sleep.

In the mirror, under the green veil the mullah put over their heads, Laila looked into Tariq’s eyes. There were no tears or smiles or promises of forever. She saw their faces in the reflection, older than their age, with lines and sagging skin. Tariq started to say something, but someone pulled the veil and Laila missed his words.

That night, they lay in bed as husband and wife, while the children snored below. Laila remembered how they used to talk fast and laugh a lot when they were younger, always interrupting and teasing each other. So much had happened since then, and so much was left unsaid. But that night, the weight of everything made her quiet. It was enough just to be next to him, to feel his warmth, to lie with their heads touching and hands held tightly.
