"You'll see." "I'll count the minutes." It had been almost ten years since they last saw each other. Laila remembered all the times they met in the alley, kissing in secret. She wondered how she looked to him now. Did he still think she was pretty? Or did she look old, weak, and sad to him? Almost ten years. But standing there with Tariq in the sunlight, it felt like those years never happened. Her parents' deaths, her marriage to Rasheed, the killings, the rockets, the Taliban, the beatings, the hunger, even her children, all felt like a strange dream, just a break between that last afternoon and now.

Then Tariq's face changed and looked serious. She knew this look. It was the same one he had when they were kids, the day he unstrapped his leg and went after Khadim. He reached out and touched the corner of her lower lip.

"He did this to you," he said coldly.

When he touched her, Laila remembered that wild afternoon again when they made Aziza. His breath on her neck, his muscles moving, his chest against hers, their hands holding tight.

"I wish I'd taken you with me," Tariq whispered.

Laila looked down, trying not to cry.

"I know you're married and have kids now. And here I am, after all these years and everything that happened, showing up at your door. Maybe it’s not right or fair, but I came so far to see you, and… Oh, Laila, I wish I never left you." "Don't," she said quietly.

"I should have tried harder. I should have married you when I could. Things would be different now." "Please don’t talk like that. It hurts." He nodded and started to step closer, then stopped.

"I don’t want to assume anything. I don’t want to mess up your life by showing up like this. If you want me to leave, if you want me to go back to Pakistan, just say it, Laila. I mean it. Say it and I’ll go. I’ll never bother you again. I’ll—" "No!" Laila said louder than she wanted. She saw she was holding his arm, then let go. "No. Don’t leave, Tariq. No. Please stay."
