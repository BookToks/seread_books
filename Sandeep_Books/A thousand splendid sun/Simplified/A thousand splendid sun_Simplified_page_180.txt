In the summer of 2000, the drought was in its third and worst year.

In Helmand, Zabol, and Kandahar, villages became groups of nomads, always moving, looking for water and green grass for their animals. When they couldn’t find any, and their goats, sheep, and cows died, they came to Kabul. They lived on the Kareh Ariana hillside in makeshift slums, crowded in small huts, with fifteen or twenty people in each.

That was also the summer of Titanic. Mariam and Aziza were always rolling around and laughing, with Aziza insisting she be Jack.

“Quiet, Aziza jo.” “Jack! Say my name, Khala Mariam. Say it. Jack!” “Your father will be angry if you wake him.” “Jack! And you’re Rose.” It always ended with Mariam on her back, giving in, agreeing to be Rose. “Fine, you be Jack,” she said. “You die young, and I get to live to be really old.” “Yes, but I die a hero,” said Aziza, “while you, Rose, spend your whole sad life wishing for me.” Then, sitting on Mariam’s chest, she’d say, “Now we must kiss!” Mariam shook her head side to side, and Aziza laughed, happy with her cheeky behavior.

Sometimes Zalmai would come in and watch their game. “What do I get to be?” he asked. “You can be the iceberg,” said Aziza.

That summer, everyone in Kabul was crazy about Titanic. People smuggled fake copies of the movie from Pakistan, sometimes hidden in their underwear. After curfew, everyone locked their doors, turned off the lights, turned down the volume, and cried for Jack, Rose, and the people on the sinking ship. If there was electricity, Mariam, Laila, and the kids watched it too. They dug out the TV from behind the toolshed late at night, with the lights off and quilts over the windows.

At the Kabul River, sellers moved into the dry riverbed. Soon, you could buy Titanic carpets and Titanic cloth from piles in wheelbarrows. There was Titanic deodorant, toothpaste, perfume, pakora, even Titanic burqas. A beggar started calling himself “Titanic Beggar.” “Titanic City” was born.

“It’s the song,” some said.

“No, it’s the sea. The luxury. The ship,” others said.

“It’s the sex,” they whispered. Leo, said Aziza quietly. It’s all about Leo.

“Everybody wants Jack,” Laila told Mariam. “That’s it. Everyone wants Jack to save them from disaster. But there is no Jack. Jack isn’t coming back. Jack is dead.”

Then, late that summer, a fabric seller fell asleep and forgot to put out his cigarette. He survived the fire, but his store did not.
