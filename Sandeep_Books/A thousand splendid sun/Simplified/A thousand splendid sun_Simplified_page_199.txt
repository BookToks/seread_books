And his dad, with his squinty eyes and dry sense of humor. Earlier, at the door, her voice shaky and full of tears, she told Tariq what she thought had happened to him and his parents, but he shook his head. So now she asked how his parents were doing. She wished she hadn’t when Tariq looked down and said, a little distracted, "Passed on." "I'm so sorry." "Yeah. Me too. Here." He pulled a small paper bag from his pocket and gave it to her. Inside was a block of cheese wrapped in plastic.

"Alyona. That’s a pretty name." Laila tried to say this without sounding unsure. "Your wife?" "My goat." He smiled at her like he was waiting for her to remember something.

Then Laila remembered. The old Soviet movie. Alyona was the captain’s daughter, the girl in love with the first mate. That was the day she, Tariq, and Hasina watched Soviet tanks and jeeps leave Kabul, and Tariq wore that silly Russian fur hat.

"I had to tie her to a stake in the ground," Tariq said. "And build a fence because of the wolves. Near where I live, in the foothills, there’s a forest about a quarter mile away with mostly pine trees, some fir, and deodars. The wolves usually stay in the woods, but a goat that likes to wander can attract them. So I made the fence and the stake." Laila asked which foothills.

"Pir Panjal, Pakistan," he said. "I live in Murree. It’s a summer place, about an hour from Islamabad. It’s hilly and green, with lots of trees, and high up so it’s cool in summer. Perfect for tourists." The British made it as a hill station near their military base in Rawalpindi for Victorians to escape the heat. You can still see some old British things, like tearooms and small tin-roofed cottages. The town is small and nice. The main street is called the Mall, with a post office, a market, some restaurants, and shops that charge tourists too much for painted glass and hand-made carpets. The Mall’s one-way traffic goes one way one week, then the opposite way the next week.

"The locals say Ireland has traffic like that too," Tariq said. "But I wouldn’t know."

Anyway, it’s nice. It’s a simple life, but I like it. I like living there." "With your goat. With Alyona." Laila said this not as a joke but as a way to start another conversation, like who else was with him worrying about wolves and goats.
