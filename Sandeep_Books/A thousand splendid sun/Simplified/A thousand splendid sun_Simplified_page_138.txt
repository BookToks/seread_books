"Is there something you want?"  
"Mariam jan, I want to… About what he said the other night."  
"I’ve been wanting to talk to you about it," Mariam said quickly.

"Yes, please," the girl said, almost excited. She stepped forward and looked relieved.

Outside, a bird was singing. Someone was pulling a cart, and Mariam could hear the wheels rattling. Then she heard gunshots nearby—one shot, then three more—and then silence.

"I won’t be your servant," Mariam said. "I won’t." The girl flinched.  
"No, of course not!"  
"You may be the palacemalika and I’m the adehati, but I won’t take orders from you. You can tell him, and he can kill me, but I won’t do it. Do you hear me? I won’t be your servant."  
"No! I don’t expect that."  
"And if you think your looks will make me leave, you’re wrong. I was here first. I won’t be pushed out. I won’t let you throw me away."  
"It’s not what I want," the girl said softly.

"And I see your wounds are healed now, so you can start helping with the work in this house." The girl nodded fast. She spilled some tea but didn’t notice.  
"Yes, that’s why I came down—to thank you for taking care of me."  
"Well, I wouldn’t have," Mariam said sharply. "I wouldn’t have fed you or washed you if I knew you were going to steal my husband."  
"Steal—"  
"I will still cook and wash dishes. You will do laundry and sweeping. We’ll take turns with the rest. And one more thing: I don’t want your company. I want to be alone. You leave me alone, and I’ll leave you alone. That’s how we’ll get along. Those are the rules."  

When she finished, her heart was pounding and her mouth felt dry.

Mariam had never spoken like this before or been so firm. It should have felt good, but the girl’s eyes were full of tears and she looked sad. The little satisfaction Mariam felt seemed wrong somehow.

She held out the shirts to the girl.

"Put them in the almari, not the closet. He likes the whites in the top drawer, the rest in the middle, and the socks there." The girl put her cup down and held out her hands to take the shirts.  
"I'm sorry about all this," she said quietly.

"You should be," Mariam said. "You should be sorry."
