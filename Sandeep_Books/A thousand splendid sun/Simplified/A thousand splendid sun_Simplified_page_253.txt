The village of Gul Daman is made up, as far as I know. People who know the city of Herat will see that I changed some details about the area around it.

The title of this novel comes from a poem by Saeb-e-Tabrizi, a Persian poet from the 1600s. If you know the original poem in Farsi, you might notice that the English translation of the line with the title isn’t exact. But it’s the common translation by Dr. Josephine Davis, and I thought it was beautiful. I’m thankful to her.

I want to thank Qayoum Sarwar, Hekmat Sadat, Elyse Hathaway, Rosemary Stasek, Lawrence Quill, and Haleema Jazmin Quill for their help and support.

A very special thanks to my dad, Baba, for reading this manuscript, giving feedback, and always loving and supporting me. And to my mom, whose kind and caring spirit is everywhere in this story. You are my reason, Mother jo. Thanks also to my in-laws for their kindness and generosity. To my whole family, I’m grateful to each of you.

I want to thank my agent, Elaine Koster, for always believing in me, Jody Hotchkiss (Onward!), David Grossman, Helen Heller, and the hardworking Chandler Crawford. I’m thankful to everyone at Riverhead Books. Especially Susan Petersen Kennedy and Geoffrey Kloske, who believed in this story. Big thanks also to Marilyn Ducksworth, Mih Ho Cha, Catharine Lynch, Craig D. Burke, Leslie Schwartz, Honi Werner, and Wendy Pearl. Special thanks to my sharp-eyed copy editor, Tony Davis, who catches everything, and to my talented editor, Sarah McGrath, for her patience, vision, and guidance.

Finally, thank you, Roya. For reading this story over and over, for being there during my small and big moments of doubt, and for never giving up on me. This book wouldn’t exist without you. I love you.
