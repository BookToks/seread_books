Something hot and strong hit her from behind. It knocked off her sandals. It lifted her up. Now she was flying, twisting and turning in the air, seeing the sky, then the ground, then the sky, then the ground again. A big burning piece of wood flew past her. So did thousands of glass pieces, and Laila thought she could see every single one spinning slowly, shining in the sunlight like tiny rainbows.

Then Laila hit the wall. She crashed to the ground. Dirt, pebbles, and glass fell on her face and arms. The last thing she saw was something fall nearby. A bloody piece of something. On it, the tip of a red bridge poking through thick fog.

Shapes moved around her. A bright light shone from the ceiling. A woman’s face appeared, hovering over her.

Laila faded back to darkness.

* * *

Another face appeared. This time a man’s. His face looked wide and tired. His lips moved but no sound came out. All Laila heard was ringing.

The man waved his hand at her and frowned. His lips moved again.

It hurt. It hurt to breathe. It hurt everywhere.

A glass of water. A pink pill.

Back to the darkness.

* * *

The woman came back. She had a long face and narrow eyes. She said something. Laila couldn’t hear, just the ringing. But she could see the words, like thick black syrup, coming out of the woman’s mouth.

Her chest hurt. Her arms and legs hurt.

Shapes moved all around her.

Where was Tariq?

Why wasn’t he there?

Darkness. A bunch of stars.

Babi and she were sitting somewhere high up. He pointed to a field of barley. A generator started.

The long-faced woman stood over her, looking down.

It hurt to breathe.

Somewhere, an accordion was playing.

Thank goodness, the pink pill again. Then everything went very quiet. A deep quiet fell over everything.
