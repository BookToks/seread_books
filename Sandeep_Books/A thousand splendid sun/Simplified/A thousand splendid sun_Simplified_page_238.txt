"I'll be okay," Laila says. "I promise. Take the kids to a market. Buy them something." Zalmai starts crying when the taxi drives away, and when Laila looks back, she sees him reaching for Tariq. Seeing him start to accept Tariq makes Laila both happy and sad at the same time.

"You're not from Herat," the driver says.

He has dark, shoulder-length hair—a common style that shows he doesn’t support the old Taliban—and a scar on the left side of his mustache. There is a photo taped to his windshield. It’s of a young girl with pink cheeks and two braids.

Laila tells him she has been in Pakistan for the last year and is now going back to Kabul.

"Deh Mazang." Through the windshield, she sees people making brass handles for jugs and saddle makers drying rawhide in the sun.

"Have you lived here long, brother?" she asks.

"Oh, my whole life. I was born here. I’ve seen everything. Do you remember the uprising?" Laila says she does, but he keeps talking.

"This was back in March 1979, about nine months before the Soviets invaded. Some angry people from Herat killed a few Soviet advisers, so the Soviets sent tanks and helicopters and bombed this place. For three days, they fired on the city. They destroyed buildings, broke one of the minarets, and killed thousands of people. Thousands. I lost two sisters in those three days. One was only twelve." He taps the photo on his windshield. "That’s her."

"I’m sorry," Laila says, amazed at how every Afghan story has so much death, loss, and sadness. But she also sees that people still find a way to survive and keep going. She thinks about her own life and all that has happened to her, and she’s surprised she is still alive, sitting in this taxi, listening to this man’s story.

Gul Daman is a village with a few houses surrounded by flat huts made from mud and straw. Outside the huts, Laila sees women cooking, their faces hot and sweaty from the steam rising from big black pots on makeshift fires. Mules eat from troughs. Children chase chickens and run after the taxi. Laila sees men pushing wheelbarrows full of stones.
