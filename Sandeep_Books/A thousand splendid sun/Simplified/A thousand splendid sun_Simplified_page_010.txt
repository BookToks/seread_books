For almost two days, you made me lie on that cold, hard floor. I didn’t eat or sleep; all I did was push and hope you would come out." "I’m sorry, Nana." "I cut the cord between us myself. That’s why I had a knife." "I’m sorry." Nana always gave a slow, tired smile here, one that felt like she was still upset or maybe forgiving, but Mariam could never tell which. Young Mariam never thought about how unfair it was to say sorry for how she was born.

By the time she was about ten, Mariam stopped believing this story about her birth. She believed Jalil’s version instead, that even though he was away, he made sure Nana went to a hospital in Herat where a doctor helped her. She lay on a clean, proper bed in a bright room. Jalil looked sad when Mariam told him about the knife.

Mariam also started to doubt that her mother had suffered for two whole days.

"They told me it was all done in less than an hour," Jalil said. "You were a good daughter, Mariam jo. Even when you were born, you were good." "He wasn’t even there!" Nana said angrily. "He was in Takht-e-Safar, riding horses with his friends." When they told him he had a new daughter, Nana said, Jalil just shrugged, kept brushing his horse’s mane, and stayed in Takht-e-Safar for two more weeks.

"The truth is, he didn’t hold you until you were a month old. And then only looked at you once, said your face was kind of long, and gave you back to me." Mariam didn’t believe this part either. Jalil admitted he was riding horses in Takht-e-Safar, but when he heard the news, he didn’t just shrug.

He jumped on his horse and rode back to Herat. He held her in his arms, gently touched her eyebrows, and sang a lullaby. Mariam couldn’t imagine Jalil saying her face was long, even though it was true.

Nana said she picked the name Mariam because it was her mother’s name. Jalil said he chose it because Mariam, the tuberose, was a beautiful flower.

"Your favorite?" Mariam asked.

"Well, one of them," he said and smiled.
