"Come on, you two," Babi said. "Come outside and take a look." They got out of the taxi. Babi pointed. "There they are. Look." Tariq gasped. Laila did too. She knew right then that even if she lived to be a hundred, she would never see anything as amazing.

The two Buddhas were huge, much taller than she had thought from the pictures. They were carved into a sun-bleached rock cliff, looking down at them like they had almost two thousand years ago, watching caravans cross the valley on the Silk Road. On each side of the statues, the cliff had lots of caves.

"I feel so small," Tariq said.

"Do you want to climb up?" Babi asked.

"Up the statues?" Laila said. "We can do that?" Babi smiled and held out his hand. "Come on." 

The climb was hard for Tariq, who had to hold on to both Laila and Babi as they carefully went up a narrow, winding, and dim staircase. They saw dark caves along the way and tunnels going in every direction in the cliff.

"Be careful where you step," Babi said. His voice echoed loudly. "The ground is tricky." In some spots, the stairs were open to the inside of the Buddha.

"Don’t look down, kids. Keep looking straight ahead." While they climbed, Babi told them that Bamiyan used to be a busy Buddhist center until the Islamic Arabs took over in the ninth century. The sandstone cliffs were home to Buddhist monks who carved caves to live in and to rest tired travelers. The monks painted beautiful pictures on the walls and ceilings of the caves.

"At one time," he said, "five thousand monks lived alone in these caves." Tariq was out of breath when they reached the top. Babi was tired too, but his eyes were bright with excitement.

"We’re standing on top of its head," he said, wiping sweat from his forehead. "There’s a spot here where we can look out."
