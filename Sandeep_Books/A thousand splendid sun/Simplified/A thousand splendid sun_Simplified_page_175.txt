Laila FALL 1999  

It was Mariam’s idea to dig the hole. One morning, she pointed to some dirt behind the toolshed. “We can do it here,” she said. “This is a good spot.”  

They took turns hitting the ground with a spade and then shoveling the loose dirt away. They didn’t want a big or deep hole, so the digging shouldn’t have been too hard. But the drought, which started in 1998 and was now in its second year, made everything worse.  

It barely snowed last winter and didn’t rain at all that spring. Farmers all over the country left their dry lands, sold their things, and moved from village to village looking for water. Some went to Pakistan or Iran. Others stayed in Kabul. But the water was low there too, and the shallow wells were dry. Lines at the deep wells were so long, Laila and Mariam spent hours waiting their turn.  

The Kabul River, which usually flooded in spring, was now completely dry. It was just a dirty mess with trash and waste.  

So they kept digging, but the sun had baked the ground hard like rock. The dirt wouldn’t give in.  

Mariam was forty now. Her hair was rolled up above her face and had some gray streaks.  

She had dark, crescent-shaped bags under her eyes. She had lost two front teeth.  

One tooth fell out, and Rasheed knocked out the other when she dropped Zalmai by accident. Her skin was rough and tanned from all the time they spent outside in the hot sun. They would sit and watch Zalmai chase Aziza.  

When the hole was finally dug, they stood over it and looked down.  

“It should do,” Mariam said.

Zalmai was two years old. He was a chubby little boy with curly hair. He had small brown eyes and rosy cheeks, like his father, no matter the weather. He also had his dad’s hairline—thick and shaped like a half moon, low on his forehead.  

When Laila was alone with him, Zalmai was sweet, funny, and playful. He liked to climb on her shoulders and play hide and seek in the yard with her and Aziza. Sometimes, when he was calm, he liked to sit on her lap and have her sing to him.  

His favorite song was “Mullah Mohammad Jan.” He swung his chubby little feet as she sang into his curly hair and joined in when she reached the chorus, singing the words he could say with his raspy voice:  

“Come and let’s go to Mazar, Mullah Mohammadjan,  
To see the fields of tulips, oh beloved companion.”  

Laila loved the wet kisses Zalmai gave her on the cheeks. She loved his dimpled elbows and chunky little toes. She loved tickling him, making tunnels with cushions and pillows for him to crawl through, and watching him fall asleep in her arms with one hand always holding her ear.
