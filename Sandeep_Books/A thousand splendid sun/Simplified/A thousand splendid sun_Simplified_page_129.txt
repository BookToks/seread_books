I told him who I was and where I came from. He seemed happy to have a fellow Afghan next to him.

I did most of the talking because it was hard for him. His voice was rough, and I think it hurt for him to move his lips. So, I told him about my daughters, our house in Peshawar, and the porch my brother-in-law and I are building. I said I had sold the stores in Kabul and was going back to finish the paperwork. It wasn’t much, but it kept him busy. At least, I like to think it did.

Sometimes he talked too. Half the time, I couldn’t understand what he said, but I caught some of it. He told me about where he had lived. He talked about his uncle in Ghazni, his mother’s cooking, his father’s carpentry, and how he played the accordion.

Mostly, though, he talked about you, hamshira. He said you were his earliest memory. I think that’s right. I could tell he cared a lot about you. That much was clear. But he said he was glad you weren’t there. He didn’t want you to see him like that. My feet felt heavy, stuck to the floor, like all my blood had rushed down there. But my mind was far away, flying fast over Kabul, hills, deserts, red rocks, and snowy mountains…

When I told him I was going back to Kabul, he asked me to find you and tell you he was thinking of you and missed you. I promised I would. I had started to like him a lot; he seemed like a good kid. Abdul Sharif wiped his forehead with a handkerchief.

One night, I woke up. I think it was night, but it’s hard to tell in places like that. There were no windows, so you don’t know when it’s sunrise or sunset. But I woke up because there was noise around the bed next to mine. I was full of drugs and kept drifting in and out, so I wasn’t sure what was real. But I remember doctors all around, calling out, alarms beeping, syringes on the floor.

The next morning, the bed was empty. I asked a nurse, and she said he fought hard. I was nodding, even though I barely noticed. I had known from the start why he was there and what news he was bringing.

At first, I didn’t even think you were real. I thought it was the morphine talking. Maybe I even hoped you weren’t real because I hate giving bad news. But I promised him, and I had grown to like him. So a few days ago, I came here and asked around for you. Neighbors told me where you lived and what happened to your parents. When I heard, I turned around and left. I didn’t want to tell you—it would be too much for you or anyone.

But I came back because I think he would have wanted you to know. I’m so sorry. I wish… 

I wasn’t listening anymore. I was remembering the day the man from Panjshir came to tell me about Ahmad’s and Noor’s deaths.
