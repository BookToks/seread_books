Laila was happy that when the Taliban took over, Babi wasn’t there to see it. It would have broken his heart.

Men with pickaxes rushed into the damaged Kabul Museum and smashed old statues into pieces. Many had already been stolen by fighters before. The university was closed and students sent home. Paintings were ripped off walls and cut up. TV screens were smashed. Books, except the Koran, were burned in big piles, and the stores that sold them were shut down. Poems by many famous poets were burned too.

Laila heard that men were being dragged off the streets for not praying and forced into mosques. She found out that the Marco Polo Restaurant near Chicken Street was now a place where people were questioned. Sometimes she heard screams from inside. All over, the Beard Patrol drove around in trucks looking for men without beards to hurt.

They closed the cinemas too—Cinema Park, Ariana, Aryub. Film rooms were destroyed and movies were burned. Laila remembered all the times she and Tariq watched Hindi movies there, with their sad stories about lovers kept apart by bad luck, crying, singing in flower fields, and hoping to be together again. Tariq used to tease her for crying at those films.

One day, Mariam asked, "I wonder what happened to my dad’s cinema. If it’s still there, or if he even owns it now." Kharabat, the old music neighborhood in Kabul, was silent. Musicians were beaten and put in jail. Their instruments were smashed. The Taliban went to the grave of Tariq’s favorite singer, Ahmad Zahir, and shot it.

“He’s been dead for almost twenty years,” Laila told Mariam. “Isn’t dying once enough?”

Rasheed wasn’t scared of the Taliban. All he had to do was grow a beard, which he did, and go to the mosque, which he did too. Rasheed saw the Taliban like a strange, wild cousin who did crazy things but you still cared about.

Every Wednesday night, Rasheed listened to the Voice of Shari'a where the Taliban said who would be punished. Then on Fridays, he went to Ghazi Stadium, bought a Pepsi, and watched the punishments. In bed, he made Laila listen as he talked excitedly about the hands he’d seen cut off, the lashings, the hangings, and the beheadings.

“One night, I saw a man cut the throat of the man who killed his brother,” he said, blowing smoke rings.

“They’re savages,” Laila said.
