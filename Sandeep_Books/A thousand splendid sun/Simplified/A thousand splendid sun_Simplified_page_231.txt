The TV is on BBC. On the screen, there is a building, a tower, with black smoke coming out of its top floors. Tariq says something to Sayeed, and Sayeed is about to answer when a plane suddenly appears on the screen. It crashes into the other tower, making a huge fireball bigger than anything Laila has ever seen. Everyone in the lobby gasps.

In less than two hours, both towers fall down. Soon, all the TV channels are talking about Afghanistan, the Taliban, and Osama bin Laden.

"Did you hear what the Taliban said?" Tariq asks. "About bin Laden?" Aziza is sitting across from him on the bed, thinking about the chess game. Tariq has taught her how to play. She is frowning and biting her lip, copying the way her dad looks when he thinks about his next move.

Zalmai's cold is a little better. He is sleeping, and Laila is putting Vicks on his chest.

"I heard," she says.

The Taliban said they won’t give up bin Laden because he is a guest who found safety in Afghanistan. According to their code, it is wrong to hand over a guest. Tariq laughs bitterly, and Laila can tell he is upset that they are twisting the meaning of this honorable custom.

A few days after the attacks, Laila and Tariq are back in the hotel lobby. On the TV, George W. Bush is talking. There is a big American flag behind him. At one point, his voice shakes, and Laila thinks he might cry.

Sayeed, who speaks English, tells them that Bush has just declared war.

"On who?" Tariq asks.

"On your country, first," Sayeed answers.

"It might not be such a bad thing," Tariq says.

They have just finished making love. He is lying next to her, his head on her chest, his arm over her belly. The first few times they tried, it was hard. Tariq kept apologizing, and Laila kept telling him it was okay. There are still problems, but now they are not physical—they are about their situation.

The small shack they live in with the children is tiny. The kids sleep on beds below them, so there is little privacy. Most times, Laila and Tariq make love quietly, with low passion, fully dressed under the blanket to avoid being interrupted by the kids.
