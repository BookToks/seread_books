Her beauty was the talk of the valley. It skipped two generations of women in our family, but it definitely didn’t skip you, Laila. The valley Mammy talked about was Panjshir, the Farsi-speaking Tajik area about one hundred kilometers northeast of Kabul. Both Mammy and Babi, who were first cousins, were born and raised in Panjshir. They moved to Kabul in 1960 as hopeful, excited newlyweds when Babi got into Kabul University.

Laila hurried downstairs, hoping Mammy wouldn’t come out of her room for another argument. She found Babi kneeling by the screen door.

“Did you see this, Laila?” The rip in the screen had been there for weeks. Laila crouched down beside him. “No. Must be new.” “That’s what I told Fariba.” He looked upset and small, like he always did after Mammy had scolded him. “She says it’s been letting in bees.” Laila felt sorry for him. Babi was a small man with narrow shoulders and thin, delicate hands, almost like a girl’s. At night, when Laila went into Babi’s room, she always found him buried in a book, his glasses sitting on the tip of his nose. Sometimes he didn’t even notice she was there. When he did, he marked his page and gave a small, friendly smile. Babi knew most of Rumi’s and Hafez’s poems by heart. He could talk a lot about the fight between Britain and Russia over Afghanistan. He knew the difference between stalactites and stalagmites and could tell you the distance from the earth to the sun was the same as going from Kabul to Ghazni one and a half million times. But if Laila needed help opening a candy jar, she had to ask Mammy, which felt like a betrayal. Babi was bad with everyday tools. When he was in charge, squeaky door hinges never got oiled. Ceilings kept leaking after he tried to fix them. Mold grew in the kitchen cabinets. Mammy said that before he left with Noor to fight the Soviets in 1980, it was Ahmad who took care of these things well.

“But if you have a book that needs urgent reading,” she said, “then Hakim is your man.” Still, Laila felt that once, before Ahmad and Noor went to war and before Babi let them go, Mammy had thought Babi’s love of books was sweet. Maybe she once found his forgetfulness and clumsiness charming.

“So what day is it today?” he said now, smiling shyly. “Day five? Or is it six?” “I don’t care. I don’t keep track,” Laila lied, shrugging, loving him for remembering that Mammy didn’t know Tariq had left.

“Well, his flashlight will be going off before you know it,” Babi said, talking about Laila and Tariq’s nightly signaling game. They had played it for so long it had become a bedtime routine, like brushing teeth.
