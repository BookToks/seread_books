"I'm really sorry," Rasheed said to the girl, taking his bowl of masiawa and meatballs from Mariam without looking at her. "I know you were really close… like best friends. You two have always been together since you were kids. What happened is awful. Too many young Afghan men are dying like this." He waved his hand impatiently while looking at the girl, and Mariam gave him a napkin.

For years, Mariam had watched him eat, his temple muscles moving, one hand making small rice balls, the other wiping grease and stray grains from his mouth. He ate without looking up or talking, his silence feeling like judgment, broken only by a grunt, a click of his tongue, or a short command for more bread or water.

Now he ate with a spoon, used a napkin, said "lotfan" when asking for water, and talked.

He talked a lot and with energy.

"If you ask me, the Americans gave guns to the wrong guy in Hekmatyar. The CIA gave him guns in the eighties to fight the Soviets. The Soviets are gone, but he still has the guns, and now he's using them against innocent people like your parents. And he calls this jihad? What a joke! What does jihad have to do with killing women and kids? The CIA should have armed Commander Massoud instead." Mariam’s eyebrows raised. In her head, she remembered Rasheed’s angry words about Massoud, calling him a traitor and a communist. But Massoud was a Tajik, like Laila.

"Now there’s a reasonable guy. An honorable Afghan. Someone who really wants peace." Rasheed shrugged and sighed.

"Not that America cares, though. They don’t care that Pashtuns, Hazaras, Tajiks, and Uzbeks are fighting each other. How many Americans can even tell them apart? Don’t expect help from them, I say. Now that the Soviets are gone, we’re useless to them. We served our purpose. To them, Afghanistan is a dump. Excuse my language, but it's true. What do you think, Laila jan?" The girl mumbled something and pushed a meatball around her bowl.

Rasheed nodded like she’d said something really smart.

Mariam looked away.

"You know, your father, God bless him, we used to have talks like this. Before you were born, of course. We’d talk and talk about politics.

And books too. Didn’t we, Mariam? You remember." Mariam took a sip of water to keep busy.

"Anyway, I hope I’m not boring you with all this politics." Later, Mariam was in the kitchen, soaking dishes in soapy water, feeling a tight knot in her stomach. It wasn’t just what he said—the lies, the fake sympathy, or even that he hadn’t hit her since he pulled the girl out from under those bricks.
