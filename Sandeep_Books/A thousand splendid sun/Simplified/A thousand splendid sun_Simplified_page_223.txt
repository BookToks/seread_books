She dreamed of pebbles, eleven of them, lined up one on top of the other. Jalil, looking young again with his big smile and dimples, sweat stains on his shirt, coat thrown over his shoulder, finally came to take his daughter for a ride in his shiny black Buick Roadmaster. Mullah Faizullah spun his rosary beads as he walked with her by the stream, their shadows moving together on the water and the grassy banks covered with blue wild iris flowers that smelled like cloves in her dream. She dreamed of Nana standing in the doorway of the small house, her voice soft and far away, calling her to dinner, while Mariam played in the cool, messy grass where ants crawled, beetles ran, and grasshoppers jumped among many shades of green. She heard the squeak of a wheelbarrow going up a dusty path. Cowbells rang out. Sheep bleated on a hill.

On the way to Ghazi Stadium, Mariam bounced in the back of the truck as it slid around potholes, and its wheels threw up pebbles. The bouncing hurt her tailbone. A young, armed Talib sat across from her, staring at her.

Mariam wondered if he would be the one—the friendly-looking young man with deep bright eyes, a slightly pointed face, and a black-painted finger tapping the side of the truck.

"Are you hungry, mother?" he asked.

Mariam shook her head.

"I have a biscuit. It’s good. You can have it if you want. I don’t mind."

"No. Tashakor, brother." He nodded and looked at her kindly. "Are you scared, mother?"

A lump formed in her throat. In a shaky voice, Mariam told him the truth.

"Yes. I’m very scared."

"I have a picture of my father," he said. "I don’t remember him. He was a bicycle repairman once, that’s all I know. But I don’t remember how he moved, or how he laughed, or the sound of his voice." He looked away, then back at Mariam. "My mother said he was the bravest man she knew. Like a lion, she’d say.

But she also said he cried like a child the morning the communists took him. I’m telling you this so you know it’s normal to be scared. There’s nothing to be ashamed of, mother."

For the first time that day, Mariam cried a little.
