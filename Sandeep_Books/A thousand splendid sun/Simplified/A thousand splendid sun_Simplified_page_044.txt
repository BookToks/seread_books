She looked for flour and found it at the back of a cabinet behind some dirty spice jars. Then she made fresh dough, kneading it just like Nana had taught her. She pushed the dough with the heel of her hand, folded the edges, turned it, and pushed it away again. After dusting the dough with flour, she wrapped it in a damp cloth, put on her hijab, and headed out to the community tandoor oven.

Rasheed had told her where to find it—down the street, then a left, and a quick right. But Mariam just followed the group of women and kids going the same way. The kids she saw chasing their moms or running ahead wore shirts with lots of patches. Their pants were either too big or too small, and their sandals had worn-out straps that flapped as they walked. They played by rolling old bike tires with sticks.

The mothers walked in small groups of three or four. Some wore burqas, others didn’t. Mariam could hear their high-pitched talking and their laughter. As she walked with her head down, she caught bits of their talk, which was mostly about sick kids or lazy husbands.

Like the meals just cook themselves.

“Wallah o billah, never a moment’s rest!”

“And he says to me, I swear it’s true, he actually says to me…” This endless chat, sad but kind of happy, went on and on. It went down the street, around the corner, and while waiting in line at the tandoor. Husbands who gambled. Husbands who only cared about their moms and wouldn’t spend a single penny on their wives. Mariam wondered how so many women could be stuck with such horrible men. Or maybe this was some kind of wife’s game she didn’t know about, a daily routine like soaking rice or making dough. Would they expect her to join in soon?

While standing in line at the tandoor, Mariam noticed people looking at her from the side and heard whispers. Her hands started to sweat. She thought they all knew she was born aharami, a shame to her father and his family. They all knew she had betrayed her mother and ruined her own reputation.

She used a corner of her hijab to wipe the sweat above her lip and tried to calm down. For a few minutes, everything went fine. Then someone tapped her on the shoulder. Mariam turned and saw a light-skinned, plump woman wearing a hijab like hers. The woman had short, wiry black hair and a friendly, almost perfectly round face. Her lips were fuller than Mariam’s, and the lower lip drooped a bit, like it was pulled down by a big dark mole just below it. Her big greenish eyes looked at Mariam with a warm sparkle.

“You’re Rasheed jan’s new wife, aren’t you?” the woman said with a big smile.

“The one from Herat.”
