Laila’s favorite thing in the world was lying next to her baby, Aziza. She loved watching Aziza’s big eyes change and running her finger over her soft skin, her little knuckles, and the fat folds on her elbows.

Sometimes, Laila would lay Aziza on her chest and whisper about Tariq, Aziza’s dad who would always be a stranger to her. Aziza would never know his face. Laila told her stories about how smart and tricky he was, and about his easy laugh.

“He had the prettiest lashes, thick like yours. A good chin, a nice nose, and a round forehead. Your dad was handsome, Aziza. Perfect. Perfect, just like you.” But she never said his name out loud.

Sometimes, Rasheed looked at Aziza in a strange way. One night, while he was sitting on the bedroom floor shaving a corn off his foot, he asked, “So what was it like between you two?” Laila looked confused, like she didn’t understand.

“Laili and Majnoon. You and that cripple. What did you have together?” “He was my friend,” she said, trying to keep her voice steady. She started making a bottle. “You know that.” “I don’t know what I know.” Rasheed put the shavings on the windowsill and lay down on the bed. The springs creaked loudly. He spread his legs and picked at his crotch. “And as… friends, did you ever do anything wrong?” “Wrong?” Rasheed smiled like it was a joke, but Laila felt his cold, watchful eyes. “Did he ever kiss you? Maybe touch you where he shouldn’t?” Laila flinched, trying to look angry. Her heart was pounding. “He was like a brother to me.” “So was he a friend or a brother?” “Both. He—” “Which one?” “He was like both.” “Brothers and sisters get curious sometimes. Yes. Sometimes a brother shows his sister his private parts, and a sister…” “You disgust me,” Laila said.

“So there was nothing?” “I don’t want to talk about this anymore.” Rasheed tilted his head, pressed his lips together, and nodded. “People talked, you know. I heard. They said all kinds of things about you two. But you say there was nothing.” Laila stared at him, trying to look angry.

He stared back without blinking for a long time. Her hands tightened around the milk bottle until her knuckles went white. It took all her strength not to break.

She shivered, thinking about what he might do if he found out she had been stealing from him.

Every week since Aziza was born, she had been sneaking into his wallet when he was asleep or outside and taking one bill.
