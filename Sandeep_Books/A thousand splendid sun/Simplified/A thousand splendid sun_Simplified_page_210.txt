He turned around, showing his teeth and angry eyes.

Rasheed and Laila fell to the ground, struggling. He ended up on top, his hands already around Laila’s neck.

Mariam scratched him. She hit his chest. She threw herself at him. She tried to open his fingers from Laila’s neck. She bit them. But his grip stayed tight, and Mariam saw he really wanted to hurt Laila.

He wanted to choke her, and neither of them could stop him.

Mariam stepped back and left the room. She heard a loud noise upstairs, tiny hands hitting a locked door. She ran down the hall. She rushed out the front door and across the yard.

In the toolshed, Mariam grabbed a shovel.

Rasheed didn’t see her come back. He was still on top of Laila, his eyes wide and wild, his hands around her neck. Laila’s face was turning blue, and her eyes rolled back. Mariam saw she wasn’t struggling anymore. He was going to kill her, and Mariam wouldn’t let that happen. He had taken so much from her in 27 years of marriage. She would not let him take Laila too.

Mariam stood firm and held the shovel tightly. She lifted it up.

She said his name because she wanted him to see her.

“Rasheed.” He looked up.

Mariam swung.

She hit him on the side of his head. He fell off Laila.

Rasheed touched his head, looked at the blood on his hand, then at Mariam. She thought she saw his face soften. Maybe he understood something. Maybe he saw how much she had suffered living with him—his cruelty, his anger, and his meanness. Was that respect or regret in his eyes?

But then his lip curled into a mean sneer, and Mariam knew it was useless to stop. If she let him go now, he might get the key from his pocket and get the gun upstairs where Zalmai was locked. If Mariam thought he would only shoot her and maybe spare Laila, she might have dropped the shovel.
