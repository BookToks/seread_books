It’s something common, and you know it. I have friends with two, three, even four wives. Your own dad had three. Also, what I’m doing now, most men I know would have done a long time ago. You know it’s true.” “I won’t allow it.” Rasheed smiled sadly.

“There’s another choice,” he said, scratching his foot with the other. “She can leave. I won’t stop her. But I don’t think she’ll get far. No food, no water, no money, and bullets flying everywhere. How many days do you think she’ll last before someone kidnaps her, hurts her, or kills her? Or maybe all three?” He coughed and fixed the pillow behind his back.

“The roads out there are really dangerous, Mariam, trust me. There are wild dogs and bad people everywhere. I wouldn’t bet on her making it, not at all. But let’s say she somehow gets to Peshawar. What then? Do you know what those camps are like?” He looked at her through a cloud of smoke.

They would kill for this chance. Actually, this is… well, I’d say this is pretty kind of me.” He smiled.

“I think I deserve a medal.” * * * Later, in the dark, Mariam told the girl.

For a long time, the girl didn’t say anything.

“He wants an answer by morning,” Mariam said.

“He can have it now,” the girl said. “My answer is yes.”
