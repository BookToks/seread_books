The fire also burned down the fabric store next door, a secondhand clothing store, a small furniture shop, and a bakery.

Later, they told Rasheed that if the wind had blown east instead of west, his shop at the corner might have been saved.

They sold everything.

First, Mariam's things were sold, then Laila's. Aziza's baby clothes and the few toys Laila had fought Rasheed to buy were sold too. Aziza watched quietly. Rasheed's watch, his old radio, his neckties, shoes, and wedding ring were sold as well. The couch, table, rug, and chairs were sold too. Zalmai threw a bad tantrum when Rasheed sold the TV.

After the fire, Rasheed stayed home almost all the time. He hit Aziza and kicked Mariam.

He threw things around. He blamed Laila for everything – how she smelled, dressed, combed her hair, and even her yellow teeth.

"What’s wrong with you?" he said. "I married someone else, and now I’m stuck with a hag. You’re turning into Mariam." 

He got fired from the kebab place near Haji Yaghoub Square because he fought with a customer. The customer said Rasheed rudely threw bread on his table. They exchanged harsh words. Rasheed called the customer a monkey-faced Uzbek.

A gun was shown, and a skewer was pointed back. Rasheed said he held the skewer, but Mariam wasn’t sure.

He also got fired from a restaurant in Taimani because customers complained about waiting too long. Rasheed said the cook was slow and lazy.

"You were probably napping outside," Laila said.

"Don’t make him angry, Laila," Mariam warned.

"I’m warning you, woman," Rasheed said.

"Maybe it’s because you smoke," Laila said.

"I swear to God. You can’t help being who you are." Then he started hitting Laila, punching her chest, head, and belly, pulling her hair, and throwing her against the wall. Aziza screamed and tried to pull at his shirt; Zalmai screamed too, trying to stop him from hurting his mother. Rasheed pushed the kids away, threw Laila to the ground, and started kicking her. Mariam threw herself on Laila to protect her. He kept kicking, now hitting Mariam too, spitting and glaring with anger, kicking until he couldn’t anymore.

"I swear you’re going to make me kill you, Laila," he said, breathing hard.
