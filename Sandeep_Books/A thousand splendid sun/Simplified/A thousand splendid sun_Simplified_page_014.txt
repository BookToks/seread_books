"Let the girl get an education."  
"Learn? Learn what, Mullah sahib?" Nana said sharply. "What is there to learn?" She looked quickly at Mariam.  

Mariam looked down at her hands.  

"What's the point of sending a girl like you to school? It's like cleaning a dirty cup. You won’t learn anything important there. There is only one skill a woman like us needs, and they don’t teach it in school. Look at me."  
"You shouldn’t talk to her like that, my child," Mullah Faizullah said.  

"Look at me." Mariam did.  

"Only one skill. It’s this: tahamul. Endure."  
"Endure what, Nana?"  
"Oh, don’t worry about that," Nana said. "There will be plenty of things to endure." She told how Mil’s wives called her ugly and lowly because she was a stone carver’s daughter.  

They made her wash clothes outside in the cold until her face went numb and her fingers felt like they were burning.  

"This is our life, Mariam. Women like us have to endure. That’s all we have. Do you get it? And besides, they will laugh at you at school. They will call you harami. They will say terrible things about you. I won’t allow it."  
Mariam nodded.  

"And no more talk about school. You’re all I have. I won’t lose you to them. Look at me. No more talk about school."  
"Be reasonable. Come on. If the girl wants—" Mullah Faizullah started.  

"And you, akhund sahib, with all respect, you should know better than to encourage her silly ideas. If you really care about her, you’ll make her see she belongs here at home with her mother. There’s nothing out there for her. Only rejection and pain. I know, akhund sahib. I know."
