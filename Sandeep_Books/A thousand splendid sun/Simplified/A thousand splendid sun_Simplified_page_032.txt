Mariam's chest felt tight. The room was spinning up and down, and the floor seemed to move under her feet.

"He's a shoemaker," Khadija said now. "But not just any street shoemaker. He has his own shop and lots of important people want shoes from him. He makes shoes for diplomats and the president's family. So, he can take good care of you." Mariam looked at Jalil, her heart jumping in her chest. "Is this true? What she’s saying, is it true?" But Jalil didn’t look at her. He just chewed on his lip and stared at the pitcher.

"He's a bit older than you," Afsoon added. "But not more than... forty. Forty-five at most. Right, Nargis?" "Yes. But I’ve seen nine-year-old girls married to men twenty years older than your suitor, Mariam. We all have. What, you’re fifteen? That’s a good age for a girl to marry." Everyone nodded happily. Mariam noticed they didn’t talk about her half sisters Saideh or Naheed, who were her age and still going to school. Fifteen wasn’t a good age to marry for them.

"Also," Nargis said, "he’s had a big loss. His wife died giving birth ten years ago. And three years ago, his son drowned." "It’s very sad," someone said. "He’s been looking for a wife for years but hasn’t found the right one." "I don’t want to," Mariam said, looking at Jalil. "I don’t want this. Don’t make me." She hated how her voice sounded like she was begging, but she couldn’t help it.

"Now, be reasonable, Mariam," one of the wives said.

Mariam stopped paying attention to who was talking. She kept staring at Jalil, hoping he would say none of this was true.

"You can’t stay here forever." "Don’t you want your own family?" "A home, children of your own?" "You have to move on." "It’s better if you marry a local, a Tajik, but Rasheed is healthy and interested in you."
