"I will, Kakajan," Tariq's voice echoed back.

Laila watched three men far below, talking near a cow tied to a fence. Around them, the trees were changing colors to yellow, orange, and red.

"I miss the boys too, you know," Babi said. His eyes got a little wet. His chin shook. "With your mother, her happiness and sadness are really strong. She can’t hide how she feels. I’m different, I guess. But losing the boys hurt me too. I miss them every day. It’s really hard, Laila. So hard." He rubbed his eyes and tried to speak, but his voice broke. He bit his lip and waited. He took a deep breath and looked at her. "But I’m glad I have you. Every day, I thank God for you. Sometimes, when your mother is having a really bad day, I feel like you’re all I have." Laila moved closer and rested her cheek on his chest. He looked surprised because he didn’t usually show his feelings like Mammy did. He kissed the top of her head and hugged her awkwardly. They stood like that for a while, looking down at the Bamiyan Valley.

"As much as I love this place, some days I think about leaving," Babi said.

"Where would you go?" "Anywhere I could forget. Maybe Pakistan first, for a year or two, while we wait for our papers." "Then what?" "Then, the world is big. Maybe America. Somewhere by the sea, like California." Babi said Americans are kind and would help with money and food until they got settled.

"I would find a job, and after a few years, when we saved enough, we’d open a small Afghan restaurant. Nothing fancy, just a simple place with a few tables and some rugs. Maybe hang pictures of Kabul. We’d let Americans taste Afghan food.

And with your mother’s cooking, they’d be lining up down the street.

"And you would keep going to school, of course. You know how important that is to me.

That would be the most important thing, to get you a good education, high school, then college. But if you wanted, you could help out after school, take orders, fill water pitchers, that kind of thing." Babi said they’d have birthday parties, engagement celebrations, and New Year’s events at the restaurant.
