They stopped two blocks away from the old, barracks-style building.

"Zalmai and I will wait here," Rasheed said. "Oh, before I forget…" He took a stick of gum from his pocket and offered it to Aziza as a small gift. Aziza quietly said thank you. Laila admired how kind and forgiving Aziza was. Her eyes filled with tears. Her heart hurt because she knew Aziza wouldn’t nap next to her this afternoon. She wouldn’t feel Aziza’s light arm on her chest, her head resting against her ribs, her warm breath on her neck, or her heels poking her belly.

When Aziza was taken inside, Zalmai started crying loudly, shouting, "Ziza! Ziza!" He kicked and squirmed in his father’s arms, calling for his sister until he got distracted by a monkey with an organ grinder across the street.

Mariam, Laila, and Aziza walked the last two blocks alone. As they got closer, Laila saw the building was falling apart—the wood was broken, the roof sagged, windows were missing and nailed shut, and there was a swing set behind a crumbling wall.

They stopped by the door, and Laila reminded Aziza of what she had told her before.

"And if they ask about your father, what do you say?" "The Mujahideen killed him," Aziza answered carefully.

"Good. Aziza, do you understand?" "Because this is a special school," Aziza said. Now that they were there, the building felt real, and she looked scared. Her lip shook, and her eyes were about to cry. Laila saw how hard she was trying to be brave. "If we tell the truth," Aziza whispered, "they won’t take me. It’s a special school. I want to go home." "I’ll visit all the time," Laila said. "I promise." "Me too," Mariam said. "We’ll come see you, Aziza jo, and we’ll play just like always. It’s only for a while, until your father finds work." "They have food here," Laila said, her voice shaking. She was glad Aziza couldn’t see how upset she was under her burqa. "You won’t go hungry here. They have rice, bread, water, and maybe even fruit." "But you won’t be here. And Khala Mariam won’t be with me." "I’ll come see you," Laila said.
