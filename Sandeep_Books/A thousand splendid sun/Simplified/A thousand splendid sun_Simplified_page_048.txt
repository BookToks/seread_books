Mariam had never worn a burqa before. Rasheed helped her put it on. The padded headpiece felt tight and heavy on her head, and it was weird to see the world through a mesh screen. She practiced walking around her room but kept stepping on the long edge and tripping. She didn’t like how the cloth pressed against her mouth and how she couldn’t see well from the sides.

"You’ll get used to it," Rasheed said. "Soon, you might even like it." They took a bus to a place Rasheed called Shar-e-Nau Park. Children were playing on swings and hitting volleyballs over nets tied to trees. They walked together, and Mariam kept tripping on the burqa’s edge. For lunch, Rasheed took her to a small kebab restaurant near a mosque he called Haji Yaghoub. The floor was sticky, and the air was smoky. The walls smelled a bit like raw meat, and the music, which Rasheed said was logari, was loud. The cooks were thin boys who fanned the skewers with one hand and shooed away flies with the other. Mariam had never been inside a restaurant before, so it felt strange to sit with so many strangers and lift her burqa to eat. She felt nervous, like she did the day at the tandoor, but Rasheed being there made her feel better. After a while, she didn’t mind the music, smoke, or people. Surprisingly, the burqa felt comforting too. It was like a one-way window. Inside it, she could watch without people seeing her. She didn’t have to worry that anyone could guess her shameful past just by looking at her.

On the streets, Rasheed pointed out buildings like the American Embassy and the Foreign Ministry. He named cars and told Mariam where they were made: Soviet Volgas, American Chevrolets, German Opels.

"Which one do you like best?" he asked. Mariam hesitated and pointed at a Volga. Rasheed laughed. Kabul was much busier than the small part of Herat Mariam had seen. There were fewer trees and fewer horse carts, but more cars, taller buildings, more traffic lights, and paved roads. Everywhere, Mariam heard the city’s special way of speaking: “dear” was “jon” instead of “jo,” and “sister” was “hamshira” instead of “hamshireh.”

Rasheed bought her ice cream from a street vendor. It was the first time she’d ever had ice cream. Mariam couldn’t believe how amazing it tasted. She ate the whole bowl, enjoying the crushed pistachios on top and the tiny rice noodles at the bottom.

She loved the smooth texture and sweet flavor.

They walked to a place called Kocheh Morgha, or Chicken Street. It was a narrow, crowded market in a rich part of Kabul.

“This is where foreign diplomats, rich businessmen, and royal family members live,” Rasheed said. “People like us don’t live here.”

“I don’t see any chickens,” Mariam said.
