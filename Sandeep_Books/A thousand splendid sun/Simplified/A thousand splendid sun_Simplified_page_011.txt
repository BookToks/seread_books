One of Mariam's first memories was hearing the squeaky sound of a wheelbarrow’s iron wheels rolling over rocks. The wheelbarrow came once a month, full of rice, flour, tea, sugar, cooking oil, soap, and toothpaste. Two of Mariam’s half brothers, usually Muhsin and Ramin, sometimes Ramin and Farhad, pushed it. They took turns pushing it up the dirt path, over rocks and pebbles, around holes and bushes until they got to the stream. There, they had to empty the wheelbarrow and carry the stuff by hand across the water. Then they moved the wheelbarrow across and loaded it again.

After that, they pushed it another two hundred yards through tall, thick grass and around bushes. Frogs jumped out of their way. The boys wiped mosquitoes off their sweaty faces.

“He has servants,” Mariam said. “He could send a servant.” “This is his idea of punishment,” Nana said.

The sound of the wheelbarrow made Mariam and Nana go outside. Mariam always remembered Nana on Ration Day: a tall, thin, barefoot woman standing in the doorway, her lazy eye barely open, arms crossed in a tough, mocking way.

Her short hair was messy and uncovered in the sunlight. She wore a gray shirt that didn’t fit well, buttoned all the way up. Her pockets were full of rocks the size of walnuts.

The boys sat by the stream and waited as Mariam and Nana moved the supplies to the house. They knew not to come closer than thirty yards, even though Nana’s aim was bad and most rocks missed. Nana shouted at the boys as she carried rice inside, calling them names Mariam didn’t understand. She cursed their mothers and made angry faces. The boys didn’t answer back.

Mariam felt sorry for the boys. She thought their arms and legs must be so tired from pushing the heavy load. She wished she could give them water but didn’t say anything. If they waved at her, she didn’t wave back. One time, to make Nana happy, Mariam even yelled at Muhsin, saying his mouth looked like a lizard’s butt. Later, she felt really bad and scared they would tell Jalil. But Nana laughed so hard, showing her rotten front tooth, that Mariam thought she might have one of her fits. Nana looked at Mariam and said, “You’re a good daughter.” When the wheelbarrow was empty, the boys played around a bit and then pushed it away. Mariam watched them disappear into the tall grass and flowers.

“Are you coming?”  
“Yes, Nana.”  
“They laugh at you. They do. I hear them.”  
“I’m coming.”  
“You don’t believe me?”  
“Here I am.”
