The thin-faced Talib sitting to the judge's right, not the one giving tea, spoke first. He was the youngest of the three. He talked fast and with proud confidence. He was annoyed that Mariam didn’t speak Pashto. Mariam thought he was the kind of young man who liked to argue, always looking for reasons to punish people, thinking it was his right.

"I do understand," Mariam said.

"I wonder," the young Talib said. "God made men and women different. Our brains are different. You can’t think like we do. Western doctors have proven this. That’s why we only need one male witness but two female ones."

"I admit what I did, brother," Mariam said. "But if I hadn’t, he would have killed her. He was strangling her."

"So you say. But women swear all kinds of things all the time."

"It’s the truth."

"Do you have witnesses? Other than your ambagh?"

"I do not," said Mariam.

"Well, then." He raised his hands and laughed quietly.

The sickly Talib spoke next.

"I have a doctor in Peshawar," he said. "A good young Pakistani man. I saw him a month ago and again last week. I asked him to be honest, and he said three months, maybe six, all God’s will, of course." He nodded at the strong-looking man on his left and took another sip of tea. He wiped his mouth with a shaky hand. "I’m not afraid to leave this life that my only son left five years ago, this life full of sorrow that doesn’t stop. No, I believe I will gladly go when the time comes.

"What scares me, hamshira, is the day God calls me and asks, ‘Why didn’t you follow my laws, Mullah? How will you explain yourself?’ All we can do is follow the laws He gave us while we live. The closer I get to my end, the more I want to obey His word, even if it’s hard." He shifted on his cushion and winced.

"I believe you when you say your husband had a bad temper," he said, looking at Mariam with serious but kind eyes.
