Not you." "That's nice of you to say, Mariam jo." He gave her his Koran. As he had taught her, she kissed it three times, touching it to her forehead each time, then gave it back to him.

"How are you, my girl?" "I’m okay," Mariam started. But then she had to stop because it felt like there was a rock stuck in her throat.

"I keep thinking about what she said to me before I left. She—" "No, no, no." Mullah Faizullah put his hand on her knee. "Your mother, may Allah forgive her, was a sad and unhappy woman, Mariam jo. She did something terrible to herself. To herself, to you, and also to Allah. Allah will forgive her because He is all forgiving, but He is sad about what she did. He does not want anyone to take life, their own or someone else’s, because life is precious. You see—" He moved his chair closer and held Mariam’s hand with both of his. "I knew your mother before you were born, when she was just a little girl, and I can tell you she was unhappy even then. What she did started a long time ago, I’m afraid. What I want to say is that it was not your fault. It wasn’t your fault, my girl." "I shouldn’t have left her. I should have—" "Stop that. Those thoughts are no good, Mariam jo. You hear me, child? No good.

They will hurt you. It wasn’t your fault. It wasn’t your fault. No." Mariam nodded, but even though she wanted to, she couldn’t believe him.

* * * One afternoon, a week later, someone knocked on the door, and a tall woman came in.

She had light skin, red hair, and long fingers.

"I'm Afsoon," she said. "I’m Niloufar’s mother. Why don’t you wash up, Mariam, and come downstairs?" Mariam said she wanted to stay in her room.

"No, you don’t understand. You have to come down. We need to talk to you.

It’s important."
