Barefoot boys ran after cars and buses, waving bags of quinces. Mariam stood on a street corner and watched people passing by, not understanding how they could ignore all the amazing things around them.  

After a while, she got brave enough to ask an old man who owned a horse-drawn carriage if he knew where Jalil, who owned the movie theater, lived. The man had round cheeks and wore a colorful striped coat. "You're not from Herat, are you?" he said kindly.  

"Everyone knows where Jalil Khan lives." "Can you show me?" He unwrapped a toffee and asked, "Are you alone?" "Yes." "Hop on. I’ll take you." "I can’t pay you. I don’t have money." He gave her the toffee. He said he hadn’t had a ride in two hours and was going home anyway. Jalil’s house was on the way.  

Mariam climbed onto the carriage. They rode quietly, side by side. On the way, Mariam saw shops selling herbs, open stalls where people bought oranges, pears, books, shawls, and even falcons. Kids played marbles in circles drawn in the dust.  

Outside tea houses, men sat on carpet-covered wooden platforms, drinking tea and smoking from hookahs.  

The old man turned onto a wide street lined with pine trees. He stopped the horse in the middle of the road.  

"There. Looks like you’re lucky, girl. That’s his car." Mariam jumped down. He smiled and rode away.

Mariam had never touched a car before. She ran her fingers over the hood of Jalil’s car. It was black and shiny, with sparkling wheels where she saw a stretched-out reflection of herself. The seats were white leather. Behind the steering wheel, she saw round glass dials with needles inside.  

For a moment, she heard Nana’s voice in her head, mocking her and killing her hope. With shaky legs, Mariam walked up to the front door of the house. She touched the tall, scary walls. She had to look up to see the tops of cypress trees sticking out over the walls. The trees swayed in the wind, and she imagined they were nodding to welcome her.  

Mariam held herself steady through the waves of sadness she felt.  

A barefoot young woman opened the door.
