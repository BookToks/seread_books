At first, Mariam barely left her room. She woke up early every morning because she heard the azan, a call to prayer, from far away. After that, she went back to bed. One morning, she was still in bed when she heard Rasheed washing up in the bathroom. Then he came into her room to check on her before going to his shop. From her window, she watched him outside, putting his lunch on the back of his bike. Then he walked his bike across the yard to the street. She saw him pedal away until he disappeared around the corner.

Most days, Mariam stayed in bed, feeling lost and sad. Sometimes she went to the kitchen and touched the sticky, greasy counter and the curtains that smelled like burnt food. She looked inside the drawers at the mismatched spoons and knives, the colander, and old wooden spatulas. These were the tools she would use every day now. All of it reminded her that her life had been turned upside down. She felt like she didn’t belong, like she was living someone else’s life.

Back at the kolba, her hunger was normal. But here, she rarely felt hungry.

Sometimes, she took a plate of leftover rice and a piece of bread to the living room by the window. From there, she could see the rooftops of the one-story houses on her street.

She could also see into the yards. Women were hanging laundry and watching their kids. Chickens pecked at the dirt. There were shovels and spades, and cows tied to trees.

She missed the summer nights when she and Nana slept on the flat roof of the kolba, watching the moon over Gul Daman. The nights were so hot their shirts stuck to their chests like wet leaves on a window. She also missed the winter afternoons when she read with Mullah Faizullah. She remembered the sound of icicles falling from the trees and the crows cawing from snow-covered branches.

Alone in the house, Mariam walked around nervously, moving from the kitchen to the living room, up to her room, and back down again. She ended up sitting on her bed, praying and missing her mother. She felt sick and homesick.

When the sun started to set, Mariam’s worry grew stronger. Her teeth chattered thinking about the night, when Rasheed might finally do what husbands usually do to their wives. She lay in bed, very nervous, while he ate alone downstairs.

He always stopped by her room and looked in.

“You can’t be sleeping already. It’s only seven. Are you awake? Answer me. Come on.” He kept pushing until she said, “I’m here.” He sat in the doorway of her room. From her bed, she could see his big body, his long legs, and the smoke swirling around his hooked nose. The tip of his cigarette glowed and dimmed.

He told her about his day.
