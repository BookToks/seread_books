Mariam didn’t hear him. During the whole ride, she cried in the backseat. Her tears were from sadness, anger, and disappointment. But mostly, she felt really ashamed for trusting Jalil so much. She had worried about what dress to wear and her mismatched hijab. She had walked all the way here, refused to leave, and even slept outside like a stray dog.

She was also ashamed because she had ignored how upset her mother looked, with her swollen eyes.

Nana had warned her and had been right all along.

Mariam kept thinking about Jalil’s face in the upstairs window. He had let her sleep on the street. Mariam cried lying down outside. She didn’t want to sit up or be seen. She imagined everyone in Herat knew how badly she had embarrassed herself. She wished Mullah Faizullah was there so she could rest her head on his lap and feel comforted.

After a while, the road got bumpier and the car started going uphill between Herat and Gul Daman.

Mariam wondered what she would say to Nana. How could she say sorry? How could she even face her now?

The car stopped, and the driver helped her out. “I’ll walk with you,” he said.

She let him lead her across the road and up the path. There were honeysuckle and milkweed growing along the way. Bees buzzed over the bright wildflowers. The driver took her hand to help her cross a stream. Then he let go and started talking about the strong winds that would soon blow in Herat every day from midmorning to dusk. He said the sand flies would be everywhere, biting everything.

Suddenly, he stood in front of her, trying to cover her eyes and push her back the way they came. “Go back! No. Don’t look now. Turn around! Go back!” he said.

But he wasn’t fast enough. Mariam saw.

A gust of wind blew and moved the hanging branches of the weeping willow like a curtain. Mariam caught a glimpse of what was under the tree: a straight-backed chair, tipped over. A rope hanging from a high branch. Nana hanging at the end of it.
