"She said yes!" he said, his voice shaking with excitement. "We're leaving, Laila. All three of us. We're leaving Kabul."

In Mammy’s room, they all sat on the bed. Outside, rockets flew through the sky as Hekmatyar’s and Massoud’s armies fought. Laila knew someone somewhere in the city had just died. Black smoke was rising from a building that had fallen apart in dust. In the morning, there would be bodies on the streets. Some would be picked up. Others wouldn’t. Then, Kabul’s dogs, which had started eating people’s flesh, would come and feast.

Still, Laila wanted to run through those streets. She was so happy she could hardly sit still. She had to stop herself from shouting with joy. Babi said they would go to Pakistan first to get visas. Pakistan, where Tariq was! Tariq had only been gone for seventeen days, Laila thought happily. If Mammy had decided seventeen days earlier, they could have left together. She would be with Tariq now! But that didn’t matter. They were going to Peshawar—she, Mammy, and Babi—and they would find Tariq and his parents there. They would sort out their papers together. Then, who knows? Maybe Europe? America? Maybe, as Babi always said, somewhere near the sea...

Mammy was half lying, half sitting against the headboard. Her eyes were red and puffy. She was picking at her hair.

Three days before, Laila had gone outside for fresh air. She stood by the front gates, leaning against them, when she heard a loud crack. Something flew right past her ear, sending tiny wood splinters into the air. After Giti’s death and all the fighting and rockets in Kabul, it was the small bullet hole in the gate, only a few inches from Laila’s head, that woke Mammy up. Made her realize the war had already taken two of her children; this one might take her last one.

From the walls, photos of Ahmad and Noor smiled down. Laila watched Mammy’s eyes move nervously between the pictures, like she was looking for their approval. Like she was asking if it was okay. Like she needed their forgiveness.

“There’s nothing left for us here,” Babi said. “Our sons are gone, but we still have Laila. We still have each other, Fariba. We can start a new life.” Babi reached across the bed. When he leaned to take her hands, Mammy let him. Her face showed she was giving in, accepting it. They held hands gently and then quietly hugged. Mammy buried her face in his neck and grabbed his shirt.

That night, Laila was so excited she couldn’t sleep. She lay in bed watching the sky light up in bright orange and yellow. At some point, even with the noise of the fighting outside, she finally fell asleep.

And she dreamed they were sitting on a blanket on a long beach.
