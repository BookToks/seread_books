One day, while walking by a winding river or looking at fresh snow, he will suddenly realize that his dad’s disappearance isn’t a fresh, painful wound anymore. It has changed into something different—softer and less sharp. It feels like a story or a legend, something to respect and wonder about.

Laila is happy living in Murree. But it’s not an easy kind of happy. It comes with struggles and sacrifices.

* * * On his days off, Tariq takes Laila and the kids to the Mall, where there are shops selling small souvenirs and an old Anglican church built in the 1800s.

Tariq buys them spicy chapli kebabs from street food sellers. They walk through crowds of local people, visiting Europeans with their phones and cameras, and Punjabis who come to escape the hot plains.

Sometimes, they take a bus to Kashmir Point. From there, Tariq shows them the Jhelum River valley, the hills covered with pine trees, and thick forests where monkeys still jump from branch to branch. They also visit Nathia Gali, about thirty kilometers from Murree. Tariq holds Laila’s hand as they walk along a tree-lined road to the Governor’s House. They stop at the old British cemetery or take a taxi up a mountain to see the green, foggy valley below.

Sometimes, when they pass by a store window, Laila sees their reflections. Man, wife, daughter, son. To strangers, she knows, they look like a normal family with no secrets, lies, or regrets.

* * * Azizah has nightmares and wakes up screaming. Laila lies beside her on the cot, wipes her tears with her sleeve, and helps her fall back asleep.

Laila has her own dreams. In them, she’s always back in the house in Kabul, walking through the hall and climbing the stairs.

She’s alone, but behind the doors, she hears the sound of an iron, bed sheets snapping and folding. Sometimes she hears a woman softly humming an old Herati song. But when she opens the door, no one is there.

The dreams shake Laila. She wakes up sweaty and with tears in her eyes. It’s always heartbreaking. Every time it happens, it hurts a lot.
