Mammy started having health problems that stayed with her forever. She had chest pains, headaches, sore joints, night sweats, sharp earaches, and lumps that no one else could feel. Babi took her to a doctor. The doctor did blood and urine tests and took X-rays, but found nothing wrong with her body.

Mammy stayed in bed most days. She wore black clothes. She picked at her hair and bit the mole under her lip. When Mammy was awake, Laila saw her walking unsteadily around the house. Mammy always ended up in Laila’s room, like she hoped to find her brothers there. But they were gone. Only Laila was there, and Mammy seemed to see Laila and the boys as the same.

The only thing Mammy never missed was her five daily prayers. She ended each prayer with her head down and hands raised, quietly asking God to help the Mujahideen win. Laila had to do more and more of the housework.

If Laila didn’t clean, she would find clothes, shoes, open bags of rice, cans of beans, and dirty dishes all over the place. Laila washed Mammy’s dresses and changed her sheets. She helped Mammy get out of bed for baths and meals. She ironed Babi’s shirts and folded his pants. She was also cooking now.

Sometimes, after finishing her chores, Laila would crawl into bed next to Mammy.

She hugged her, held her hands, and buried her face in Mammy’s hair. Mammy would wake a little and say something. She would usually start telling stories about the boys.

One day, while lying like this, Mammy said, “Ahmad was going to be a leader. People three times his age listened to him with respect, Laila. It was amazing. And Noon, my Noor, he always drew buildings and sand bridges. He wanted to be an architect and change Kabul with his designs. Now both are shaheed, my boys, martyrs.” Laila listened, wishing Mammy would notice that she, Laila, was alive, right there in bed, with hopes and a future. But she knew her future didn’t matter compared to her brothers’ past. They were more important in life.

They would even be more important in death. Mammy kept their memories alive, and Laila was just a visitor in their story. Mammy wanted to keep their legends alive.

“The messenger said that when they brought the boys back to camp, Ahmad Shah Massoud himself watched over their burial. He prayed at their graves. That shows how brave your brothers were, Laila, that Commander Massoud, the Lion of Panjshir, God bless him, took care of their burial.” Mammy rolled onto her back.
