The next day, Laila stayed in bed. She was under the blanket in the morning when Rasheed stuck his head in and said he was going to the barber. She was still in bed when he came home late in the afternoon, showing her his new haircut, his new old suit, blue with cream stripes, and the wedding ring he had bought her.

Rasheed sat on the bed next to her, slowly untying the ribbon, opening the box, and carefully taking out the ring. He said he had traded Mariam’s old wedding ring for it.

"She doesn’t care. Trust me. She won’t even notice." Laila moved away to the far end of the bed. She could hear Mariam downstairs, the sound of her iron.

"She never wore it anyway," Rasheed said.

"I don’t want it," Laila said weakly. "Not like this. You have to take it back."

"Take it back?" Rasheed looked annoyed for a moment, then smiled. "I had to add some money too, actually a lot. This is a better ring, 22 karat gold. Feel how heavy it is? Go on, feel it. No?" He closed the box. "How about flowers? That would be nice. Do you like flowers? Daisies? Tulips? Lilacs? No flowers? Good! I don’t get it myself. I just thought… Now, I know a tailor here in Deh Mazang. We could go there tomorrow and get you fitted for a proper dress." Laila shook her head.

Rasheed raised his eyebrows.

"I’d just as soon—" Laila started.

He put a hand on her neck. Laila winced and pulled away. His touch felt rough and uncomfortable.

"Yes?"

"I’d just as soon get it done." Rasheed’s mouth opened, then he smiled a big, yellow grin. "Eager," he said.

Before Abdul Sharif’s visit, Laila had decided to leave for Pakistan. Even after Abdul Sharif came with his news, Laila thought she might still leave. Go somewhere far away from here. Break free from this city where every street corner was a trap, where every alley hid a ghost ready to jump out at her. She might have taken the risk.

But suddenly, leaving was not an option anymore.

Not with this daily throwing up.

This new fullness in her breasts.

And the feeling that she had missed a period.

Laila imagined herself in a refugee camp, a bare field with thousands of plastic sheets tied to poles, flapping in the cold, sharp wind. Under one of these tents, she saw her baby, Tariq’s baby, with sunken temples, slack jaws, and skin that was blotchy and blue-gray.
