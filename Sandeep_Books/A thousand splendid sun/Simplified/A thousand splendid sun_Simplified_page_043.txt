Rasheed had made a pair of loafers just for the deputy foreign minister, who, Rasheed said, only bought shoes from him. A Polish diplomat and his wife also ordered sandals. He told her about some superstitions people had about shoes: like putting shoes on a bed would bring death to the family, or that if you put on the left shoe first, a fight would happen.

"Unless you did it by accident on a Friday," he said. "And did you know it’s bad luck to tie shoes together and hang them on a nail?" Rasheed didn’t believe any of this. He thought superstitions were mostly something women cared about.

He told her things he’d heard on the street, like how the American president Richard Nixon had quit because of a scandal.

Mariam had never heard of Nixon or the scandal. She didn’t say anything back. She waited nervously for Rasheed to finish talking, put out his cigarette, and leave. Only when she heard him cross the hallway and close his door did the tight feeling in her stomach go away. Then one night, instead of leaving, he crushed his cigarette and leaned against the doorway.

"Are you ever going to unpack that thing?" he said, nodding toward her suitcase. He crossed his arms. "I thought you might need time. But this is crazy. It’s been a week and… well, starting tomorrow morning, I want you to act like a wife. Fahmidi? Got it?" Mariam’s teeth started to shake.

"I need an answer." "Yes." "Good," he said. "What did you think? That this is a hotel? That I’m some kind of hotel owner? Well, it… Oh. Oh. La illah u ilillah. What did I say about the crying? Mariam. What did I say about the crying?"

The next morning, after Rasheed left for work, Mariam unpacked her clothes and put them in the dresser. She got a bucket of water from the well and, with a rag, washed her room’s windows and the living room windows downstairs. She swept the floors and brushed away the cobwebs in the corners of the ceiling. She opened the windows to let fresh air in.

She put three cups of lentils to soak in a pot, found a knife, and cut some carrots and a couple of potatoes, leaving them to soak too.
