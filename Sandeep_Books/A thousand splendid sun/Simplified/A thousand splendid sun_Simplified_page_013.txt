Mullah Faizullah told Mariam that sometimes he didn’t understand what the Koran’s words meant. But he said he liked how the Arabic words sounded when he said them. They made him feel calm and peaceful.

“They will comfort you too, Mariam jo,” he said. “You can call on them when you need help, and they won’t let you down. God’s words will never betray you, my girl.” Mullah Faizullah listened carefully when Mariam talked and paid full attention. He nodded slowly and smiled like it was a special gift to hear her. Mariam felt she could tell him things she was too scared to tell Nana.

One day, while they were walking, Mariam said she wished she could go to school.

“I mean a real school, akhund sahib. Like in a classroom. Like my father’s other kids.” Mullah Faizullah stopped walking.

The week before, Bibi jo had told her that Jalil’s daughters, Saideh and Naheed, were going to the Mehri School for girls in Herat. Since then, Mariam kept thinking about classrooms, teachers, notebooks with lines, rows of numbers, and pens that made dark marks. She imagined sitting with other girls her age and drawing important lines with a ruler.

“Is that what you want?” Mullah Faizullah asked, looking at her with kind, watery eyes. His hands were behind his back, and his turban shadow fell on some buttercups.

“Yes.” “And you want me to ask your mother if you can go.” Mariam smiled. She felt like no one understood her better than her old tutor, except for Jalil.

“Then what can I do? God, in His wisdom, has given us all weaknesses. Mine is that I can’t say no to you, Mariam jo,” he said, tapping her cheek with his sore finger.

But later, when he spoke to Nana about it, she dropped the knife she was using to cut onions. “What for?” she asked. “If the girl wants to learn, let her, my dear.”
