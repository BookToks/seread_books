Laila Tariq said that one of the men who shared his cell had a cousin who got whipped once for painting flamingos. The cousin really loved flamingos and couldn’t stop painting them.

“Whole sketchbooks,” Tariq said. “Dozens of oil paintings of flamingos wading in water, sunbathing in marshes, even flying into sunsets.” “Flamingos,” Laila said. She looked at him sitting against the wall, his good leg bent. She wanted to touch him again, like she did earlier by the front gate when she ran to him. She felt embarrassed now thinking about how she had thrown her arms around his neck and cried on his chest, saying his name over and over with a thick voice.

Had she been too eager, too desperate? Maybe. But she couldn’t help it. Now she wanted to touch him again to prove he was really here, not a dream.

“Yeah,” he said. “Flamingos.” When the Taliban found the paintings, Tariq said, they got mad at the birds’ long, bare legs. They tied the cousin’s feet and whipped his feet until they bled. Then they gave him a choice: destroy the paintings or make the flamingos decent. So the cousin painted pants on every bird. “And there you have it. Islamic flamingos,” Tariq said.

They laughed, but Laila stopped herself. She felt ashamed of her yellow teeth and missing tooth. She felt ugly and wished she could wash her face or comb her hair.

“But the cousin will have the last laugh,” Tariq said. “He painted those pants with watercolors. When the Taliban are gone, he’ll just wash them off.” He smiled. Laila saw he had a missing tooth too and looked at his hands. “Yeah.” He wore a pakol hat, hiking boots, and a black sweater tucked into khaki pants. He half-smiled and nodded slowly. Laila hadn’t seen him act like this before. This serious word “indeed,” the thoughtful hand gesture, the slow nod—it was new. Such a grown-up way to act. But why was it so surprising? He was an adult now—twenty-five years old, moving slowly, tired smile.

He was tall and bearded, slimmer than she remembered, but his hands looked strong, like a worker’s. His face was still handsome but no longer fair-skinned. His forehead looked weathered and sunburned, like someone who had traveled a long, hard journey.

His pakol hat was pushed back, showing he was starting to lose hair.

The hazel color of his eyes looked duller than she remembered, paler, or maybe it was just the light.

Laila thought of Tariq’s mother, her calm manners, clever smiles, and purple wig.
