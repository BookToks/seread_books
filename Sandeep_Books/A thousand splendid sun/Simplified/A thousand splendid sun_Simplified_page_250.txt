On the sign, Zaman has painted four lines of poetry with a brush. Laila knows these are his answer to people who complain that the promised aid money to Afghanistan isn’t coming, that rebuilding is too slow, that there is corruption, that the Taliban are getting stronger and will come back angrily, and that the world will forget about Afghanistan again.

The lines are from his favorite poem by Hafez: Joseph will return to Canaan, don’t be sad. Old homes will become rose gardens, don’t be sad. If a flood comes to drown everything, Noah will guide you through the storm, don’t be sad.

Laila walks under the sign and goes into the classroom. The children are sitting down, opening their notebooks, and talking. Aziza is chatting with a girl nearby. A paper airplane flies across the room and someone throws it back.

“Open your Farsi books, children,” Laila says, putting her own books on her desk.

As the pages flip, Laila walks to the window without curtains. Outside, she sees boys lining up to practice basketball free throws.

Above them, the sun is rising over the mountains. It shines on the metal basketball hoop, the tire swings, the whistle around Zaman’s neck, and his new glasses. Laila presses her hands against the warm glass.

She closes her eyes and feels the sunlight on her face.

When they first returned to Kabul, Laila was sad because she didn’t know where the Taliban had buried Mariam. She wanted to visit Mariam’s grave, sit there, and leave flowers. But now Laila knows it doesn’t matter. Mariam is still close by—in the walls they repainted, the trees they planted, the blankets that keep the children warm, the pillows, books, and pencils. She is in the children’s laughter, in the poems Aziza recites, and in the prayers she says when she bows west. But mostly, Mariam is in Laila’s heart, shining bright like a thousand suns.

Suddenly, someone is calling her name. Laila turns and tilts her head a little to hear better. It’s Aziza.

“Mammy? Are you okay?” The room is quiet. The children are watching her.

Laila is about to answer when she suddenly feels a strange wave inside her. Her hands go down and touch the spot where she felt it. She waits, but nothing else happens.

“Mammy?” “Yes, my love.” Laila smiles. “I’m okay. Yes, very much.” As she walks to her desk at the front, Laila thinks about the naming game they played again at dinner last night.
