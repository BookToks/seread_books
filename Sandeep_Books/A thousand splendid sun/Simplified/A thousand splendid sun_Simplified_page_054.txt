She saw a pack of cigarettes on the dresser next to his bed. She put one in her mouth and stood in front of the small oval mirror on the wall. She blew smoke at the mirror and tapped the ash. Then she put the cigarette back. She could never smoke as smoothly as Kabuli women did. It looked rough and silly on her.

Feeling guilty, she opened the top drawer of his dresser.

The first thing she saw was a gun. It was black, with a wooden handle and a short barrel. Mariam made sure to remember which way it was pointing before she picked it up. She turned it over in her hands. It was heavier than it looked. The handle felt smooth, and the barrel was cold. It upset her that Rasheed owned something made just to kill people. But maybe he kept it to protect them. To protect her.

Under the gun were some magazines with curled corners. Mariam opened one.

Something inside her sank. Her mouth opened without her meaning to.

Every page showed women, beautiful women, wearing no shirts, no pants, no socks or underwear. They wore nothing at all. They lay in beds with messy sheets and looked at Mariam with tired eyes. Most pictures showed their legs spread apart, and Mariam could see everything between. In some, the women were bowed down like they were praying, but their faces looked bored and annoyed.

Mariam quickly put the magazine back where she found it. She felt dizzy. Who were these women? How could they let themselves be photographed like this? Her stomach turned with disgust. Was this what Rasheed did on the nights he didn’t come to her room? Had she been a disappointment to him in that way? And what about all his talk about honor and being proper, and how he didn’t like the women customers who only showed him their feet to get shoes? He said a woman’s face belongs only to her husband. But the women in these pictures must have husbands or brothers. So why did Rasheed want her to cover up when he looked at other women’s private parts?

Mariam sat on his bed, feeling embarrassed and confused. She held her face in her hands and closed her eyes. She took deep breaths until she felt calmer.

Slowly, she thought she understood. He was a man, after all, who had lived alone for years before she came. His needs were different from hers. For her, sex was still painful even after many months. But for him, his desire was strong, almost violent. The way he held her down, squeezed her breasts hard, and moved so fast. He was a man. He hadn’t been with a woman for a long time.

Could she blame him for being the way God made him?

Mariam knew she could never talk to him about this. It was something you just didn’t say. But was it unforgivable? She only had to think about the other man in her life. Jalil, who had three wives and nine kids but still was with Nana before they were married. Which was worse, Rasheed’s magazines or what Jalil did?
