She remembered Babi, looking pale, slumped on the couch, and Mammy, covering her mouth when she heard the news. Laila had seen Mammy break down that day, and it had scared her, but she didn’t really feel sad. She didn’t understand how terrible it was for her mother to lose someone.

Now, a stranger had come with news of another death. Now she was the one sitting in the chair. Was this her punishment for not caring about her mother’s pain?

Laila remembered how Mammy had fallen to the ground, screaming and pulling at her hair. But Laila couldn’t do that. She could barely move.

She sat in the chair instead, her hands loose in her lap, her eyes staring at nothing, and let her mind wander. She let it go until it found a safe, happy place where the barley fields were green, the water was clear, and cottonwood seeds floated in the air.

In that place, Babi was reading under a tree, Tariq was napping with his hands crossed on his chest, and she could dip her feet in the stream and dream good dreams while ancient gods watched over her from sun-bleached rocks.
