I want to meet them. I want us all to go together. That's what I want." Jalil sighed. He was looking away, toward the mountains.

Mariam remembered him saying that on the screen a human face looked as big as a house, and when a car crashed up there, you could feel the metal twisting inside you. She imagined herself sitting in the special balcony seats, eating ice cream with her siblings and Jalil. "That's what I want," she said.

Jalil looked at her sadly.

"Tomorrow. At noon. I'll meet you right here. Okay? Tomorrow?" "Come here," he said. He crouched down, pulled her close, and held her for a long time.

At first, Nana walked around the kolba, clenching and unclenching her fists.

"Of all the daughters I could have had, why did God give me an ungrateful one like you?

Everything I went through for you! How dare you! How dare you leave me like this, you terrible little harami!" Then she made fun of her.

"What a stupid girl you are! You think you matter to him, that he wants you in his house?

You think you're his daughter? That he'll take you in? Let me tell you something. A man's heart is a cruel, cruel thing, Mariam. It’s not like a mother’s womb. It won’t bleed or stretch to make room for you. I’m the only one who loves you. I’m all you have in this world, Mariam, and when I’m gone, you’ll have nothing. You’ll have nothing. You are nothing!" Then she tried to make her feel guilty.

"I’ll die if you go. The jinn will come, and I’ll have one of my fits. You’ll see, I’ll swallow my tongue and die. Don’t leave me, Mariam jo. Please stay. I’ll die if you go." Mariam said nothing.

"You know I love you, Mariam jo." Mariam said she was going for a walk.

She was scared she might say mean things if she stayed: that she knew the jinn was fake, that Jalil had told her Nana’s problem was a disease with a name and pills could help. She might have asked Nana why she didn’t want to see Jalil’s doctors, as he told her to, or why she wouldn’t take the pills he bought for her.
