On the bus ride home from the doctor, something really strange was happening to Mariam.

Everywhere she looked, she saw bright colors: on the dull, gray apartments, on the tin-roofed stores, and in the muddy water in the gutters. It was like a rainbow had melted into her eyes.

Rasheed was tapping his gloved fingers and humming a song. Every time the bus hit a bump and jerked forward, his hand quickly went over her belly.

"What about Zalmai?" he said. "It's a good Pashtun name." "What if it's a girl?" Mariam asked.

"I think it's a boy. Yes. A boy." People on the bus were whispering and pointing at something outside.

"Look," said Rasheed, tapping the glass with his knuckle. He was smiling. "There. See?" On the street, Mariam saw people stopping to look. At traffic lights, faces came out of car windows, all watching the soft snow falling. Mariam wondered why the first snow of the season was so special. Was it because it was clean and untouched? Like a fresh start before everything got messy?

"If it's a girl," Rasheed said, "and it isn’t, but if it is, then you can pick any name you want."

The next morning, Mariam woke up to the sounds of sawing and hammering. She wrapped a shawl around herself and went outside into the snowy yard. The heavy snow from last night had stopped. Now only a few light flakes brushed her cheeks. The air was still and smelled like burning coal. Kabul was quiet, covered in white snow, with smoke rising here and there.

She found Rasheed in the toolshed, hammering nails into a piece of wood. When he saw her, he took a nail out of his mouth.

"It was supposed to be a surprise. The baby will need a crib. You weren’t meant to see it until it was finished." Mariam wished he wouldn’t act like it had to be a boy. Even though she was happy about the pregnancy, his hope made her feel uneasy. Yesterday, Rasheed had come home with a suede winter coat for a boy, lined with soft sheepskin, and sleeves decorated with red and yellow silk thread.

Rasheed lifted a long, narrow board.
