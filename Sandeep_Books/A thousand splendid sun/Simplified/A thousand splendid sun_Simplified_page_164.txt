Mariam SEPTEMBER 1996

Two and a half years later, Mariam woke up on the morning of September 27 to loud shouting, whistling, firecrackers, and music. She ran to the living room and saw Laila already at the window with Aziza sitting on her shoulders. Laila turned and smiled.

"The Taliban are here," she said.

Mariam first heard about the Taliban two years earlier, in October 1994. Rasheed had told her they had taken over the city of Kandahar by defeating the warlords. He said they were a group of young Pashtun men whose families had run away to Pakistan during the war with the Soviets. Most of these boys grew up in refugee camps on the Pakistan border and went to religious schools there. Their leader was a secretive, one-eyed man named Mullah Omar, who called himself the "Leader of the Faithful."

"They don’t have roots here," Rasheed said, not really talking to Mariam or Laila. Since their failed escape two and a half years ago, Mariam knew Rasheed saw her and Laila as the same—both worthless and not to be trusted. When he spoke, it felt like he was talking to himself or someone invisible, someone he respected more than them.

"They may not know much about the world or this country’s history," he said, smoking and looking at the ceiling. "Compared to them, Mariam might as well be a university professor. But look around. What do you see? Corrupt, greedy commanders fighting and killing everyone. At least the Taliban are pure and honest. They’re decent Muslim boys. When they come, they will fix things. People won’t get shot just for going out. No more rockets! Think about it." 

For two years, the Taliban had been moving toward Kabul, taking cities from the warlords and ending fighting where they settled. They captured a commander named Abdul Ali Mazari and killed him. For months, they stayed in the southern edge of Kabul, firing rockets and fighting with another commander, Ahmad Shah Massoud. Earlier that September, they took the cities of Jalalabad and Sarobi.

The Taliban had something the warlords didn’t, Rasheed said. They were united.

"Let them come," he said. "I will welcome them with rose petals."

That day, the four of them went out, with Rasheed leading them from one bus to another, to meet their new world and new leaders.
