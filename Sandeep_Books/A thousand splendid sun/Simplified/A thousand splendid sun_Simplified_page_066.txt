Near her bed, the old midwife, Wajma, watched as Fariba’s husband and sons passed around the baby. They admired the baby’s light hair, pink cheeks, small rosebud lips, and green eyes barely open.

Ahmad, the most religious in the family, said the azan in her ear and blew on her face three times.

"Laila it is, then?" Hakim asked, bouncing his daughter.

"Laila it is," Fariba said with a tired smile. "Night Beauty. It’s perfect."

"What’s wrong?" Mariam asked, hating how sorry she sounded. She felt her heart beat faster and her skin tighten.

"What’s wrong?"
