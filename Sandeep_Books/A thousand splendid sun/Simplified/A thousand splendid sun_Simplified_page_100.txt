"They'll keep the war going through him, you can bet on that." Someone in the next aisle agreed.

Mammy was quietly praying to herself, saying long prayers that went on and on until she ran out of breath and had to finish with a tiny, high-pitched squeak.

Later that day, Laila and Tariq went to Cinema Park and had to watch a Soviet movie dubbed in Farsi, which ended up being unintentionally funny. The story was about a merchant ship and a first mate who was in love with the captain's daughter, Alyona. Then a big storm hit with lightning, rain, and the ship tossing around. One sailor yelled something, and the calm Afghan voice translated it as, "My dear sir, would you kindly pass the rope?" Tariq burst out laughing, and soon they were both laughing so hard they couldn’t stop. A man a few rows ahead turned around and told them to be quiet.

Near the end, there was a wedding scene. The captain had finally allowed Alyona to marry the first mate. The newlyweds were smiling and everyone was drinking vodka.

"I'm never getting married," Tariq whispered.

"Me neither," Laila said, but she hesitated for a moment, worried her voice might have shown she was disappointed. Then she added more firmly, "Never. Weddings are stupid. All the fuss. All the money spent. For what? For clothes you’ll never wear again. Ha!"

"If I ever do get married," Tariq said, "they’d have to make room for three on the wedding stage. Me, the bride, and the guy holding a gun to my head." The man in the front row gave them another warning look.

On the screen, Alyona and her new husband kissed.

Watching the kiss, Laila suddenly felt very self-conscious. She noticed her heart beating fast, the sound of blood in her ears, and how still Tariq had become next to her. The kiss lasted a long time. Laila felt it was really important not to move or make a sound. She felt that Tariq was watching her, one eye on the kiss and the other on her. She wondered if he could hear her breathing, waiting for her to slip up and show what she was really thinking.
