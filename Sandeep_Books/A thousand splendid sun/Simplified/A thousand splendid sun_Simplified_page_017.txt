"Are you listening?"  
"I am."  

He saw her looking at the bulge in his coat's side pocket.  
"Ah. Of course. Well. Here, then."  

Without waiting, he pulled a small box from his pocket and gave it to her. He sometimes brought her little gifts. One time, a carnelian bracelet cuff, another time, a choker with lapis lazuli beads. That day, Mariam opened the box and found a leaf-shaped pendant with tiny coins carved with moons and stars hanging from it.  

"Try it on, Mariam jo."  
She did.  
"What do you think?"  
Jalil smiled proudly.  
"I think you look like a queen."  

After he left, Nana saw the pendant on Mariam's neck.  
"Nomad jewelry," she said. "I've seen them make it. They melt the coins people throw at them and turn them into jewelry. Let's see him bring you gold next time, your precious father. Let's see him."  

When it was time for Jalil to leave, Mariam always stood in the doorway and watched him walk away, feeling sad about the long week before she would see him again. She held her breath as she watched him go and counted in her head. She imagined that every second she didn’t breathe, God would give her another day with Jalil.  

At night, Mariam lay in her bed and thought about his house in Herat. She wondered what it would be like to live with him and see him every day. She imagined handing him a towel while he shaved, warning him if he cut himself. She would make tea for him. She would sew on his missing buttons. They would take walks together in Herat’s covered market where Jalil said you could find anything you wanted. They would ride in his car, and people would point and say, "There goes Jalil Khan with his daughter." He would show her the famous tree where a poet was buried.  

One day soon, Mariam decided, she would tell Jalil all these things. When he heard her and saw how much she missed him, he would surely take her with him. He would bring her to Herat to live in his house, just like his other children.
