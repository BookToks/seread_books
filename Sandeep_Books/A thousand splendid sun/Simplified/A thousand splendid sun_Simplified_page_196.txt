Rasheed's eyebrows went up when the seller told him the price. They argued a bit, and in the end, Rasheed said to Aziza, like she had caused the problem, "Give it back. I can't pay for both." On the way back, Aziza stopped acting cheerful the closer they got to the orphanage.

Her hands stopped moving up. Her face looked sad. This happened every time. Now it was Laila's turn, with Mariam helping, to start talking, to laugh nervously, and to fill the quiet with silly, nervous chatter. Later, after Rasheed dropped them off and took the bus to work, Laila watched Aziza wave goodbye and walk slowly along the wall in the orphanage yard. She thought about Aziza's stutter and what Aziza had said earlier about hidden breaks and strong hits inside us, and how sometimes all we see on the outside is a small shake.

"Go away, you!" Zalmai shouted.

"Be quiet," Mariam said. "Who are you yelling at?" He pointed. "There. That man." Laila looked where he pointed. A man was standing by the front door, leaning on it. He turned his head when he saw them coming. He uncrossed his arms and limped a few steps toward them.

Laila stopped.

She felt a lump in her throat. Her knees felt weak. Laila suddenly wanted to grab Mariam’s arm, shoulder, or wrist, something to hold on to. But she didn’t. She didn’t dare. She didn’t dare move at all. She didn’t even breathe or blink, afraid he might be just a trick, something that would disappear if she moved. Laila stood very still and looked at Tariq until she really needed to breathe and her eyes wanted to blink. Then, amazingly, after she took a breath and opened her eyes, he was still there. Tariq was still there.

Laila let herself take one step toward him. Then another. And another. Then she started running.
