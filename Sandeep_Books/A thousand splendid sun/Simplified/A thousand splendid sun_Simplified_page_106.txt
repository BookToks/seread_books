Mammy said, "That's settled then. Now, where is Hakim? Where is my sweet husband?" 

It was a bright, clear day, perfect for a party. The men sat on old folding chairs in the yard. They drank tea, smoked, and talked loudly about the Mujahideen's plan. From Babi, Laila had learned the basics: Afghanistan was now called the Islamic State of Afghanistan. An Islamic Jihad Council, made in Peshawar by some Mujahideen groups, would be in charge for two months, led by Sibghatullah Mojadidi. After that, a leadership council led by Rabbani would take over for four months. During those six months, a big council called a loya jirga would happen. This council of leaders and elders would create a temporary government to rule for two years until democratic elections could happen.

One man was fanning lamb skewers cooking on a simple grill. Babi and Tariq's father were playing chess in the shade of an old pear tree. They looked very focused. Tariq sat near the board, watching the game and listening to the political talk nearby.

The women gathered inside the house—in the living room, hallway, and kitchen. They talked while holding their babies and carefully moved to avoid the kids running around. Music from Ustad Sarahang played loudly from a cassette player.

Laila was in the kitchen, making dogh drinks with Giti. Giti wasn’t shy or serious like before. For months, her angry frown had disappeared. She laughed a lot now, sometimes in a playful way that surprised Laila. She stopped wearing dull ponytails, let her hair grow, and added red highlights. Laila soon learned why—Giti liked an eighteen-year-old boy named Sabir, who was the goalkeeper on her older brother’s soccer team.

"Oh, he has the most handsome smile and thick black hair!" Giti told Laila.

No one knew about their feelings. Giti had secretly met Sabir twice for tea, each time for just fifteen minutes, at a small teahouse in Taimani, across town.

"He's going to ask to marry me, Laila! Maybe as soon as this summer. Can you believe it? I can't stop thinking about him." 

"What about school?" Laila asked. Giti just tilted her head and gave her a "We both know better" look.

By the time we're twenty, Hasina used to say, Giti and I will each have four or five kids. But you, Laila, you’ll make your parents proud. You’re going to be someone special. I know one day I’ll see your picture on the front page of a newspaper.

Giti was now beside Laila, chopping cucumbers, with a dreamy look on her face.
