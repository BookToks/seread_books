But in the end, her curiosity is too strong.

She slides the key in. After some rattling and shaking, she opens the box.

Inside, she finds three things: an envelope, a burlap sack, and a videocassette.

Laila takes the tape and goes down to the reception desk. The old clerk who greeted them the day before tells her the hotel has only one VCR, and it’s in the biggest suite.

The suite is empty right now, and he agrees to take her there. He leaves the desk to a young man with a mustache who is talking on a cell phone.

The old clerk leads Laila to the second floor, to a door at the end of a long hallway. He unlocks it and lets her in.

Laila’s eyes find the TV in the corner. She doesn’t notice anything else about the suite. She turns on the TV and the VCR. She puts the tape in and presses play. The screen is blank for a few moments, and Laila starts to wonder why Jalil gave Mariam a blank tape. Then music starts, and pictures begin to play on the screen.

Laila frowns. She watches for a minute or two. Then she presses stop, fast forwards the tape, and presses play again. It’s the same movie.

The old man looks at her, confused.

The movie playing is Walt Disney’s Pinocchio. Laila doesn’t understand.

Tariq and the kids come back to the hotel just after six o’clock. Aziza runs to Laila and shows her the earrings Tariq bought for her—silver with a little butterfly on each. Zalmai is holding an inflatable dolphin that squeaks when you squeeze its nose.

“How are you?” Tariq asks, putting his arm around her shoulder.

“I’m fine,” Laila says. “I’ll tell you later.” They walk to a nearby kebab place to eat. It’s small, with sticky tablecloths, smoky and loud. But the lamb is tender and juicy and the bread is warm. After they eat, they walk around the streets for a while. Tariq buys the kids rosewater ice cream from a street vendor. They sit on a bench to eat, with mountains behind them dark against the red sky at sunset. The air is warm and smells like cedar.

Laila opened the envelope earlier when she came back to the room after watching the tape. Inside was a letter, handwritten in blue ink on yellow lined paper.

It read: 244 A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS May 13, 1987 My dear Mariam: I hope this letter finds you well. As you know, I came to Kabul a month ago to talk with you.
