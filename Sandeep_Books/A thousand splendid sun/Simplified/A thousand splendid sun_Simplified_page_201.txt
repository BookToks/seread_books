He saw skinny boys carrying water in their cans, picking up dog poop to make fire, carving toy guns from wood with dull knives, and carrying heavy sacks of wheat flour that no one could use to make bread because it was stuck together. All around the refugee camp, the wind made the tents flap. It blew weed bits everywhere and lifted kites flown from the roofs of mud houses.

"A lot of kids died. Dysentery, TB, hunger—you name it. Mostly, that awful dysentery. God, Laila. I saw so many kids buried. There's nothing worse a person can see." He crossed his legs. It got quiet again between them for a while.

"My father didn't survive that first winter," he said. "He died in his sleep. I don't think there was any pain." That same winter, he said, his mother got pneumonia and almost died. She would have died if not for a camp doctor who worked out of a station wagon turned into a mobile clinic. She would wake up all night, feverish, coughing up thick, rust-colored spit. The lines to see the doctor were long, Tariq said. Everyone was shaking in line, moaning, coughing, some with poop running down their legs, others too tired, hungry, or sick to talk.

"But he was a good man, the doctor. He treated my mother, gave her some medicine, and saved her life that winter." That same winter, Tariq cornered a kid.

"Twelve, maybe thirteen years old," he said calmly. "I held a piece of glass to his throat and took his blanket. I gave it to my mother." After his mother's sickness, Tariq promised himself they would not spend another winter in the camp. He would work, save money, and move them to an apartment in Peshawar with heat and clean water. When spring came, he looked for work. Sometimes a truck came early in the morning and picked up a few dozen boys, taking them to a field to move stones or an orchard to pick apples for a little money, sometimes a blanket or shoes. But they never wanted him, Tariq said.

"One look at my leg and it was over." There were other jobs too. Digging ditches, building huts, carrying water, cleaning out outhouses. But young men fought over these jobs, and Tariq never had a chance. Then, one day in the fall of 1993, he met a shopkeeper.

"He offered me money to take a leather coat to Lahore. Not much, but enough—enough for maybe one or two months' rent for an apartment."
