It was the hottest day of the year. The mountains held in the burning heat, making the city feel stuffy like smoke. The power had been out for days. All over Kabul, electric fans sat still, almost like they were teasing everyone.

Laila lay on the living room couch, sweating through her blouse. Every time she breathed out, it felt like fire on her nose. She could hear her parents talking in Mammy’s room.

Two nights ago, and again last night, she thought she heard their voices downstairs. They talked every day now, ever since the bullet hit, ever since the new hole appeared in the gate.

Outside, there was a far-off boom of artillery, then closer, a stuttering sound of gunfire, one after another.

Inside, Laila was fighting a battle too: guilt and shame on one side, and on the other, the belief that what she and Tariq did wasn’t wrong; it was natural, good, beautiful, and maybe even meant to be, since they might never see each other again.

Laila turned to her side on the couch and tried to remember something: When they were on the floor, Tariq had put his forehead against hers. Then he whispered something, maybe “Am I hurting you?” or “Is this hurting you?”

She couldn’t remember which.

“Am I hurting you?”

“Is this hurting you?”

It had only been two weeks since he left, but already the sharp memories were fading. Laila focused hard. What had he said? It felt really important to know.

She closed her eyes and tried to remember.

Over time, she would get tired of trying to remember. It would get harder and harder to bring back what felt dead inside her. One day, years later, Laila wouldn’t miss him as much. The details of his face would start to fade. Hearing a mother call her child "Tariq" on the street wouldn’t hurt her so much. She wouldn’t feel the pain of missing him all the time, like a phantom limb hurting after an amputation.

But sometimes, when Laila was a grown woman, doing small things like ironing a shirt or pushing her kids on a swing, something small — like the warm feeling of a carpet on a hot day or the shape of a stranger’s forehead — would suddenly bring back the memory of that afternoon with him. It would all come rushing back. How spontaneous they were. How reckless. How awkward. The pain and pleasure and sadness of it all. The heat of their bodies tangled together.

It would flood her, making it hard to breathe.

But then the feeling would fade. The moment would pass. She would feel empty and a little restless.

She decided he had said, “Am I hurting you?” Yes. That was it. Laila felt happy she remembered.

Then Babi called her name from the hallway at the top of the stairs, telling her to come up quickly.
