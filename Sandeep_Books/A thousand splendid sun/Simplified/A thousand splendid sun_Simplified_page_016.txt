When she laughed, she covered her mouth with her fist to hide her bad tooth.

Nana asked about his businesses and his wives too. When she told him she had heard from Bibi jo that his youngest wife, Nargis, was going to have her third baby, Jalil smiled politely and nodded.

"Well. You must be happy," Nana said. "How many kids do you have now? Ten, right? Mashallah? Ten?" Jalil said yes, ten.

"Eleven, if you count Mariam, of course." Later, after Jalil went home, Mariam and Nana had a small argument about this. Mariam said she had tricked him.

After tea with Nana, Mariam and Jalil always went fishing in the stream. He showed her how to cast her fishing line and how to reel in the trout. He taught her how to clean a trout, gut it, and lift the meat off the bone in one move. He drew pictures for her while they waited for a fish to bite, and showed her how to draw an elephant in one line without lifting the pen. He taught her rhymes. Together they sang: Lili lili birdbath, Sitting on a dirt path, Minnow sat on the rim and drank, Slipped, and in the water she sank.

Jalil brought clippings from Herat’s newspaper, Iiiifaq-i Islam, and read them to her.

He was Mariam’s connection to the outside world, proof that there was a big world beyond the kolba, beyond Gul Daman and Herat too. A world with presidents whose names were hard to say, trains, museums, soccer, rockets that orbited the earth and landed on the moon. Every Thursday, Jalil brought a piece of that world to the kolba.

He was the one who told her in the summer of 1973, when Mariam was fourteen, that King Zahir Shah, who had ruled Kabul for forty years, had been overthrown without violence.

"His cousin Daoud Khan did it while the king was in Italy for medical treatment. You remember Daoud Khan, right? I told you about him. He was prime minister in Kabul when you were born. Anyway, Afghanistan is no longer a monarchy, Mariam. It’s a republic now, and Daoud Khan is the president. There are rumors that the socialists in Kabul helped him take power. Not that he’s a socialist himself, but that they helped him. That’s the rumor anyway." Mariam asked what a socialist was, and Jalil started to explain, but Mariam barely heard him.
