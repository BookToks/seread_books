Mariam was five years old the first time she heard the word harami.

It happened on a Thursday. It must have been Thursday because Mariam remembered feeling restless and distracted that day, just like she always did on Thursdays, the day when Jalil came to see her at the kolba. To pass the time until she could finally see him walking through the tall grass and waving, Mariam climbed onto a chair and took down her mother’s Chinese tea set. The tea set was the only thing Mariam’s mother, Nana, had from her own mother, who died when Nana was two. Nana loved every piece of the blue-and-white porcelain, the smooth shape of the teapot’s spout, the painted birds and flowers, and the dragon on the sugar bowl that was supposed to keep bad luck away.

That last piece slipped from Mariam’s hands, fell onto the wooden floor, and broke into pieces.

When Nana saw the broken bowl, her face turned red, her lip trembled, and her eyes, both the lazy one and the good one, stared at Mariam without blinking. Nana looked so angry that Mariam was scared the jinn, a kind of evil spirit, would take over her mother’s body again. But the jinn didn’t come this time. Instead, Nana grabbed Mariam’s wrists, pulled her close, and through clenched teeth said, “You are a clumsy little harami. This is my reward for everything I’ve been through. An heirloom-breaking, clumsy little harami.” Mariam didn’t understand the word harami—bastard—at first. She was too young to see how unfair it was, or that the real blame was on the people who made someone a harami, not on the harami themselves, who only did wrong by being born.

Mariam guessed from the way Nana said the word that being a harami was a horrible thing, like being a bug or one of the cockroaches Nana hated and always tried to get rid of.

Later, when she was older, Mariam understood. It wasn’t just the word itself but how Nana said it, almost like spitting it out, that hurt the most. She realized Nana meant that a harami was unwanted; that Mariam, being one, was someone who would never have the same rights as others—things like love, family, a home, and acceptance.

Jalil never called Mariam that name. He called her his little flower. He liked sitting her on his lap and telling her stories, like how Herat, the city where Mariam was born in 1959, used to be a center of Persian culture, full of writers, painters, and Sufis.

“You couldn’t stretch out your leg here without poking a poet in the butt,” he laughed.

Jalil also told her the story of Queen Gauhar Shad, who built the famous minarets as a loving gift to Herat back in the fifteenth century.
