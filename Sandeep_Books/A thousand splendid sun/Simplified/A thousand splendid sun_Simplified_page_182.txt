Then he angrily left the house.

When the money ran out, hunger started to take over their lives. Mariam was shocked at how quickly being hungry became the most important thing for them.

Plain boiled white rice, with no meat or sauce, was now a rare treat. They missed meals more and more often. Sometimes Rasheed brought home canned sardines and hard, dry bread that tasted awful. Sometimes he stole bags of apples, even though it was very dangerous. In stores, he carefully hid canned ravioli, which they split five ways, with Zalmai getting the biggest share. They ate raw turnips with salt, soft lettuce leaves, and blackened bananas for dinner.

They could actually die from starving. Some people didn’t want to wait for that to happen.

Mariam heard about a widow nearby who mixed rat poison with dried bread and fed it to her seven kids, saving the biggest piece for herself.

Aziza’s ribs showed through her skin, and her cheeks lost all their fat. Her calves got thin, and her skin looked pale like weak tea. When Mariam picked her up, she could feel her hip bone under her skin. Zalmai lay around the house with dull, half-closed eyes, or limp in his dad’s lap. He cried himself to sleep when he had the energy, but his sleep was restless and broken. Mariam saw white spots in front of her eyes when she stood up. Her head spun, and her ears rang all the time.

She remembered something Mullah Faizullah said about hunger during Ramadan: Even the meanest man can sleep, but not the hungry.

"My children are going to die," Laila said. "Right in front of me."

"They are not," Mariam said. "I won’t let that happen. It’s going to be okay, Laila jo. I know what to do."

One hot day, Mariam put on her burqa, and she and Rasheed walked to the Intercontinental Hotel. They couldn’t afford bus fare anymore, and Mariam was very tired when they finally reached the top of the steep hill. She felt dizzy a few times and had to stop and wait for it to pass.

At the hotel entrance, Rasheed greeted and hugged one of the doormen, who wore a burgundy suit and visor cap. They talked in a friendly way.

Rasheed put his hand on the doorman’s elbow and pointed at Mariam once. They both looked at her for a moment. Mariam thought the doorman looked kind of familiar.

After the doorman went inside, Mariam and Rasheed waited. From where they stood, Mariam could see the Polytechnic Institute, the old Khair khana district, and the road to Mazar.
