After the women and kids took their share, they sat on the floor around the sofrah and started eating.

Once the big meal was finished and the plates were taken to the kitchen, the tea-making rush began. People tried to remember who wanted green tea and who wanted black. At that moment, Tariq nodded and quietly slipped out the door.

Laila waited for five minutes before following him.

She found him three houses down, leaning against the wall by the entrance of a narrow alley between two houses. He was humming an old Pashto song by Ustad Awal Mir: "This is our beautiful land, this is our beloved land."

He was smoking, a new habit he picked up from the guys Laila had seen him hanging out with lately. She didn’t like these new friends of Tariq’s.

They all dressed the same way—pleated pants and tight shirts that showed off their arms and chest. They wore too much cologne and smoked. They walked around the neighborhood in groups, joking and laughing loudly, sometimes even calling after girls, all with the same dumb, proud smiles. One of Tariq’s friends thought he looked a bit like Sylvester Stallone and insisted on being called Rambo.

“Your mom would kill you if she found out you’re smoking,” Laila said, looking around before slipping into the alley.

“But she doesn’t,” he said, moving aside to make space.

“That could change.” “Who’s going to tell? You?” Laila tapped her foot. “Tell your secret to the wind, but don’t blame it if the trees find out.” Tariq smiled, raising one eyebrow.

“Who said that?” “Khalil Gibran.” “You’re showing off.” “Give me a cigarette.” He shook his head no and crossed his arms. This was a new pose for him: back against the wall, arms crossed, cigarette hanging from his mouth, and one leg bent casually.

“Why not?” “Bad for you,” he answered.
