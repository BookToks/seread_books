Kabul, Spring 1987

Nine-year-old Laila got out of bed, like she usually did, hoping to see her friend Tariq. But today, she knew she wouldn’t see him.

"How long will you be gone?" she asked when Tariq said his parents were taking him to the city of Ghazni to visit his uncle.

"Thirteen days."

"Thirteen days?"

"It's not that long. You’re making a face, Laila."

"I'm not."

"You're not going to cry, are you?"

"I'm not going to cry! Not over you. Not ever." She kicked his real shin, and he playfully hit the back of her head.

Thirteen days. Almost two weeks. After five days, Laila learned something important about time: like the accordion Tariq’s dad played, time felt longer or shorter depending on if Tariq was there or not.

Downstairs, her parents were fighting again. Laila knew what would happen: Mammy, angry and loud, pacing and yelling; Babi, sitting quietly, looking sad and just waiting for the fight to end. Laila closed her door and changed, but she could still hear them. She could still hear her parents fighting.

Finally, a door slammed. Heavy footsteps.

Mammy’s bed creaked loudly. Babi would survive to see another day.

"Laila!" he called. "I’m going to be late for work!"

"One minute!" Laila put on her shoes and quickly brushed her blond curls in the mirror.

Mammy always told Laila she got her hair color, thick lashes, green eyes, dimples, high cheekbones, and pouty lower lip from her great-grandmother. Mammy said Laila was a real beauty.
