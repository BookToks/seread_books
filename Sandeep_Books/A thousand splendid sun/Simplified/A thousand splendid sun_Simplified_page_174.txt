Laila groaned.

"You can buy the medicine yourself, but—"  
"Write the name," Mariam said. "You write it down and I'll get it."  

Under her burqa, the doctor shook her head quickly. "There is no time," she said. "First, none of the nearby pharmacies have it. You would have to fight through traffic from one place to another, maybe all the way across town, and you probably wouldn’t find it. It’s almost eight thirty now, so you might get arrested for breaking curfew.

Even if you find the medicine, you probably can’t afford it. Or you might end up in a bidding war with someone just as desperate. There is no time. This baby needs to come out now."  

"Tell me what’s going on!" Laila said. She pushed herself up on her elbows.

The doctor took a breath and told Laila the hospital had no anesthetic.

"But if we wait, you will lose your baby."  
"Then cut me open," Laila said. She lay back down and pulled her knees up. "Cut me open and give me my baby."

Inside the old, dirty operating room, Laila lay on a gurney as the doctor washed her hands in a basin. Laila was shaking. She sucked in air through her teeth every time the nurse wiped her belly with a cloth soaked in a yellow-brown liquid. Another nurse stood at the door, opening it a little to look outside.

The doctor had taken off her burqa now, and Mariam saw she had silver hair, tired eyes, and small bags under her mouth from being so tired.

“They want us to operate in burqa,” the doctor said, nodding toward the nurse at the door. “She watches for them coming; I cover.” She said this calmly, like she was used to it. Mariam understood this woman was past being angry. She knew she was lucky just to have a job, and there was always something else they could take away.

There were two metal rods standing up on each side of Laila’s shoulders. The nurse who cleaned Laila’s belly pinned a sheet to the rods with clothespins. It made a curtain between Laila and the doctor.

Mariam stood behind Laila’s head and lowered her face so their cheeks touched. She could feel Laila’s teeth shaking. Their hands held tight.

Through the curtain, Mariam saw the doctor move to Laila’s left and the nurse to the right. Laila’s lips pulled back. Spit bubbles formed and popped on her clenched teeth. She made quick, soft hissing sounds.

The doctor said, “Be brave, little sister.” She bent over Laila.

Laila’s eyes suddenly opened. Then her mouth opened too. She held still, shaking, her neck muscles tight, sweat dripping from her face, her fingers squeezing Mariam’s.

Mariam would always admire how long Laila waited before she screamed.
