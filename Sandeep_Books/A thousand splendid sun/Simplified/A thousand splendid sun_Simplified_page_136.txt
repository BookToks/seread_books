Mariam

During the day, the girl was barely noticeable, like the creak of a bed or the sound of footsteps upstairs. Sometimes, Mariam would see a quick flash of her dress or hear sandals tapping as the girl hurried by.

But it was impossible for them not to bump into each other. They would meet on the stairs, in the hallway, the kitchen, or by the door when the girl came in from outside. When this happened, the air between them felt awkward and tense.

The girl would lift her skirt and quietly say sorry. As she walked past, Mariam would sneak a look and see her face turn red. Sometimes, Mariam could even smell Rasheed on the girl—his sweat, tobacco, and hunger. Luckily, Mariam didn’t have to think about sex anymore. It was over for her, and just thinking about being with Rasheed made her feel sick.

But at night, they couldn’t avoid each other. Rasheed said they were a family and families had to eat together.

“What is this?” he said, picking meat off a bone. They had stopped using spoons and forks soon after he married the girl. “Did I marry two statues? Come on, Mariam, say something to her. Where are your manners?” 

He said to the girl, “Don’t blame her. She’s quiet, which is a good thing. If someone doesn’t have much to say, they should keep their words to themselves. You and I are city people, but she’s from the countryside. Not even really from the village, her dad put her in a mud house outside it. Mariam, have you told her that you’re harami? Well, she is. But she’s got some good points too. You’ll see, Laila jan. She’s strong, works hard, and isn’t full of herself. If she were a car, she’d be a Volga.”

Mariam was 33 now, but the word “harami” still hurt her. It made her feel like she was a bug or a mistake. She remembered Nana grabbing her wrists and calling her clumsy and harami. This was the punishment for everything she’d been through.

Rasheed said to the girl, “You, you’d be a Benz. A shiny, fancy Benz. But you have to be careful with a Benz because it’s special and needs respect. You must think I’m crazy talking about cars like this. I’m not saying you’re cars. I’m just making a point.”

Then he stopped eating and looked serious.

“You shouldn’t speak badly about the dead, especially the shaheed. I don’t mean disrespect, but I have some doubts about how your parents, may Allah forgive them, raised you.”
