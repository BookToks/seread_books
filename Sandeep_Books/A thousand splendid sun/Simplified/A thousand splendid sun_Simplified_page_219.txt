Mariam felt like she was back in a small hut after all these years.

The Walayat women's prison was a plain, square building in Shar-e-Nau near Chicken Street. It was in the middle of a bigger place that held men. A locked door kept Mariam and the other women apart from the men. Mariam counted five working cells. They were empty rooms with dirty, peeling walls and small windows facing the courtyard. The windows had bars but no glass or curtains. Even though the cell doors were unlocked and the women could go outside whenever they wanted, the Talib guards could see inside. Some women said the guards smoked by the windows and made rude jokes about them. Because of this, most women wore burqas all day and only lifted them after dark, when the main gate was locked and the guards were gone.

At night, Mariam shared a dark cell with five women and four children. When there was electricity, they lifted Naghma, a short girl with black curly hair, up to the ceiling. There was a wire there with no cover. Naghma would wrap the live wire around the lightbulb to make it work.

The toilets were tiny with cracked cement floors. There was a small hole in the ground filled with poop, and flies buzzed around it. In the middle of the prison was an open courtyard with a well. The well had no drainage, so the courtyard was often swampy, and the water tasted bad. Laundry lines with socks and diapers crossed the courtyard. This was where the women met visitors and boiled the rice their families brought because the prison gave no food. The courtyard was also the kids’ playground. Mariam learned many kids were born in Walayat and never saw the outside world. She watched them run and play, barefoot and muddy, not caring about the bad smell or the guards until one hit them.

Mariam had no visitors. That was the only thing she asked the Talib officials: no visitors.

None of the women in Mariam’s cell were in for violent crimes. They were all there for “running away from home.” Because of this, Mariam became well-known among them, almost like a celebrity. The women looked at her with respect. They offered her their blankets and competed to share their food with her.
