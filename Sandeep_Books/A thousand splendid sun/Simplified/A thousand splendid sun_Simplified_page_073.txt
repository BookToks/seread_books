Hasina had told Laila, during one of her rare serious moments, that it was already decided she would marry her first cousin, who was twenty years older and owned a car shop in Lahore. "I've seen him twice," Hasina said. "Both times he ate with his mouth open."

"Beans, girls," Hasina said. "Remember that. Unless," she smiled mischievously and nudged Laila with her elbow, "it's your young, handsome, one-legged prince who comes knocking." Laila pushed the elbow away. She would have been upset if anyone else said that about Tariq. But she knew Hasina didn’t mean to be mean. She liked to joke about everyone, even herself.

"You shouldn't talk like that about people!" Giti said.

"What people?" Hasina asked.

"People who got hurt because of the war," Giti said seriously, not realizing Hasina was teasing.

"I think Mullah Giti here has a crush on Tariq. I knew it! Ha! But he's already spoken for, right, Laila?" "I do not have a crush. On anyone!" Laila said. They stopped talking and, still arguing, turned into their street.

Laila walked alone the last three blocks. When she got to her street, she saw the blue Benz was still parked outside Rasheed and Mariam’s house. An old man in a brown suit was standing by the car, leaning on a cane, looking up at the house.

Then a voice behind Laila said, "Hey. Yellow Hair. Look here." Laila turned around and saw the barrel of a gun pointed at her.
