"I don't like it," she said. "Guns scare me." Tariq turned the magazine over in his hand. "They found three bodies in a house in Karteh Seh last week," he said. "Did you hear?

Sisters. All three were raped. Their throats were cut. Someone had bitten the rings off their fingers.

You could see the teeth marks." "I don't want to hear this." "I don't mean to upset you," Tariq said, "but I just... I feel better carrying this." He was her link to the streets now. He heard news from people and shared it with her.

Tariq was the one who told her, for example, that fighters in the mountains practiced shooting and bet on their skills by shooting random civilians below—men, women, and children. He told her they fired rockets at cars but, for some reason, left taxis alone. This explained to Laila why many people were painting their cars yellow recently.

Tariq explained the dangerous, changing borders within Kabul. Laila learned from him that this road, up to the second acacia tree on the left, belonged to one warlord; the next four blocks, ending with the bakery next to the ruined pharmacy, belonged to another warlord; and if she crossed that street and walked half a mile west, she would be in another warlord’s area, where snipers might shoot at her. And these men, once called heroes by Mammy, were now called warlords. Laila heard them called iofangdar too—riflemen. Some still called them Mujahideen, but when they did, they made a sneering face, like the word was an insult full of hate.

Tariq snapped the magazine back into his handgun. "Do you have it in you?" Laila asked. "To what?" "To use this thing. To kill with it." Tariq tucked the gun into the waist of his jeans. Then he said something both sweet and scary. "For you," he said, "I'd kill with it for you, Laila." He moved closer to her, and their hands touched once, then again. When Tariq’s fingers gently slid into hers, Laila let him. And when he suddenly leaned over and kissed her, she let him again.

At that moment, all of Mammy’s talk about reputations and mynah birds seemed unimportant to Laila. Silly, even. In the middle of all this violence and chaos, it felt like a small, harmless thing to sit under a tree and kiss Tariq. A little thing she could forgive herself for.
