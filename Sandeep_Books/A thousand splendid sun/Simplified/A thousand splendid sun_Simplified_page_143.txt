Early one morning in the spring of 1993, Mariam stood by the living room window and watched Rasheed walk the girl out of the house. The girl was moving slowly, bent over, with one arm protecting her big belly, which showed under her burqa. Rasheed, nervous and very careful, held her elbow and guided her across the yard like a traffic cop. He made a "Wait here" sign, ran to the front gate, then motioned for her to come forward, holding the gate open with his foot. When she got to him, he took her hand and helped her through the gate. Mariam could almost hear him say, "Be careful, my flower, my gul." They came back early the next evening.

Mariam saw Rasheed come into the yard first. He let go of the gate too soon, and it almost hit the girl in the face. He quickly crossed the yard. Mariam noticed a shadow on his face, a dark feeling under the orange light of dusk. Inside the house, he took off his coat and threw it on the couch. Passing Mariam, he said sharply, "I'm hungry. Get supper ready." The front door opened. Mariam saw the girl holding a wrapped baby in her left arm. One foot was outside, the other inside, holding the door from closing. She was bent over and making grunting sounds, trying to reach a paper bag she had put down to open the door. Her face showed how hard it was. She looked up and saw Mariam.

Mariam turned and went to the kitchen to warm Rasheed's food.

"It's like someone is stabbing a screwdriver into my ear," Rasheed said, rubbing his eyes.

He stood at Mariam’s door, eyes puffy, wearing only a loose aiumban. His white hair stuck out in all directions. "This crying. I can't take it." Downstairs, the girl was walking the baby around, trying to sing to her.

"I haven’t slept well in two months," Rasheed said. "And the room smells awful. There are dirty clothes all over. I stepped on one the other night." Mariam smiled secretly.

"Take her outside!" Rasheed yelled over his shoulder. "Can't you take her outside?" The singing stopped for a moment. "She'll catch pneumonia!" "It's summer!" "What?"

Rasheed clenched his teeth and shouted, "I said, it’s warm out!" "I'm not taking her outside!" The singing started again. "Sometimes, I swear, I want to put that baby in a box and let her float down the Kabul River. Like baby Moses." Mariam never heard him call his daughter by the name the girl gave her, Aziza, which means "Cherished One."
