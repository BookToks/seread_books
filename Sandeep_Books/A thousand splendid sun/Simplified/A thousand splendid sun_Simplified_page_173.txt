Two women were giving birth. There were no curtains between the beds. Laila got a bed at the far end, under a window that someone had painted black. Nearby was a sink that was cracked and dry, with a string over it holding stained surgical gloves.

In the middle of the room, Mariam saw an aluminum table. The top shelf had a dirty blanket on it, and the bottom shelf was empty.

One of the women noticed Mariam looking.

“They put the live babies on the top,” she said tiredly.

The doctor wore a dark blue burqa and was small and nervous, moving quickly like a bird.

Everything she said sounded impatient and urgent.

“First baby,” she said like it was a fact, not a question.

“Second,” Mariam answered.

Laila cried out and rolled onto her side. Her fingers grabbed Mariam’s.

“Any problems with the first delivery?” asked the doctor.

“No,” Mariam said.

“You the mother?” the doctor asked.

“Yes,” Mariam said.

The doctor lifted the lower part of her burqa and took out a metal cone-shaped tool. She lifted Laila’s burqa and put the wide end on her belly and the narrow end to her ear. She listened for almost a minute, moved it around, and listened again.

“I have to feel the baby now, hamshira,” she said. She put on one of the gloves hanging by the sink. She pressed on Laila’s belly with one hand and slid the other inside. Laila whimpered. When done, the doctor gave the glove to a nurse, who rinsed it and hung it back on the string.

“Your daughter needs a caesarian. Do you know what that is? We have to cut open her womb to take the baby out because it’s in the breech position.”

“I don’t understand,” Mariam said.

The doctor explained the baby was in a position that wouldn’t let it come out normally. “Too much time has passed. We need to go to the operating room now.” Laila nodded weakly and her head fell to one side.

“There’s something I have to tell you,” the doctor said. She moved closer to Mariam and spoke quietly, a little embarrassed.

“What is she saying?” Laila groaned. “Is something wrong with the baby?”

“But how will she handle it?” Mariam asked.

The doctor’s voice changed, sounding defensive.

“You think I want it this way?” she said. “What can I do? They won’t give me what I need. No X-rays, no suction, no oxygen, not even simple antibiotics.

When NGOs offer money, the Taliban turn them away or give the money only to places that help men.”

“But, Doctor sahib, isn’t there anything you can give her?” Mariam asked.

“What’s going on?”
