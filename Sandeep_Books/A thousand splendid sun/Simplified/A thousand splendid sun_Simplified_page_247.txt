APRIL 2003

The drought is finally over. It snowed a lot this past winter, and now it’s been raining for days. The Kabul River is flowing again. The spring floods have washed away Titanic City.

There is mud all over the streets now. Shoes make squishy sounds. Cars get stuck. Donkeys carrying apples walk slowly, their hooves splashing mud from the puddles. But no one is upset about the mud, and no one feels sad about Titanic City. People say they want Kabul to be green again.

Yesterday, Laila watched her kids play outside in the heavy rain, jumping from one puddle to another in their backyard under a grey sky. She was looking through the kitchen window of their small two-bedroom house they rent in Deh Mazang. There is a pomegranate tree in the yard and some sweetbriar bushes. Tariq fixed the walls and made a slide, a swing set, and a small fenced area for Zalmai’s new goat. Laila saw the rain dripping off Zalmai’s shaved head; he wanted it cut like Tariq’s, who now leads the Babaloo prayers. The rain made Aziza’s long hair wet and messy, and she shook her head, spraying water on Zalmai.

Zalmai is almost six. Aziza is ten. They celebrated her birthday last week and took her to Cinema Park, where Titanic was finally shown to the people of Kabul.

“Come on, kids, we’re going to be late,” Laila said, putting their lunches in a paper bag. It was eight in the morning. Laila had woken up at five. As always, Aziza woke her up for morning prayers. Laila knows these prayers are Aziza’s way of holding on to Mariam, keeping her memory alive before time takes her away.

After prayers, Laila went back to sleep and was still asleep when Tariq left the house.

She barely remembers him kissing her on the cheek. Tariq got a job with a French group that helps people hurt by land mines by giving them prosthetic limbs.

Zalmai ran after Aziza into the kitchen.

“Do you have your notebooks? Pencils? Textbooks?” Laila asked.

“Yes,” Aziza said, lifting her backpack. Laila noticed her stutter is getting better.

“Let’s go then.” 

Laila let the children out of the house and locked the door.
