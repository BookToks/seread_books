JANUARY 1989

One cold, cloudy day in January 1989, three months before Laila turned eleven, she went with her parents and Hasina to watch one of the last Soviet convoys leave the city.

People stood on both sides of the street outside the Military Club near Wazir Akbar Khan. They stood in muddy snow, watching tanks, armored trucks, and jeeps as light snow blew across the headlights. Some people shouted mean things. Afghan soldiers kept the crowd off the street and sometimes fired warning shots.

Mammy held up a photo of Ahmad and Noor high above her head. It was a picture of them sitting back to back under a pear tree. Other women held up pictures of their husbands, sons, and brothers who had died.

Someone tapped Laila and Hasina on the shoulder. It was Tariq.

“Where did you get that?” Hasina asked.

“I thought I’d dress for the occasion,” Tariq said. He wore a huge Russian fur hat with earflaps pulled down.

“How do I look?” “Ridiculous,” Laila laughed.

“That’s the point.” “Did your parents let you come dressed like this?” “They’re at home,” he said.

Last fall, Tariq’s uncle in Ghazni died of a heart attack. A few weeks later, Tariq’s father had a heart attack too. He became weak, tired, anxious, and sometimes very sad for weeks. Laila was happy to see Tariq acting like his old self again. Before, he had been sad and gloomy.

The three of them slipped away while Mammy and Babi watched the Soviets. Tariq bought them each a plate of boiled beans with thick cilantro sauce from a street vendor. They ate under the roof of a closed rug shop. Then Hasina went to find her family.

On the bus ride home, Tariq and Laila sat behind her parents. Mammy sat by the window, staring outside and holding the picture close to her chest. Babi listened quietly to a man arguing that even though the Soviets might leave, they would still send weapons to Najibullah in Kabul.

“He’s their puppet.”
