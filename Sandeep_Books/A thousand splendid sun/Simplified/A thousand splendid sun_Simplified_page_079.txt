Mammy looked tired and stared out the window. "You're clean, and everything is okay." Laila stood up. "I have homework now."  
"Of course you do. Close the curtains before you go, my love," Mammy said softly. She was already lying down under the sheets.  

As Laila reached for the curtains, she saw a car driving by on the street, kicking up dust. It was the blue Benz with the Herat license plate finally leaving. She watched it until it disappeared around the corner, the back window shining in the sun.  

"I won't forget tomorrow," Mammy said behind her. "I promise."  
"You said that yesterday."  
"You don't know, Laila."  
"Know what?" Laila turned to face her mother. "What don’t I know?"  
Mammy put her hand on her chest and tapped it. "In here. What’s in here." Then her hand dropped softly. "You just don’t know."
