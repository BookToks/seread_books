They step outside into the cool morning. It’s not raining today. The sky is blue, and Laila doesn’t see any clouds far away. Holding hands, the three of them walk to the bus stop. The streets are already busy with rickshaws, taxicabs, UN trucks, buses, and ISAF jeeps. Sleepy shopkeepers are opening their stores that were closed all night. Vendors sit behind piles of chewing gum and cigarette packs. The widows have already taken their spots on street corners, asking people for money.

Laila thinks it’s strange to be back in Kabul. The city has changed. Every day she sees people planting small trees, painting old houses, and carrying bricks for new ones. They dig ditches and wells. On windowsills, Laila sees flowers growing in empty shells of old Mujahideen rockets. Locals call them rocket flowers. Recently, Tariq took Laila and the kids to the Gardens of Babur, which are being fixed up. For the first time in years, Laila hears music on Kabul’s street corners—rubab and tabla, dooiar, harmonium, and tamboura, old songs by Ahmad Zahir.

Laila wishes her mom and dad were alive to see these changes. But, like Mil’s letter, Kabul’s apology came too late.

Laila and the children are about to cross the street to the bus stop when suddenly a black Land Cruiser with dark windows speeds by. It swerves at the last moment and misses Laila by less than an arm’s length. It splashes dirty rainwater all over the children’s shirts.

Laila quickly pulls her kids back onto the sidewalk, her heart racing.

The Land Cruiser speeds away, honks twice, and turns sharply left.

Laila stands there, trying to catch her breath, holding her children’s wrists tightly.

It breaks Laila’s heart. It hurts her that the warlords are back in Kabul. That the people who killed her parents live in fancy homes with walls around them. They have important government jobs and drive around in shiny, bulletproof SUVs through neighborhoods they destroyed. It hurts her a lot.

But Laila has decided she won’t let anger control her. Mariam wouldn’t want that. “What’s the point?” Mariam would say with a smile, both simple and wise. “What good does it do, Laila jo?” So Laila has accepted that she must move on. For herself, for Tariq, for her kids. And for Mariam, who still visits her in dreams and feels close, just beneath her thoughts. Laila has moved on because she knows that’s all she can really do. That and hope.

Zaman is standing at the free throw line, knees bent, bouncing a basketball. He’s teaching a group of boys wearing matching jerseys who are sitting in a half circle on the court. Zaman sees Laila, puts the ball under his arm, and waves. He says something to the boys, who then wave and shout, “Salaam, moalim sahib!” Laila waves back.

The orphanage playground now has a row of apple saplings along the east wall.
