Niloufar let her legs hang down and pulled her blouse back down. "I could teach you," she said, brushing hair from her red forehead. "So how long will you stay here?" "I don't know." 

"My mom says you're not really my sister like you say." "I never said I was," Mariam lied.

"She says you did. I don’t care. I mean, I don’t mind if you said it or if you are my sister. I don’t mind." Mariam lay down. "I'm tired now."

"My mom says a jinn made your mother hang herself." "You can stop that now," Mariam said, turning to her side. "The music, I mean."

Bibi jo came to see her that day too. It was raining when she arrived. She sat down heavily on the chair by the bed, grimacing.

"This rain, Mariam jo, it hurts my hips badly. Just bad, I tell you. I hope… Oh, now, come here, child. Come to Bibi jo. Don’t cry. There, now. You poor thing. You poor, poor thing."

That night, Mariam couldn’t sleep for a long time. She lay in bed looking at the sky, listening to footsteps below and voices muffled by walls and the heavy rain hitting the window. When she finally fell asleep, she woke up suddenly from shouting. Voices downstairs, loud and angry. Mariam couldn’t understand the words. Someone slammed a door.

The next morning, Mullah Faizullah came to visit her. When she saw her friend at the door, with his white beard and kind, toothless smile, Mariam felt tears come to her eyes again. She swung her feet off the bed and hurried over. She kissed his hand like always, and he kissed her forehead. She helped him sit in a chair.

He showed her the Koran he brought and opened it. "I thought we shouldn’t skip our usual time, huh?" 

"You know I don’t need lessons anymore, Mullah sahib. You taught me every surrah and ayat in the Koran years ago."

He smiled and raised his hands like he gave up. "I admit it. You caught me. But I can think of worse reasons to visit you."

"You don’t need reasons."
