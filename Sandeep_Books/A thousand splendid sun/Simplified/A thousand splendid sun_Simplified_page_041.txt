There was a bed, an old, gray-brown dresser, and a small closet. The window looked out into the yard and the street below. Rasheed put her suitcase in a corner.

Mariam sat on the bed.

"You didn’t notice," he said. He was standing in the doorway, bending a little to fit.

"Look on the windowsill. Do you know what kind they are? I put them there before I left for Herat." Mariam finally saw a basket on the sill. White tuberoses were spilling out of it.

"You like them? Do they make you happy?" "Yes." "You can thank me then." "Thank you. I’m sorry. Tashakor." "You’re shaking. Maybe I scare you. Do I scare you? Are you afraid of me?" Mariam didn’t look at him, but she heard something playful in his questions, like he was teasing her. She quickly shook her head. That was the first lie she told in their marriage.

"No? That’s good then. Good for you. Well, this is your home now. You’re going to like it here. You’ll see. Did I tell you we have electricity? Most days and every night?" He acted like he was going to leave. At the door, he paused, took a long drag of his cigarette, and squinted his eyes against the smoke. Mariam thought he was going to say something else, but he didn’t. He closed the door and left her alone with her suitcase and flowers.
