Sometimes, Mammy showed her old, wrinkled newspaper clippings and pamphlets that Ahmad had collected from groups fighting in Pakistan. Laila remembered one picture of a man in a long white coat giving a lollipop to a little boy without legs. The caption said: Children are the main victims of Soviet land mines. The article explained that the Soviets hid bombs inside colorful toys. If a kid picked one up, it would blow up and hurt their fingers or hand. The father couldn’t fight then; he had to stay home and take care of his child. In another article in Ahmad’s box, a young fighter said that the Soviets dropped gas on his village that burned skin and blinded people. He said he saw his mother and sister running to a stream, coughing blood.

  
“Mammy.” The pile moved a little. It made a groaning sound.

  
“Get up, Mammy. It’s three o’clock.” Another groan. A hand popped out like a submarine periscope, then dropped back. The pile shifted more. Then blankets rustled as they moved. Slowly, Mammy appeared: messy hair first, then her pale, grimacing face, eyes squeezed shut against the light, a hand searching for the headboard, the sheets sliding down as she pulled herself up, groaning.

  
Mammy tried to look up but flinched from the light and dropped her head down.

  
“How was school?” she mumbled.

  
So it began. The usual questions, the usual answers. Both pretending.

  
They were both tired of this old routine.

  
“School was fine,” Laila said.

  
“Did you learn anything?” “The usual.” “Did you eat?” “I did.” “Good.” Mammy lifted her head again, looking toward the window. She winced and blinked. The right side of her face was red, and her hair was flat there.

  
“I have a headache.”
