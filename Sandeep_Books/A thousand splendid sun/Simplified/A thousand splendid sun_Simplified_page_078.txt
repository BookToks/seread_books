"Do you want me to get you some aspirin?" Mammy rubbed her temples.  
"Maybe later. Is your dad home?"  
"It's only three."  
"Oh, right. You said that already." Mammy yawned.  

"I was dreaming just now," she said quietly, barely louder than the sound of her nightgown moving on the sheets.  
"Just before you came in. But I can't remember it now. Does that happen to you?"  
"Everyone has that happen, Mammy."  
"That's so weird."  

"I should tell you, while you were dreaming, a boy sprayed pee on my hair with a water gun."  
"What? What did you say? I'm sorry."  
"Pee. Urine."  
"That's... that's awful. Oh God, I'm sorry. Poor you. I'll talk to him first thing in the morning. Or maybe to his mom. That would be better, I think."  

"I haven’t told you who it was."  
"Oh. Well, who was it?"  
"Never mind."  
"You're upset."  

"You were supposed to pick me up."  
"I was," Mammy whispered. Laila wasn’t sure if that was a question. Mammy started picking at her hair. Laila always wondered how Mammy’s picking hadn’t made her bald already.  

"What about your friend, Tariq? What about him?"  
"He's been gone for a week."  
"Oh." Mammy sighed through her nose.  
"Did you wash?"  
"Yes."  
"So you’re clean, then."
