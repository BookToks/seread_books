No?

Was Mariam being mean to her?

"That's it, right?" "No." "I swear, I'll go down and teach her a lesson. Who does she think she is, that harami, treating you like that?" "No!" He was already getting up, but she grabbed his arm and pulled him back down.

"Don't! No! She's been nice to me. I just need a minute. I'll be okay." He sat next to her, gently touching her neck, whispering. His hand slowly moved down her back, then back up. He leaned in, showing his crowded teeth.

"Let's see," he said quietly, "if I can make you feel better."

First, the trees that hadn’t been cut down for firewood dropped their yellow and copper leaves. Then the cold, harsh winds blew through the city. They ripped off the last leaves, leaving the trees looking like ghosts against the dull brown hills. The first snow of the season fell lightly, melting as soon as it touched the ground. Then the roads froze, and snow piled up on rooftops and frosted windows.

With the snow came kites. They used to rule Kabul’s winter skies, but now they were shy, flying where rockets and fighter jets zoomed.

Rasheed kept bringing news about the war, and Laila was confused by the sides he talked about. Sayyaf was fighting the Hazaras, he said. The Hazaras were fighting Massoud.

"And Massoud is fighting Hekmatyar, who is supported by the Pakistanis. Massoud and Hekmatyar hate each other. Sayyaf is on Massoud’s side. Hekmatyar supports the Hazaras for now." 

Rasheed said no one knew where Dostum, the Uzbek commander, stood. Dostum had fought the Soviets in the 1980s with the Mujahideen but then joined the communist government after the Soviets left. He even got a medal from Najibullah before switching back to the Mujahideen. Right now, Rasheed said, Dostum was with Massoud.

In Kabul, especially in the west, fires burned and black smoke rose over snowy buildings. Embassies closed. Schools fell apart. In hospital waiting rooms, Rasheed said, people were bleeding to death. In operating rooms, limbs were being cut off without anesthesia.

"But don’t worry," Rasheed said. "You’re safe with me, my flower, my gul. If anyone tries to hurt you, I’ll rip out their liver and make them eat it."

That winter, everywhere Laila looked, walls blocked her path. She missed the wide open skies from her childhood, the days she went to buzkashi games with Babi and shopped with Mammy, the times she ran free and gossiped about boys with Giti and Hasina. She missed sitting with Tariq in a clover field by a stream, trading riddles and candy, watching the sunset.

But thinking about Tariq was painful, because before she could stop, she saw him lying in a hospital bed, far from home, with tubes stuck in his burned body.
