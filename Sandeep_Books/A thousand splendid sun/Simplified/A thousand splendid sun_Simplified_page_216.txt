She winced and quietly left the bedroom.

In Mariam's room, the light was a little darker than gray, the kind of light Laila always thought of with roosters crowing and dew on the grass. Mariam sat in a corner on a prayer rug facing the window. Slowly, Laila sat down on the floor across from her.

"You should go see Aziza this morning," Mariam said.

"I know what you want to do." "Don't walk. Take the bus, you’ll blend in. Taxis are too obvious. They’ll stop you if you’re alone." "What you promised last night…" Laila couldn’t finish. The trees, the lake, the unknown village. It was a dream, she realized. A nice lie to make her feel better. Like talking softly to a sad child.

"I meant it," Mariam said. "I meant it for you, Laila jo." "I don’t want any of it without you," Laila whispered.

Mariam smiled weakly.

"I want it to be just like you said, Mariam—all of us going together, you, me, and the kids.

Tariq has a place in Pakistan. We can hide there for a while, wait for things to calm down." "That’s not possible," Mariam said calmly, like a parent talking to a well-meaning but confused child.

"We’ll take care of each other," Laila said, her voice breaking, tears in her eyes.

"Like you said. No. I’ll take care of you this time." "Oh, Laila jo." Laila started talking fast, trying to convince her. She promised she’d do all the cleaning and cooking. "You won’t have to do anything. Ever again. You can rest, sleep in, plant a garden. Whatever you want, just ask and I’ll get it for you. Please don’t do this, Mariam. Don’t leave me. Don’t break Aziza’s heart." "They cut off hands for stealing bread," Mariam said. "What do you think they’ll do when they find a dead husband and two missing wives?" "No one will know," Laila whispered. "No one will find us." "They will."
