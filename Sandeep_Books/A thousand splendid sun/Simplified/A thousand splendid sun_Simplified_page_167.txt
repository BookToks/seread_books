 "This isn't some village. This is Kabul. Women here used to practice law and medicine; they held office in the government " Rasheed grinned. "Spoken like the arrogant daughter of a poetry reading university man that you are. How urbane, how Tajik, of you. You think this is some new, radical idea the Taliban are bringing? Have you ever lived outside of your precious little shell in Kabul, my gull Ever cared to visit the real Afghanistan, the south, the east, along the tribal border with Pakistan? No? I have. And I can tell you that there are many places in this country that have always lived this way, or close enough anyhow. Not that you would know." "I refuse to believe it," Laila said "They're not serious." "What the Taliban did to Najibullah looked serious to me," Rasheed said. "Wouldn't you agree?" "He was a communist! He was the head of the Secret Police." Rasheed laughed.
 
 Mariam heard the answer in his laugh: that in the eyes of the Taliban, being a communist and the leader of the dreaded KHAD made Najibullah only slightly more contemptible than a woman.
