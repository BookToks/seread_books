They were sitting on the living room floor, eating dinner less than a week after they had seen Najibullah’s dead body hanging by a rope.

“They can’t make half the people stay home and do nothing,” Laila said.

“Why not?” Rasheed asked. For once, Mariam agreed with him. Hadn’t he done the same to her and Laila? Surely Laila understood that.

“This isn’t some village. This is Kabul. Women here used to work as lawyers and doctors; they even had jobs in the government.” Rasheed smiled. “You sound like the proud daughter of a poetry-loving university man. How fancy, how Tajik of you. Do you think the Taliban are bringing some new, crazy idea? Have you ever lived outside your little world in Kabul, my naive girl? Ever been to the real Afghanistan, the south, the east, near the tribal border with Pakistan? No? I have. And I can tell you, many places in this country have always lived like this, or close to it. But you wouldn’t know.”

“I refuse to believe it,” Laila said. “They’re not serious.”

“What the Taliban did to Najibullah looked serious to me,” Rasheed said. “Don’t you agree?”

“He was a communist! He was head of the Secret Police.” Rasheed laughed.

Mariam heard the meaning in his laugh: to the Taliban, being a communist and the leader of the feared KHAD made Najibullah only a little worse than a woman.
