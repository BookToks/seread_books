Laila moved and rested her head on Mammy's chest.

"Some days," Mammy said in a rough voice, "I listen to that clock ticking in the hallway.

Then I think about all the ticks, all the minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years waiting for me. All of it without them. And I can't breathe then, like someone is stepping on my heart, Laila. I get so weak. So weak I just want to fall down somewhere." 

"I wish there was something I could do," Laila said, meaning it. But it sounded like a boring, usual thing to say, like a kind stranger trying to help.

"You're a good daughter," Mammy said after a deep sigh. "And I haven't been a good mother to you." 

"Don't say that." 

"Oh, it’s true. I know it, and I’m sorry, my love." 

"Mammy?" 

"Mm." Laila sat up and looked at Mammy. There were gray hairs in Mammy’s hair now.

It shocked Laila how much weight Mammy, who had always been chubby, had lost. Her cheeks looked pale and tired. The blouse she wore hung loosely on her shoulders, and there was a big space between her neck and the collar. Laila had seen the wedding ring fall off Mammy’s finger more than once.

"I’ve been meaning to ask you something." 

"What is it?" 

"You wouldn’t..." Laila started.

She had talked about it with Hasina. Hasina suggested they throw away the aspirin bottle in the gutter, hide the kitchen knives and sharp kebab sticks under the rug by the couch. Hasina had found a rope in the yard. When Babi couldn’t find his razors, Laila had to tell him her worries. He sat on the edge of the couch, hands between his knees. Laila waited for him to say something to make her feel better. But all he did was look confused and empty.

"You wouldn’t... Mammy, I’m worried that—"

"I thought about it the night we got the news," Mammy said. "I won’t lie, I’ve thought about it since then too. But no. Don’t worry, Laila. I want to see my sons’ dream come true. I want to see the day the Soviets go home ashamed, the day the Mujahideen win in Kabul. I want to be there when it happens, when Afghanistan is free, so the boys can see it too. They’ll see it through my eyes." 

Mammy soon fell asleep, leaving Laila with mixed feelings: glad that Mammy wanted to keep living, but hurt that she wasn’t the reason. Laila knew she would never leave a mark on Mammy’s heart like her brothers had, because Mammy’s heart was like a pale beach where Laila’s footprints would always wash away under the waves of sadness that kept coming and going.
