When the bus goes past the shrine of Imam Reza, the eighth Shi'a imam, Laila stretches her neck to see its shiny tiles, tall towers, and the amazing golden dome. Everything looks so clean and carefully kept. She thinks about the Buddhas back in her country. Now, they are just tiny pieces of dust, blowing around in the Bamiyan Valley.

The bus ride to the Iranian-Afghan border takes almost ten hours. The land looks emptier and more dry as they get closer to Afghanistan. Just before they cross into Herat, they pass a camp for Afghan refugees. To Laila, it looks like a mix of yellow dust, black tents, and small buildings made from metal sheets. She reaches over and holds Tariq's hand.

In Herat, most streets have pavement and are lined with nice pine trees. There are parks and libraries being fixed, neat courtyards, and buildings with fresh paint. The traffic lights work, and, surprisingly, the electricity is steady. Laila has heard that Herat’s warlord, Ismail Khan, has helped rebuild the city with money he collects at the Afghan-Iranian border. The central government says that money should belong to them, not him. The taxi driver who takes them to the Muwaffaq Hotel speaks about Ismail Khan with both respect and fear.

Staying two nights at the Muwaffaq will use up almost a fifth of their savings, but the trip from Mashad was long and tiring, and the kids are very tired. The old man at the hotel desk tells Tariq, while giving him the room key, that the Muwaffaq is popular with journalists and aid workers.

“Bin Laden stayed here once,” he says proudly.

The room has two beds and a bathroom with cold running water. Between the beds, there is a painting of the poet Khaja Abdullah Ansary. From the window, Laila can see the busy street below and a park across the street with colorful brick paths and lots of flowers. The children, who are used to watching TV, are sad there isn’t one in the room. But soon, they fall asleep. Tariq and Laila also collapse from tiredness. Laila sleeps well in Tariq’s arms, except once in the middle of the night when she wakes up from a dream she can’t remember.

The next morning, after breakfast with tea, fresh bread, quince jam, and boiled eggs, Tariq finds her a taxi.

“Are you sure you don’t want me to come with you?” Tariq asks. Aziza is holding his hand, Zalmai isn’t, but he stands close, leaning on Tariq’s hip.

“I’m sure,” Laila says. “I worry.”
