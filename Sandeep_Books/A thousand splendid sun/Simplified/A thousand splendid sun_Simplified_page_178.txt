Laila said no again. They were in the living room. Mariam and the kids were in the kitchen. Laila could hear the noise of dishes, Zalmai's high-pitched laugh, and Aziza talking to Mariam in her calm voice.

"There will be others like her, even younger," Rasheed said. "Everyone in Kabul is doing the same." Laila told him she didn’t care what other people did with their kids.

"I'll watch her closely," Rasheed said, sounding more impatient now. "It's a safe place. There's a mosque across the street." "I won’t let you make my daughter a street beggar!" Laila said angrily.

The slap was loud. Rasheed’s big hand hit Laila’s cheek hard. Her head jerked to the side. The sounds from the kitchen stopped. The house was quiet for a moment. Then Mariam and the children came running into the living room, looking from Laila to Rasheed and back.

Then Laila hit him.

It was the first time she had hit anyone, except for the playful punches she and Tariq used to give each other. But those were light taps, friendly and fun. This punch was different. She saw her fist fly through the air and felt Rasheed’s rough skin under her knuckles. It made a sound like a heavy bag dropping on the floor. She hit him hard. He stepped back two steps.

From the other side of the room came a gasp, a yelp, and a scream. Laila didn’t know who made which sound. She was too shocked to care, waiting for her brain to understand what she had just done. When it did, she thought she might have smiled. She might have even grinned when Rasheed calmly walked out of the room.

Suddenly, all the hard things in their lives—hers, Aziza’s, and Mariam’s—felt like they vanished, gone like the disappearing palms on the TV screen. It felt like all their pain was worth it for this one moment, this act of standing up that could end all the suffering.

Laila didn’t notice Rasheed come back into the room. Not until his hand was around her throat. Until he lifted her off the ground and slammed her against the wall.

Up close, his mean face seemed huge. Laila saw how much fatter it was getting with age and how many tiny red lines covered his nose.

Rasheed didn’t say a word. And really, what could he say when he’d just pushed the barrel of his gun into his wife’s mouth?

It was the raids that made them dig in the yard. Sometimes the raids happened once a month, sometimes once a week. Lately, it was almost every day. Mostly, the Taliban took things, kicked people, or hit some on the back of the head. But sometimes there were public beatings, with lashes on the feet and hands.
