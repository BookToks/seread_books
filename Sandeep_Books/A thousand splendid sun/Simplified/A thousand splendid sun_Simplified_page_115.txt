"Yes, Babi." "Pyramid. Area. Where are you?" "Sorry, Babi. I was, uh…Let’s see. Pyramid. Pyramid. One third the area of the base times the height." Babi nodded unsure, looking at her, and Laila thought about Tariq’s hands, squeezing her breast, sliding down her back, as they kissed again and again.

One day in June, Giti was walking home from school with two friends. Just three blocks from her house, a stray rocket hit the girls. Later that awful day, Laila found out that Nila, Giti’s mom, ran up and down the street where Giti died, picking up pieces of her daughter’s flesh in an apron, screaming like crazy.

Giti’s rotting right foot, still in a nylon sock and purple sneaker, was found on a rooftop two weeks later.

At Giti’s funeral the next day, Laila sat shocked in a room full of crying women. This was the first time someone Laila knew, cared about, and loved had died. She couldn’t believe Giti was really gone.

Giti, who Laila had passed secret notes to in class, whose fingernails she had painted, whose chin hair she had plucked with tweezers. Giti, who was going to marry Sabir the goalkeeper. Giti was dead. Dead. Blown to pieces. Finally, Laila started to cry for her friend. All the tears she couldn’t cry at her brothers’ funeral came out now.
