"Aishee." "Soon." Laila kissed her daughter, trying to kiss her forehead but ended up kissing the top of her head instead. "We'll have milk soon. Just be patient. Be a good, patient little girl for Mammy, and I'll get you some aishee." Laila sang her a few songs.

Azan rang out a second time, but Rasheed still hadn’t given them any food or water. That day, a heavy, suffocating heat covered them. The room felt like a pressure cooker. Laila’s mouth was dry as she thought about the well outside, where the water was cold and fresh. Aziza kept crying, and Laila noticed with worry that when she wiped Aziza’s cheeks, her hands came back dry. She took off Aziza’s clothes, looked for something to fan her with, and ended up blowing on her until she felt dizzy. Soon, Aziza stopped crawling around and kept falling in and out of sleep.

Several times that day, Laila hit the walls with her fists and screamed for help, hoping a neighbor would hear. But no one came, and her yelling only scared Aziza, who started crying again, making weak, croaking sounds. Laila slid down to the floor, feeling guilty thinking about Mariam, who was beaten and locked in the hot toolshed.

Laila fell asleep at some point, her body burning in the heat. She dreamed that she and Aziza ran into Tariq. He was across a busy street under a shop’s awning, sitting and eating figs from a crate. "That’s your father," Laila said. "That man there, do you see him? He’s your real baba." She called his name, but the street noise was too loud, and Tariq didn’t hear her.

She woke up to the sound of rockets whistling overhead. Somewhere in the sky, there were loud blasts and the fast, scared sounds of machine guns firing. Laila closed her eyes. Then she woke again when she heard Rasheed’s heavy footsteps in the hall. She dragged herself to the door and slapped her hands against it.

"Just one glass, Rasheed. Not for me. Do it for her. You don’t want her blood on your hands." He walked past without stopping. She begged him, said sorry, made promises, and even cursed him. His door closed. The radio turned on.

The muezzin called azan a third time. The heat got worse. Aziza became even weaker.

She stopped crying and stopped moving.

Laila put her ear close to Aziza’s mouth, afraid she wouldn’t hear her breathing. Even just lifting herself up made her head spin.

She fell asleep and dreamed things she couldn’t remember. When she woke, she checked Aziza, feeling her dry, cracked lips and faint pulse on her neck, then lay down again. They were going to die here, Laila was sure. But what scared her most was that she might live longer than Aziza, who was so young and fragile. How much more could Aziza take? Aziza would die in this heat, and Laila would have to lie next to her stiff little body and wait for her own death. She fell asleep again, woke up, then fell asleep again. The line between dreaming and being awake mixed together.

It wasn’t roosters or azan that woke her up this time but the sound of something heavy being dragged. She heard a rattling. Suddenly, the room filled with light. Her eyes hurt from the brightness. Laila raised her head, winced, and covered her eyes. Through the cracks between her fingers, she saw a big, blurry shape standing in a bright doorway.
