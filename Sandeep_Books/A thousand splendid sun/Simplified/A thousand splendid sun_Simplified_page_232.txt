They are always careful about the noise—the rustling sheets and creaking bed springs. But for Laila, being with Tariq is worth dealing with these worries. When they make love, Laila feels safe and steady. Her fears that their life together might end soon go away. She stops worrying about being separated.

"What do you mean?" she asks now.

"What's happening back home. Maybe it’s not so bad after all." Back home, bombs are falling again, this time American bombs. Laila watches the war on TV every day while she changes sheets and cleans.

The Americans have helped the warlords again and got the Northern Alliance to fight the Taliban and find bin Laden.

But Laila gets angry at what Tariq says. She pushes his head off her chest.

"Not so bad? People are dying! Women, kids, old people! Homes are destroyed again! Not so bad?"

"Shh. You'll wake the kids."

"How can you say that, Tariq?" she snaps. "After what happened in Karam? A hundred innocent people! You saw the bodies!"

"No," Tariq says. He props himself up and looks down at her. "You don’t understand what I meant."

"You wouldn’t know," Laila says, her voice getting louder. They are having their first fight as husband and wife. "You left when the Mujahideen started fighting. I stayed. I know war. I lost my parents to war. My parents, Tariq. And now you say war is not so bad?"

"I'm sorry, Laila. I’m sorry." He cups her face with his hands. "You're right. Forgive me. What I meant was maybe there’s hope after this war, maybe for the first time in a long time—"

"I don’t want to talk about this anymore," Laila says, surprised at how angry she got. She knows it’s not fair because his parents died too. Her anger is already softening. Tariq speaks softly, and when he pulls her close, she lets him. When he kisses her hand and forehead, she lets him.

She knows he’s probably right. She knows what he meant. Maybe this war is necessary. Maybe there will be hope when the bombs stop falling. But she can’t say it out loud, not when what happened to her parents is happening to someone now in Afghanistan, not when some kid back home has just lost their parents to a rocket, like she did.
