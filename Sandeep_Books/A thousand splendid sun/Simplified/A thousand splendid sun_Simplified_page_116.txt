Laila could barely move, like cement had hardened in every joint of her body.

There was a conversation happening, and Laila knew she was part of it, but she felt distant, like she was just listening without really being there. As Tariq talked, Laila imagined her life as a old, worn-out rope breaking apart, its threads coming undone and falling away.

It was a hot, sticky afternoon in August 1992, and they were in Laila's living room. Mammy had a stomachache all day, and a little while ago, even though rockets from Hekmatyar were being fired nearby, Babi had taken her to see a doctor.

Now Tariq was sitting next to Laila on the couch, looking down at the floor, his hands between his knees.

He was saying he was leaving.

Not just the neighborhood. Not just Kabul. Leaving Afghanistan completely.

Leaving.

Laila felt like she couldn’t see anything.

“Where? Where will you go?” she asked. “Pakistan first. Peshawar. Then maybe India. Iran,” he answered. “How long?” “I don’t know.” “When did you find out?” “A few days ago. I wanted to tell you, Laila, I swear, but I was too scared of upsetting you.” “When?” “Tomorrow.” “Tomorrow?” “Laila, look at me.” “Tomorrow.” “It’s because of my dad. His heart can’t handle all this fighting and killing anymore.” Laila covered her face with her hands, feeling scared and hopeless.

She thought she should have guessed this was coming. Almost everyone she knew had already left. The neighborhood was almost empty, and just four months after the fighting between the Mujahideen groups started, Laila barely recognized anyone on the streets. Hasina’s family left in May for Tehran. Wajma and her family went to Islamabad that same month. Giti’s parents and siblings left in June, after Giti was killed. Laila didn’t know where they went, but she heard a rumor they went to Mashad, Iran. When people left, their houses stayed empty for a few days, then militiamen or strangers moved in.

Everyone was leaving. And now Tariq was leaving too.

“My mother isn’t young anymore,” he said. “They’re always scared. Laila, look at me.” “You should have told me.” “Please, look at me.” Laila groaned, then started crying. When he tried to wipe her tears away, she pushed his hand away. It was selfish and didn’t make sense, but she was so angry at him for leaving her—Tariq, who felt like a part of her, whose shadow was always next to hers in every memory.
