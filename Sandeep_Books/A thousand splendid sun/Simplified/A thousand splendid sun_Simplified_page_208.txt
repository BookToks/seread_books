Mariam, I was upstairs playing with Mariam," Zalmai said.

"And your mother?" "She was downstairs, talking to that man." "I see," said Rasheed. "Teamwork." Mariam watched his face relax and soften. The lines on his forehead disappeared.

The suspicion in his eyes went away. He sat up straight and, for a moment, looked like a captain thinking carefully about what to do next.

He looked up.

Mariam started to say something, but he raised his hand and, without looking at her, said, "It's too late, Mariam." To Zalmai, he said coldly, "You're going upstairs, boy." Mariam saw worry on Zalmai’s face. He looked nervously at all three of them.

He now realized that his tattling had brought something serious for adults into the room.

He glanced sadly and regretfully at Mariam, then at his mother.

Rasheed said in a firm voice, "Now!" He grabbed Zalmai’s elbow. Zalmai quietly let himself be led upstairs.

Mariam and Laila stood still, looking at the ground. It felt like if they looked at each other, it would prove Rasheed’s strange thoughts right—that while he was helping people who ignored him, a secret plan was happening behind his back, in his home, with his own son there. Neither of them said a word. They listened to footsteps above—the heavy one and the light, nervous one. They heard quiet talking, a small scared voice, a sharp reply, a door closing, and a key turning in the lock. Then one set of footsteps came back, faster now.

Mariam saw his feet pounding down the stairs. She saw him put the key in his pocket and his belt, the end rolled tightly around his knuckles. The fake brass buckle hit the stairs as he walked.

She tried to stop him, but he pushed her back and passed by. Without saying anything, he swung the belt at Laila. He did it so fast she couldn’t move, duck, or even raise her arm to protect herself. Laila touched her head, looked at the blood, then at Rasheed, shocked. That look only lasted a moment before it changed to hate.
