As daylight slowly took the darkness away that spring morning in 1994, Laila became sure Rasheed knew. She thought he would come and pull her out of bed any second to ask if she really thought he was so dumb he wouldn’t find out. But then the call to prayer sounded, the sun shone on the roofs, the roosters crowed, and nothing unusual happened. She could hear him in the bathroom, tapping his razor on the sink. Then downstairs, moving around and making tea. The keys jingled. Now he was crossing the yard, walking his bicycle.

Laila looked through a crack in the living room curtains. She saw him ride away, a big man on a small bike, the sun shining off the handlebars.

“Laila?” Mariam was standing in the doorway. Laila could tell she hadn’t slept either. She wondered if Mariam had also spent the night feeling both excited and nervous.

“We’ll leave in half an hour,” Laila said.

In the backseat of the taxi, no one spoke. Aziza sat on Mariam’s lap, holding her doll, her eyes big and confused as the city raced by.

“Ona!” she shouted, pointing at a group of little girls jumping rope. “Mayam! Ona!” Everywhere Laila looked, she saw Rasheed. She spotted him coming out of barbershops with dark windows, from small booths selling birds, and from old stores filled with piles of tires.

She sank lower in her seat.

Next to her, Mariam quietly said a prayer. Laila wished she could see her face, but Mariam wore a burqa, like Laila, and all she could see were her eyes shining behind the cloth.

This was Laila’s first time leaving the house in weeks, except for a quick trip to the pawnshop the day before where she had pushed her wedding ring across the glass counter. She had left feeling happy it was over, knowing she couldn’t go back.

All around her, Laila saw the damage from recent fighting she had heard from the house. Houses were in ruins, with no roofs and broken bricks and stones. Buildings had fallen beams sticking out, burned and twisted cars were turned over or piled up. Walls were full of bullet holes, and broken glass was everywhere. She saw a funeral walking toward a mosque, with an old woman dressed in black at the back pulling her hair. They passed a cemetery with piles of rocks as graves and torn flags waving in the wind.

Laila reached over the suitcase and held her daughter’s soft arm.

At the Lahore Gate bus station, near Pol Mahmood Khan in East Kabul, a line of buses waited along the street.
