How could he just leave her? She slapped him. Then she slapped him again and pulled his hair, so he had to hold her wrists. He was saying something, but she couldn’t understand it. He spoke softly and calmly, and somehow they ended up with their foreheads and noses touching. She could feel his warm breath on her lips again.

And when he suddenly leaned in, she did too.

In the next days and weeks, Laila would try hard to remember everything that happened next. Like someone trying to save art from a burning museum, she wanted to hold on to every little detail—a look, a whisper, a moan—to keep them safe. But time is like a fire that burns everything, and she couldn’t remember it all.

Still, she kept these memories: the sharp pain she felt, the sunlight falling on the rug, her heel touching his cold leg, her hands holding his elbows, the upside-down, mandolin-shaped birthmark under his collarbone glowing red, his face close to hers, his black curls brushing her lips and chin, the fear they might get caught, the shock at how brave they were, the mix of pain and strange pleasure, and the many looks on Tariq’s face—worried, kind, sorry, shy, but mostly hungry.

Afterward, they hurried to get dressed—buttons done quickly, belts buckled, hair fixed with fingers. Then they sat next to each other, smelling like each other, faces red, both shocked and quiet, not knowing what to say about what just happened.

What they had done.

Laila saw three drops of blood on the rug—her blood—and imagined her parents sitting on the couch later, not knowing what she had done. Then shame and guilt hit her hard. Upstairs, the clock ticked loudly, like a judge banging a gavel again and again, punishing her.

Then Tariq said, “Come with me.” For a moment, Laila almost believed it could happen. She, Tariq, and his parents could pack their bags, get on a bus, leave all the violence behind, and find either blessings or trouble—but face it all together. The lonely, hard future waiting for her didn’t have to happen.

She could go. They could be together.

They would have more afternoons like this.

“I want to marry you, Laila.” For the first time since they were on the floor, she looked into his eyes. She searched his face. This time, he wasn’t joking. His look was serious and honest.

“Tariq—” “Let me marry you, Laila. Today. We could get married today.” He started to explain more about going to a mosque, finding a mullah, getting witnesses, and having a quick nikka.
