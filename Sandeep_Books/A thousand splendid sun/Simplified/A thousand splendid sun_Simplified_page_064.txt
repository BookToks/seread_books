"Shut up," Mariam said.

It wasn’t easy dealing with him talking to her like that—his mean words, his insults, and how he ignored her like she was invisible. But after four years of marriage, Mariam knew how much a woman could put up with when she was scared. And Mariam was scared. She lived in fear of his mood swings, his quick anger, and how he turned even simple talks into fights. Sometimes, those fights ended with him hitting her, and sometimes he said sorry, but not always.

In the four years since that day at the bathhouse, there had been six more times when hope came and then was crushed. Each loss and trip to the doctor hurt Mariam more than the last. With every disappointment, Rasheed became colder and angrier. Nothing she did made him happy. She cleaned, made sure he had clean shirts, cooked his favorite food. Once, she even bought makeup and wore it for him. But when he saw her, he looked disgusted, and she ran to wash it off, crying.

Now, Mariam was scared when she heard him come home at night. The sound of the key and the door opening made her heart beat fast. From her bed, she listened to his footsteps and the sounds he made.

She paid attention to every noise: dragging chair legs, the squeak when he sat, the sound of his spoon on the plate, flipping newspaper pages, drinking water. Her heart raced as she guessed what excuse he would use to get angry that night. There was always something that made him mad because no matter what she did, it was never enough. She couldn’t give him a son. In this way, she had failed him seven times, and now she was just a burden. She saw it in his eyes when he looked at her. She was a burden to him.

“What’s going to happen?” she asked.

Rasheed looked at her sideways. He made a noise like a sigh mixed with a groan, took his legs down from the table, and turned off the radio. He carried it upstairs to his room and closed the door.

On April 27, Mariam’s question was answered with loud, sudden noises and roars. She ran barefoot to the living room and saw Rasheed by the window, wearing just his undershirt, his hair messy, his hands pressed to the glass. Mariam stood next to him. Above them, she saw military planes flying fast, heading north and east.
