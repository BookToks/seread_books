Mariam had opened the curtain a little and saw him for a moment. Only a quick look, but enough to notice his hair was fluffy white and he was starting to bend over. He wore glasses, a red tie like always, and the usual white handkerchief in his jacket pocket. The most noticeable thing was that he was much thinner than she remembered. His dark brown coat hung loosely on his shoulders, and his pants were too long and bunching at his feet.

Jalil saw her too, just for a second. Their eyes met through the curtain, just like they had many years ago through another curtain.

Then Mariam quickly closed the curtains. She sat on the bed and waited for him to leave.

She thought about the letter Jalil had left at her door a long time ago. She kept it under her pillow for days, picking it up and turning it over in her hands. In the end, she tore it up without reading it.

Now, after all these years, she was calling him.

Mariam felt sorry for being proud and stubborn back then. She wished she had let him in.

What harm would it have done to let him in, sit with him, and listen to what he wanted to say? He was her father. He had not been a good father, but his mistakes seemed small now, easy to forgive compared to Rasheed’s cruelty or the terrible violence she had seen men do to each other.

She wished she hadn’t destroyed his letter.

A man’s deep voice spoke in her ear, telling her she had reached the mayor’s office in Herat.

Mariam cleared her throat. "Salaam, brother, I’m looking for someone who lives in Herat."

"Or he did, many years ago. His name is Jalil Khan. He lived in Shar-e-Nau and owned the cinema. Do you know where he is?"

The man sounded annoyed. "Is this why you’re calling the mayor’s office?" Mariam said she didn’t know who else to call.

"Sorry, brother. I know you’re busy, but this is about life and death."

"I don’t know him. The cinema closed years ago."

"Maybe someone there might know him..."

"There’s no one."

Mariam closed her eyes. "Please, brother. There are children involved. Little kids."

The man sighed.

"Maybe someone there..."

"There’s a groundskeeper here."
