These women confused Mariam. They made her realize she was plain, had no big dreams, and didn’t know much.

Then Rasheed tapped her on the shoulder and gave her something.

It was a dark maroon silk shawl with beads and gold thread around the edges. "Do you like it?" Mariam looked up. Rasheed did something kind; he blinked and looked away.

Mariam thought about Jalil and how he had pushed his jewelry on her in a happy but forceful way, making her feel she had to be thankful. Nana had been right about Jalil’s gifts. They were half-hearted and fake, meant more to make him feel better than to truly please her. But this shawl, Mariam saw, was a real gift.

"It’s beautiful," she said.

That night, Rasheed came to her room again. Instead of standing in the doorway smoking, he sat next to her on the bed. The bed creaked as he leaned toward her.

He hesitated for a moment, then put his hand on her neck, slowly pressing the back of it. His thumb moved down, stroking above her collarbone and then the skin below. Mariam started shivering. His hand moved lower, his nails catching on her blouse.

"I can’t," she whispered, looking at his face in the moonlight, his broad shoulders, and the gray hairs showing at his collar.

His hand was now on her breast, squeezing hard through the blouse. She heard him breathing deeply.

He slid under the blanket beside her. She felt his hand working on his belt and the string of her pants. Her hands grabbed the sheets tightly. He rolled on top of her, moving around, and she let out a soft cry. Mariam closed her eyes and clenched her teeth.

The pain was sudden and shocking. Her eyes flew open. She gasped and bit her thumb. She wrapped her arm around Rasheed’s back and dug her fingers into his shirt.

Rasheed buried his face in her pillow, and Mariam stared at the ceiling, wide-eyed and shivering, her lips tight, feeling his quick breaths on her shoulder.
