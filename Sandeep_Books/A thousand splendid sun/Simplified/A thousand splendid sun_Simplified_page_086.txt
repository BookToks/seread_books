That night, like most nights, Laila set the dinner table for two only. Mammy said she wasn’t hungry. When she was hungry, she made sure to take her food to her room before Babi came home. She was usually asleep or lying awake in bed by the time Laila and Babi sat down to eat.

Babi came out of the bathroom, his hair covered with white flour from earlier, but now it was clean and combed back.

“What are we having, Laila?”  
“Leftover aush soup.”  
“Sounds good,” he said, folding the towel he had used to dry his hair. “So what are we working on tonight? Adding fractions?”  
“Actually, converting fractions to mixed numbers.”  
“Ah. Right.”  

Every night after dinner, Babi helped Laila with her homework and gave her some extra work. This was just to keep Laila a little ahead of her class, not because he didn’t like the school’s work.

Babi thought the communists had done one good thing, even if it was by accident: education, especially for women. The government had set up classes to teach women to read and write. Now, almost two-thirds of the students at Kabul University were women, Babi said. These women were studying law, medicine, and engineering.

“Women have always had it hard in this country, Laila, but they are probably freer now under the communists and have more rights than ever before,” Babi said quietly, knowing Mammy didn’t like hearing anything good about the communists. “But it’s true. It’s a good time to be a woman in Afghanistan. You can take advantage of that.”  

He shook his head sadly. “But women’s freedom here is also one of the reasons some people took up arms.”

When he said “out there,” he didn’t mean Kabul, which had always been more open and modern. In Kabul, women taught at the university, ran schools, and worked in the government. But he meant the tribal areas, especially the Pashtun regions in the south and east near Pakistan, where women were rarely seen outside unless wearing a burqa and always with men.  

In those places, men followed old tribal laws and had rebelled against the communists’ rules to free women, stop forced marriage, and make the minimum marriage age sixteen for girls. Those men saw it as an insult to their old traditions to be told by the government, which they saw as godless, that their daughters had to leave home, go to school, and work with men.
