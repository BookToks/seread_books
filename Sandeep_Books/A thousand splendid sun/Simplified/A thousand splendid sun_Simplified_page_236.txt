Laila has to tell Aziza that when they go back to Kabul, the Taliban won’t be there. There won’t be any fighting, and Aziza won’t have to go back to the orphanage. "We’ll all live together—your dad, me, Zalmai, and you, Aziza. You’ll never have to be away from me again. I promise." She smiles at her daughter. "Unless one day you fall in love and want to get married."

On the day they leave Murree, Zalmai is very upset. He holds tightly onto Alyona’s neck and won’t let go.

"I can’t get him off, Mammy," says Aziza.

"Zalmai, we can’t take a goat on the bus," Laila says again.

But when Tariq sits down next to him and promises to buy him a goat like Alyona in Kabul, Zalmai finally lets go.

They also say sad goodbyes to Sayeed. For good luck, he holds a Koran by the door for Tariq, Laila, and the kids to kiss three times. Then he holds it up so they can walk under it. He helps Tariq put their two suitcases in the car trunk. Sayeed drives them to the station and waves goodbye as the bus starts moving.

As Laila leans back and watches Sayeed disappear through the bus window, she feels doubt. Is it crazy to leave the safety of Murree? To go back to the place where her family died and where bombs just stopped?

Then she remembers two lines of poetry her father said about Kabul: "You can’t count the moons that shine on her roofs, or the thousand beautiful suns hidden behind her walls."

Laila blinks away tears and settles back in her seat. Kabul is waiting.

They need to go home. This trip is the right choice.

But first, they have one last goodbye to say.

The wars in Afghanistan have ruined the roads between Kabul, Herat, and Kandahar.

The easiest way to get to Herat now is through Mashad, in Iran. Laila and her family stay there only one night. They sleep in a hotel and the next morning take another bus.

Mashad is a busy city. Laila watches as parks, mosques, and restaurants with chelo kebab pass by.
