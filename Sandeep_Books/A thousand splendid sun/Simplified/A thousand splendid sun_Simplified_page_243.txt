Laila's eyes suddenly open. She gasps and leans forward. She scares the bat, which flies quickly across the kolba, its wings fluttering like pages of a book, before it flies out the window.

Laila stands up and brushes dead leaves off her pants. She steps outside the kolba. The light has changed a little. The wind is blowing, making the grass move and the willow branches click.

Before she leaves the clearing, Laila looks one last time at the kolba where Mariam had slept, eaten, dreamed, and waited for Jalil. The willows cast crooked shadows on the old walls that move with the wind. A crow lands on the roof, pecks at something, squawks, and flies away.

"Goodbye, Mariam." Without realizing she is crying, Laila starts running through the grass.

She finds Hamza still sitting on a rock. When he sees her, he stands up.

"Let's go back," he says. Then he adds, "I have something to give you."

Laila waits for Hamza in the garden by the front door. The boy who served them tea earlier stands under a fig tree holding a chicken, watching her without showing any emotion.

Laila sees two faces, an old woman and a young girl in hijab, watching her quietly from a window.

The door opens and Hamza comes out carrying a box.

He gives the box to Laila.

"Jalil Khan gave this to my father about a month before he died," Hamza says. "He asked my father to keep it safe for Mariam until she came to get it. My father kept it for two years. Then, before he died, he gave it to me and asked me to save it for Mariam. But she… you know, she never came." 

Laila looks down at the oval tin box. It looks like an old chocolate box. It’s olive green with faded gold designs on the lid. There’s a little rust on the sides and two small dents on the front. Laila tries to open it, but the latch is locked.

"What's inside?" she asks.

Hamza puts a key in her hand. "My father never opened it. Neither did I. I guess it was meant for you."

Back at the hotel, Tariq and the kids aren’t back yet.

Laila sits on the bed with the box on her lap. Part of her wants to leave it closed and keep whatever Jalil wanted to stay a secret.
