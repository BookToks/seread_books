Mariam sat still and watched Laila’s thin fingers tightening her braids in the mirror. Laila’s face was focused. Aziza was curled up asleep on the floor. Mariam had made a doll for her, sewing it by hand. She filled it with beans, made a dress from tea-stained fabric, and made a necklace from tiny empty thread spools strung on a string.

Then Aziza quietly passed gas in her sleep. Laila started laughing, and Mariam laughed too. They laughed at their own reflections in the mirror, tears in their eyes. The moment felt so easy and natural that Mariam suddenly began telling Laila about Jalil, Nana, and the jinn. Laila stood with her hands resting on Mariam’s shoulders, watching Mariam’s face in the mirror. The words came out fast, like a flood.

Mariam told her about Bibi jo, Mullah Faizullah, the embarrassing walk to Jalil’s house, Nana’s suicide. She told about Jalil’s wives, her quick marriage to Rasheed, the trip to Kabul, her pregnancies, the endless hope and disappointment, and how Rasheed turned against her.

Afterwards, Laila sat at the bottom of Mariam’s chair. She idly took a piece of lint out of Aziza’s hair. A quiet moment followed.

“I have something to tell you too,” Laila said.

That night, Mariam didn’t sleep. She lay in bed watching the snow fall quietly.

Seasons had passed; new presidents in Kabul came and went; old wars ended and new ones started. But Mariam barely noticed or cared. She had spent these years in a far-off place in her mind — a dry, empty field beyond wishes and sadness, beyond dreams and broken hopes. There, the future didn’t matter. The past taught her only one thing: love was painful, and hope was a trick. Whenever those two poisonous feelings started to grow in that dry field, Mariam pulled them out and threw them away before they could take root.

But somehow, in the last few months, Laila and Aziza — who, like her, were haramis — had become part of her. Without them, the life Mariam had put up with for so long suddenly felt impossible to bear.

“We’re leaving this spring, Aziza and I. Come with us, Mariam.”

The years hadn’t been easy for Mariam. But maybe, she thought, better years were still ahead. A new life, where she could find the blessings Nana said a harami like her would never have. Two new flowers had started to grow in her life, and as Mariam watched the snow fall, she imagined Mullah Faizullah spinning his prayer beads and whispering to her in his soft voice, “But it is God who planted them, Mariam jo. And it is His will that you take care of them. It is His will, my girl.”
