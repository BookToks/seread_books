Until her belly started to get bigger.

When that happened, Nana said, everyone in Jalil’s family gasped so loudly it felt like the air left Herat. His in-laws promised there would be blood. His wives wanted him to kick her out.

Nana’s own father, who was just a simple stone carver in a nearby village called Gul Daman, disowned her. Feeling ashamed, he packed his things, got on a bus to Bran, and was never seen or heard from again.

“Sometimes,” Nana said one early morning while feeding the chickens outside their small house, “I wish my father had been brave enough to take one of his knives and do the honorable thing. Maybe that would have been better for me.” She threw more seeds into the chicken coop, stopped, and looked at Mariam. “Maybe it would have been better for you too. It would have saved you from knowing what you really are. But my father was a coward. He didn’t have the dil, the heart, for it.” Nana said Jalil didn’t have the dil either, to do what was right. To stand up to his family, his wives, and in-laws, and take responsibility for what he did. Instead, behind closed doors, they made a deal to save face. The next day, he told her to pack her few things from the servants’ quarters where she had been living and sent her away.

“You know what he told his wives to defend himself? That I forced myself on him. That it was my fault. Didi? You see? This is what it means to be a woman in this world.” Nana put down the bowl of chicken feed and lifted Mariam’s chin with her finger.

“Look at me, Mariam.” Mariam looked, even though she didn’t want to.

Nana said, “Learn this now and remember it well, my daughter: Just like a compass always points north, a man’s blaming finger always points to a woman. Always. Remember that, Mariam.”
