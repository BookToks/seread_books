"I wonder if you can help us. Can you do us a favor?" He handed the boy to his wife. He and Laila stepped away.

"What is it, sister?" She felt better seeing his kind eyes and gentle face.

She told him the story she and Mariam had planned. She said she was a widow. She, her mother, and daughter had no one left in Kabul. They were going to Peshawar to stay with her uncle.

"You want to come with my family," the young man said. "I know it's hard for you. But you seem like a good person, and I—" "Don't worry, sister, I understand. It's no trouble. Let me buy your tickets." "Thank you, brother. This is a good deed. God will remember." She took out an envelope from under her burqa and gave it to him. Inside was eleven hundred afghanis, about half the money she had saved for a year plus the money from selling a ring. He put the envelope in his pocket.

"Wait here." She watched him go into the station. He came back half an hour later.

"It's better if I keep your tickets," he said. "The bus leaves in one hour, at eleven. We'll all get on together. My name is Wakil. If anyone asks, I'll say you're my cousin." Laila told him their names, and he said he would remember.

"Stay close," he said.

They sat on the bench near Wakil and his family. It was a sunny, warm morning, with a few thin clouds over the hills. Mariam started feeding Aziza some crackers she had remembered to bring while packing.

She offered one to Laila.

"I might throw up," Laila laughed. "I'm too excited." "Me too." "Thank you, Mariam." "For what?" "For this. For coming with us," Laila said. "I don't think I could do this alone." "You won't have to." "We're going to be okay, right, Mariam, wherever we're going?" Mariam reached over and held her hand. "The Koran says Allah is everywhere, so wherever you go, Allah’s purpose is there." "Bus!" Aziza shouted, pointing at a bus. "Mama, bus!" "I see it, Aziza," Mariam said. "Yes, bus. Soon we're all going to ride a bus."

"Oh, the things you're going to see." Laila smiled. She watched a carpenter across the street sawing wood, with chips flying everywhere. She watched cars zoom by, their windows covered in dirt and grime.

She watched the buses sitting by the curb, painted with peacocks, lions, suns, and shiny swords.

In the warm morning sun, Laila felt happy and brave. She had another little rush of joy, and when a stray dog with yellow eyes limped by, Laila leaned forward and petted its back.
