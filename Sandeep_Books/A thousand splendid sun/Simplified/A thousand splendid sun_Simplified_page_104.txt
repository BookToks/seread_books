"His dad has been sick," Laila said. "How old is he now?"  
"I don't know. In his sixties, I think."  
"I meant Tariq."  
"Oh. Sixteen."  
"He's a nice kid, don’t you think?" Laila shrugged.

"Not really a kid anymore, though, right? Sixteen. Almost a man. Don’t you think?"  
"What are you trying to say, Mammy?"  
"Nothing," Mammy said, smiling like she was hiding something. "Nothing. It’s just… Ah, never mind. I better not say."  
"I see you want to say something," Laila said, annoyed by how Mammy was avoiding the point.

"Well." Mammy put her hands on the edge of the pot. Laila noticed she was acting a little fake, like she was about to give a speech. She got nervous.

"It was one thing when you were little kids running around. That was fine. It was cute. But now… now I see you’re wearing a bra, Laila." Laila was surprised.

"And you could have told me about the bra. I didn’t know. I’m disappointed you didn’t tell me." Mammy kept going, feeling like she had the upper hand.

"Anyway, this isn’t about me or the bra. It’s about you and Tariq. He’s a boy, so he doesn’t care about his reputation. But you? A girl’s reputation, especially one as pretty as you, is fragile, Laila. Like holding a mynah bird in your hands. If you let go, it flies away."  
"What about all your wall climbing and sneaking around with Babi in the orchards?" Laila said, happy she thought of something fast.

"We were cousins. And we got married. Has this boy asked to marry you?"  
"He’s a friend, Arqfiq. It’s not like that between us," Laila said, sounding defensive and not very sure of herself.
