"You know I love you, Mariam jo."

In the mornings, they woke up to the sound of sheep bleating far away and the high whistle of a flute as Gul Daman’s shepherds took their sheep to eat grass on the hills. Mariam and Nana milked the goats, fed the chickens, and collected eggs. They made bread together. Nana showed her how to mix the dough, how to light the tandoor oven, and how to stick the flat dough on its walls to bake. Nana also taught her to sew and cook rice with different toppings like turnip stew, spinach, and cauliflower with ginger.

Nana didn’t like visitors much, or people in general, but she made some exceptions. One was the village leader, Habib Khan, a small-headed, bearded man with a big belly. He came by about once a month, followed by a servant carrying gifts like a chicken, a pot of rice, or a basket of colored eggs for Mariam.

Another visitor was an old, round woman called Bibi jo, whose husband had been a stone carver and friends with Nana’s father. Bibi jo always came with one of her six daughters-in-law and some grandchildren. She limped and sighed as she sat down on the chair Nana pulled for her. Bibi jo always brought Mariam something sweet or fruit. For Nana, she first complained about her health and then told long, lively stories about Herat and Gul Daman, while her daughter-in-law listened quietly.

But Mariam’s favorite visitor, besides Jalil, was Mullah Faizullah, the old village Koran teacher. He came once or twice a week from Gul Daman to teach Mariam the five daily prayers and help her read the Koran, just like he had taught Nana when she was a girl. Mullah Faizullah was the one who taught Mariam to read. He patiently watched as she read silently, finger under each word, trying hard to understand the letters. He also held her hand to guide her pencil as she learned to write the letters.

He was a thin, bent old man with a toothless smile and a long white beard that reached his stomach. Usually, he came alone to the house, but sometimes with his red-haired son Hamza, who was a few years older than Mariam. When he arrived, Mariam kissed his hand—it felt like kissing dry sticks covered with skin—and he kissed her forehead before they started the lesson.

After the lesson, they sat outside, ate pine nuts, drank green tea, and watched birds flying between trees. Sometimes they walked together among fallen bronze leaves and bushes, along the stream, and toward the mountains. Mullah Faizullah spun the beads of his prayer rosary as he told Mariam stories in his shaking voice about things he had seen when he was young, like a two-headed snake in Iran or a watermelon he had cut open that had seeds spelling the words Allah and Akbar inside.
