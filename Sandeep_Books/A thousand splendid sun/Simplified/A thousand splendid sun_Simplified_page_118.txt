But Laila was thinking about Mammy, who was stubborn and never gave in, just like the Mujahideen. The air around her felt full of anger and sadness. She was also thinking about Babi, who had given up long ago and looked so sad and weak compared to Mammy.

Sometimes… I feel like you’re all I have, Laila.

This was how her life was, the hard truth she couldn’t escape.

"I’ll ask Kaka Hakim for your hand. He’ll give us his blessing, Laila, I know it." He was right. Babi would agree. But it would break him.

Tariq kept talking, his voice quiet, then loud, begging, then trying to explain; his face hopeful, then upset.

"I can’t," Laila said.

"Don’t say that. I love you." "I’m sorry." "I love you." She had waited so long to hear those words from him. She had dreamed about hearing them so many times. Now they were finally said, and it hurt her.

"It’s my father I can’t leave," Laila said. "I’m all he has left. His heart couldn’t handle it either." Tariq understood this. He knew she couldn’t just ignore her responsibilities any more than he could ignore his. But he kept asking, and she kept refusing, his offers and her excuses, his tears and hers.

In the end, Laila had to make him leave.

At the door, she made him promise not to say goodbye. She shut the door on him.

Laila leaned against the door, shaking as his fists hit it. One arm held her belly, and her hand covered her mouth while he spoke through the door, promising he would come back for her. She stayed there until he got tired and stopped, then she listened to his uneven footsteps fading away, until everything was quiet except for the gunfire in the hills and her own heart beating hard in her chest, her eyes, her bones.
