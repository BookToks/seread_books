You're not stupid, Khala Mariam. And Kaka Zaman says that sometimes, the rocks move deep underground. It's really strong and scary down there, but on the surface, we only feel a small shake. Just a little shake.

Last time we visited, Aziza explained that oxygen in the air makes the sky look blue by scattering the sunlight. She said if the earth didn’t have air, the sky would be completely black and the sun would just be a bright star in the dark.

“Is Aziza coming home with us this time?” Zalmai asked.

“Soon, my love,” Laila said. “Soon.” She watched him walk away, moving like his father, bent forward with his toes turned in.

He went to the swings, pushed an empty seat, then sat on the ground, pulling weeds from a crack.

Did you know water leaves the tree by turning into vapor, like laundry drying on a line? That’s how water moves up the tree—from the ground, through the roots, up the trunk, into the branches, and finally the leaves. It’s called transpiration.

Laila often wondered what the Taliban would do if they found out about Kaka Zaman’s secret lessons.

When Aziza visited, she didn’t like silence. She talked a lot in a high, loud voice. Her topics jumped all over, and her hands moved nervously, which wasn’t like her at all. She had a new kind of laugh—more like a nervous sound to make people feel better.

There were other changes too. Laila noticed dirt under Aziza’s fingernails, and Aziza would hide her hands under her legs when she saw Laila looking. If a kid nearby cried or walked by with a dirty bottom and messy hair, Aziza’s eyelids would flutter, and she’d quickly make excuses. She seemed embarrassed about the mess around her, like a host worried about her dirty house and kids.

When asked how she was doing, Aziza gave vague but happy answers.

“Doing fine, Khala,” she said.

“Do kids pick on you?”

“No, Mammy. Everyone is nice.”

“Are you eating?”
