So she let him kiss her, and when he pulled back she kissed him too, her heart beating fast, her face feeling warm, and a strong feeling burning inside her.

In June 1992, there was heavy fighting in West Kabul between two groups: the Pashtun forces led by the warlord Sayyaf and the Hazaras from the Wahdat faction. The fighting destroyed power lines and buildings. Laila heard that Pashtun fighters were attacking Hazara homes, breaking in and killing whole families. The Hazaras were fighting back by kidnapping Pashtun people, hurting Pashtun girls, attacking Pashtun neighborhoods, and killing anyone they could. Every day, bodies were found tied to trees, sometimes burned so badly they couldn't be recognized. Many had been shot in the head or had their eyes or tongues cut out.

Babi tried again to convince Mammy to leave Kabul.

"They'll work it out," Mammy said. "This fighting won't last. They'll make peace."

"Fariba, all these people only know war," Babi said. "They learned to walk holding a milk bottle in one hand and a gun in the other."

"Who are you to say?" Mammy replied. "Did you fight jihad? Did you leave everything and risk your life? Without the Mujahideen, we'd still be controlled by the Soviets. And now you want us to turn against them!"

"We're not the ones betraying, Fariba."

"Then you go. Take your daughter and run. Send me a postcard. But peace is coming, and I’ll wait for it."

The streets became so dangerous that Babi did something nobody thought he would: he had Laila drop out of school.

He started teaching her himself. Every night after sunset, Laila went to his study. While rockets were fired outside, Babi and she talked about the poems of Hafez and the famous Afghan poet Ustad Khalilullah Khalili. Babi taught her how to work out the quadratic equation, factor polynomials, and draw parametric curves. When he taught, Babi seemed different. Around his books, he looked taller to Laila. His voice was calm and deep, and he didn’t blink much. Laila imagined him as he must have been before, erasing the blackboard smoothly, watching a student’s work, kind and caring.

But it was hard for Laila to focus.

"What is the area of a pyramid?" Babi would ask, but all Laila could think about was how full Tariq’s lips were, the warm breath on her mouth, and her face in his hazel eyes. She had kissed him two more times since the day under the tree, both longer and more passionate, and she thought she was less awkward. Both times, they met secretly in a dark alley where he had smoked a cigarette during Mammy’s lunch party. The second time, she even let him touch her breast.

"Laila?"
