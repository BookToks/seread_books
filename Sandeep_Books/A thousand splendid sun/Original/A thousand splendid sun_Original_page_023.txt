 "I'm Jalil Khan's chauffeur," he said, not unkindly.
 
 "His what?" "His driver. Jalil Khan is not here." "I see his car," Mariam said.
 
 "He's away on urgent business." "When will he be back?" "He didn't say." Mariam said she would wait He closed the gates. Mariam sat, and drew her knees to her chest.

 "You need to go home now," he said. "It'll be dark in less than an hour." "I'm used to the dark." "It'll get cold too. Why don't you let me drive you home? I'll tell him you were here." Mariam only looked at him.
 
 "I'll take you to a hotel, then. You can sleep comfortably there. We'll see what we can do in the morning." "Let me in the house." "I've been instructed not to. Look, no one knows when he's coming back. It could be days." Mariam crossed her arms.
