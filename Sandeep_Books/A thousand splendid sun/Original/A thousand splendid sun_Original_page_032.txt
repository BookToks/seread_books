" Mariam's chest was tightening. The room was reeling up and down, the ground shifting beneath her feet.
 
 "He's a shoemaker," Khadija was saying now. "But not some kind of ordinary street-side moochi, no, no. He has his own shop, and he is one of the most sought after shoemakers in Kabul He makes them for diplomats, members of the presidential family that class of people.
