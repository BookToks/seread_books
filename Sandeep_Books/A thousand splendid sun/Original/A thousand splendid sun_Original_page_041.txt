It had a bed, an old, gray brown dresser, a small closet. The window looked into the yard and, beyond that, the street below. Rasheed put her suitcase in a corner.
 
 Mariam sat on the bed.
 
 "You didn't notice," he said He was standing in the doorway, stooping a little to fit.
 
 "Look on the windowsill. You know what kind they are? I put them there before leaving for Herat." Only now Mariam saw a basket on the sill. White tuberoses spilled from its sides.
 
 "You like them? They please you?" "Yes." "You can thank me then." "Thank you. I'm sorry. Tashakor " "You're shaking. Maybe I scare you. Do I scare you? Are you frightened of me?" Mariam was not looking at him, but she could hear something slyly playful in these questions, like a needling. She quickly shook her head in what she recognized as her first lie in their marriage.
 
 "No? That's good, then. Good for you. Well, this is your home now. You're going to like it here. You'll see. Did I tell you we have electricity? Most days and every night?" He made as if to leave. At the door, he paused, took a long drag, crinkled his eyes against the smoke. Mariam thought he was going to say something. But he didn't. He closed the door, left her alone with her suitcase and her flowers.
