The second reason is that adults care for children and others who can't take care of themselves. Neighborhood effects and adults protecting others mean different things for (1) general education for all people to be good citizens, and (2) special job training. The reasons for the government to get involved are very different for these two kinds of education and call for different actions.

One more thing before we start: it’s important to know the difference between "schooling" and "education." Not all schooling is education, and not all education happens in school. The main thing to focus on is education. The government mostly deals with schooling.

GENERAL EDUCATION FOR CITIZENSHIP  
A stable and fair society can’t work unless most people can read and know some basic things, and share some common values. Education helps with both. So, when a child gets an education, it helps not only the child and their family but also everyone else in society.

The education of my child helps you live in a stable and fair society. It’s hard to say exactly who benefits and then charge them for it. That’s why there is a big "neighborhood effect." What should the government do because of this effect? The easiest answer is to make sure every child gets at least a certain amount of schooling. Parents would have to follow this rule, just like building owners and car owners have to follow safety rules to protect others. But there is a difference here. People who can’t pay to meet building or car rules can usually sell their property.
