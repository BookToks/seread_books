Even this idea depends on the government being involved. Property rights are based on laws and social rules. As we have seen, the government’s main job is to decide what these rights are and make sure they are followed. How money and wealth end up being shared depends a lot on the property rules set by the government.

What’s the connection between this idea and another one that sounds fair, which is treating people equally? Sometimes, these two ideas don’t clash. Paying people based on what they produce might actually be needed to treat everyone equally. If we think people have the same skills and starting resources, but some like free time more and others prefer buying things, then making sure they get equal returns from work helps make their overall treatment equal. For example, one person might want a simple job with lots of free time, while another wants a harder job with more pay. If they both got the same money, their real incomes wouldn’t be equal. Also, treating people fairly means paying more for dirty or tough jobs than for easy or fun ones.

A lot of the differences we see in income are like this. Money differences balance out other job factors. Economists call this “equalizing differences” because it makes all the benefits, money and non-money, equal.

There’s another kind of income difference that the market causes, which also helps treat people fairly in a more subtle way. Think about a lottery where everyone starts equal but agrees to join a game with very different prizes. The income differences from the lottery let people make the most of their equal start. If money was shared out again after the lottery, it would be like stopping them from joining the game. This idea is more important than just thinking about real lotteries. People pick jobs and investments partly based on how much risk or uncertainty they like.
