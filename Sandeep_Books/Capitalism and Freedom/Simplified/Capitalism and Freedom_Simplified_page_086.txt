It's better for a person or country to make the things they are really good at and trade for the things they are not so good at making. Tariffs, which are taxes on imports, don’t help Japanese workers live better or protect American workers’ good lives. Instead, tariffs make life harder for Japanese workers and stop American workers from having an even better life.

If we want free trade, how should we do it? Right now, countries try to lower tariffs by making deals with each other. I think this way is slow and not the best. Moving fastest means moving alone. Also, this way makes people think tariffs help the country that uses them but hurt other countries. It looks like when we lower tariffs, we lose something and should get something back from other countries. But actually, tariffs hurt both us and other countries. We would benefit if we got rid of tariffs even if other countries didn’t. Of course, we would benefit more if they also lowered theirs, but we don’t need that to benefit. Our interests work together, not against each other.

I believe it would be much better for us to go to free trade on our own, like Britain did in the 1800s when it got rid of the corn laws. Doing this would give us a lot of political and economic power. We are a strong country, and it’s not right to wait for small countries like Luxembourg to do the same before we lower tariffs on their products. It’s also not right to suddenly put limits on imports from places like Hong Kong and cause many people to lose their jobs. We should take the lead and not just follow others reluctantly.

I have talked about tariffs to keep things simple, but other rules that limit trade might be even more serious now.
