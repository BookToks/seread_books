Economic systems play two important roles in supporting a free society. First, having freedom in the economy is part of overall freedom, so economic freedom is valuable on its own. Second, economic freedom is also necessary to achieve political freedom.

The first role is especially important because many smart people don’t think economic freedom matters as much. They often look down on money and material things and think their own ideas and values are more important. But for most people, economic freedom is just as important as political freedom.

For example, a person in Great Britain after World War II couldn’t spend their vacation money in the United States because of strict rules. This was a loss of economic freedom, just like a person in the United States being stopped from visiting Russia because of their political beliefs was a loss of political freedom. Even though one is about money and the other about politics, both are equally limiting.

Also, if a person in the United States is forced by law to spend about 10% of their income on a government retirement plan, they lose some personal freedom. This kind of loss can feel as serious as losing freedom of religion, which most people think of as a political right. A good example is a group of Amish farmers who refused to pay taxes or accept benefits because they believed government retirement programs took away their personal freedom.
