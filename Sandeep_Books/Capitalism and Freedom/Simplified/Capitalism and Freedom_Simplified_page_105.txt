If parents had more freedom to choose where to send their kids to school, parents who are similar might stick together. This could stop kids from different backgrounds from mixing. Whether this idea is true or not, it’s not clear that these results would actually happen. Right now, where people live already keeps kids from very different backgrounds apart. Also, parents can send their kids to private schools if they want. But only a small group of people can do this, except for church schools, which also causes separation.

Actually, this idea seems to suggest the opposite — that schools might not bring people together. Think about what makes life hard for someone living in a poor neighborhood or a mostly Black neighborhood in a big city. If they want a new car, they can save money and buy the same car as someone in a rich neighborhood. They don’t have to move there. They might save money by living in a smaller place. This is true for clothes, furniture, books, and other things too. But if a poor family has a smart kid and really cares about their education, they have a tough time. Unless they get special help or a scholarship to a private school, they’re stuck. The best public schools are in rich neighborhoods.

The family might be willing to pay extra on top of their taxes to get a better school for their kid.

But they probably can’t afford to move to the expensive neighborhood.

Our ideas about schools still come from a time when small towns had just one school for everyone, rich or poor. Back then, public schools might have given equal chances. But as cities and suburbs have grown, things have changed a lot. Our current school system probably doesn’t give equal chances anymore and might actually make things more unfair.
