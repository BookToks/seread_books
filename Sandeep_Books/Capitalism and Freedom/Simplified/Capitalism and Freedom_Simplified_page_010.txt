My part included a long quote from Capitalism and Freedom, a shorter one from Adam Smith, and ended with an invitation: "Welcome aboard." Even in 1978, out of 25 people who joined the discussion besides me, only 9 agreed with the main ideas of Capitalism and Freedom.

The change in people’s opinions happened because of real experiences, not because of ideas or theories. Russia and China, once admired by smart people, had clearly failed. Great Britain, which influenced many American thinkers with its Fabian socialism, was having big problems. Closer to home, intellectuals who usually liked big government and mostly supported the Democratic party got disappointed by the Vietnam War, especially what Presidents Kennedy and Johnson did. Many important programs like welfare, public housing, support of unions, school integration, federal help for education, and affirmative action were falling apart. Like everyone else, these intellectuals were feeling the pain of inflation and high taxes. These facts, more than the ideas in books about principles, explain why Barry Goldwater lost badly in 1964 but Ronald Reagan won big in 1980—even though both had similar messages and plans.

So, what is the purpose of books like this? I think it’s two things. First, to give people stuff to talk about. As we said in the Preface to Free to Choose: "The only person who can really convince you is yourself. You have to think about the issues calmly, consider different arguments, let them sink in, and after a while turn your opinions into strong beliefs." Second, and more important, books help keep different choices open until the time is right for change. There is a lot of resistance—a kind of control by how things are now—especially in government and private systems.
