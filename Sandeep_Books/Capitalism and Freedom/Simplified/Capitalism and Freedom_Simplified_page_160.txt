The main problem is like what happens with patents and copyrights. It’s about whether people can get paid for the services they provide to others. For example, if I start a business where I certify people, I might not have a good way to make sure you pay me for my certification. If I sell the certification info to one person, how can I stop them from sharing it with others? Because of this, it might be hard to have fair trades for certification, even though people would pay for it if they had to. One way to fix this is to have the government handle certification, like they do for other neighborhood problems.

Another reason for certification is related to monopolies. Certification has some monopoly features because the cost to make a certification doesn’t change much no matter how many people get the info. But it’s not certain that a monopoly has to happen.

Licensing is harder to explain. It goes further by limiting people’s rights to make deals freely. Still, there are some good reasons for licensing that even people who believe in freedom have to accept as proper government action. But, like always, the good parts have to be balanced against the bad. The main reason for licensing is because of neighborhood effects.

A clear example is a "bad" doctor who causes an epidemic. If the doctor only hurts his own patient, it’s just a private deal between them. In that case, there’s no reason for the government to step in. But if the doctor’s bad care causes an epidemic that hurts other people too, then everyone, even the patient and doctor, might agree to only let “good” doctors practice medicine to stop the epidemic.
