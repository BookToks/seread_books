Chapter VI: The Role of Government in Education

Today, formal schooling is mostly paid for and run by government groups or non-profit organizations.

This happened slowly over time and now people don’t really think much about why schools get special treatment, even in countries that mostly believe in free business. Because of this, the government has taken on a lot of responsibility for schools.

Based on ideas from chapter two, the government can get involved in education for two main reasons. The first reason is because of "neighborhood effects." This means that what one person does can cause big costs or benefits to others, but it’s hard to make that person pay for the costs or get paid for the benefits. This makes it impossible for people to trade or exchange things fairly on their own.
