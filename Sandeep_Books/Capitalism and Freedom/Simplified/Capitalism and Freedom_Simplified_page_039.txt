People’s freedoms can sometimes clash, and when that happens, one person’s freedom has to be limited to protect another’s. A Supreme Court Justice once said, "My freedom to move my fist has to stop where your chin begins." The big challenge for the government is figuring out how to deal with these conflicts between different people’s freedoms.

Sometimes the answer is simple. Most people agree that one person’s freedom to kill someone else must be taken away to protect the other person’s freedom to live. But other times, it’s not so clear. In the economy, a big problem comes up between the freedom to join together and the freedom to compete. What does "free" really mean when we talk about "free enterprise"?

In the U.S., "free" usually means anyone can start a business, and existing businesses can only keep out competitors by selling better products or charging lower prices. In other countries, businesses are often allowed to do what they want, like fixing prices or dividing markets, to keep competitors out. The hardest problem is with workers joining together, where the freedom to team up and the freedom to compete really clash.

An even more basic economic issue is about property rights. The idea of property has been around for centuries and is a big part of our laws, so we often don’t think about how complicated it really is. For example, if I own land, do I have the right to stop someone from flying their plane over it? Or does the pilot’s right to fly come first? Does it depend on how high the plane flies or how much noise it makes? If the plane flies over my land, should the pilot have to pay me for it?
