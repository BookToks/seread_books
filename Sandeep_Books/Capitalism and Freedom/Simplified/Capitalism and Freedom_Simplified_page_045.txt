It's hard to tell when neighborhood problems are big enough to spend a lot of money fixing them. It's even harder to decide who should pay for the fixes.

Because of this, when the government tries to fix neighborhood problems, it might cause new problems by not charging people the right amount or paying them back properly. Which problems are worse depends on the specific situation, and even then, it's hard to be sure. Also, when the government steps in, it limits people's freedom in ways that aren't connected to the problem they are trying to fix. This can be a big deal, as explained earlier.

Our rules don't say exactly when it's okay for the government to help with things that are hard to solve by people working on their own. In each case, we need to make a list of pros and cons. Our rules tell us what to include on each side and help us decide how important each item is.

One thing we always need to include on the downside of government action is how it can threaten freedom. We should think a lot about this. How much we worry about it depends on the situation. For example, if the government is already very involved in many things, we might be more concerned about adding even more rules.

This is why many earlier thinkers, like Henry Simons, who lived when the government was smaller, were okay with more government action. But today, when the government is much bigger, many liberals donâ€™t agree with that anymore.
