The Role of Government in Education

If a person improves their skills, they usually get paid more for their work in a free market. This extra pay is the reason people invest time and money in things like machines or education. 

When someone goes to vocational school, the main costs are the money they don’t earn while studying, the interest they lose by starting to work later, and the cost of tuition, books, and equipment. For machines, the costs are building them and the interest lost during that time. People decide to invest if they think the extra money they will earn is worth these costs.

If the government doesn’t help pay for education or tax the extra earnings, then the person or their family pays all the costs and gets all the benefits. This means they usually make choices that are good for society too.

If it were just as easy to get money to invest in people as it is to invest in machines, the returns on both would be about the same.

If investing in machines made more money, parents would spend more on machines for their kids instead of training. But studies show that investing in education often gives better returns than investing in machines.

Sometimes the extra benefits from training are not just money, but also better job conditions. On the other hand, some jobs might have downsides that need to be considered when choosing a career.
