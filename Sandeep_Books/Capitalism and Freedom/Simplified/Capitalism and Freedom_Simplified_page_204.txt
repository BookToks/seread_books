Some people say private charity isn’t enough because the good it does helps not just the people who give money, but also others around them. For example, I feel bad seeing people in poverty and I like when it gets better. But I would feel the same way whether I help or someone else does. So, the good from other people’s charity also helps me.

In other words, we might all want to help poor people if we knew everyone else was helping too. But we might not give as much if we weren’t sure. In small towns, people can pressure each other to give, but in big cities, it’s harder to do that.

If you agree with this idea, like I do, that the government should help fight poverty and make sure everyone has a basic living standard, then the questions are: how much help should there be, and how should it happen? The only way to decide how much is by thinking about how much tax most of us are willing to pay for it. The question of how to help leaves more room for ideas.

Two things are clear. First, if the goal is to reduce poverty, the program should focus on helping poor people, not just farmers or workers or certain groups. The help should be for people because they are poor, not because of their job or age or other group they belong to.

This is a problem with many current programs like farm aid, old-age benefits, minimum wage laws, union laws, tariffs, and professional licenses. Second, the program should work through the market without messing it up or making it harder to work. Things like price supports, minimum wages, and tariffs often cause problems like this.

The best system, based on how it works mechanically, is something called a negative income tax.
