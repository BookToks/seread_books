GOVERNMENT MEASURES USED TO CHANGE HOW INCOME IS SHARED

Governments often use taxes that increase with income, like income tax and inheritance tax, to try to make income more fair. Before talking about whether these taxes are good or bad, it’s important to ask if they actually work.

Right now, we can’t say for sure if they do. What I think, based on what I know, is that these taxes have only made a small difference in making income more equal between different groups of families. But at the same time, they have caused unfair differences between people who are in the same income group. So, it’s not clear if these taxes really make things more equal or less equal overall.

The tax rates look high and increase a lot as income goes up.

But their impact has been weakened in two ways. First, these taxes sometimes make income before tax even more unequal. This happens because taxes can stop people from doing certain jobs that have high risks or other downsides, which then makes those jobs pay more.

Second, these taxes have caused lawmakers and others to find ways to avoid paying them. These are called "loopholes" and include things like special rules for certain types of income or ways to hide money. Because of this, the real tax rates people pay are much lower than the official rates. More importantly, this makes the taxes unfair and random in who they affect.
