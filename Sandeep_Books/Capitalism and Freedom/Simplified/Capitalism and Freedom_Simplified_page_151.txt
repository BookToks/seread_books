Also, these problems give us new ways to use the ideas from the first two chapters.

First, I will talk about the general problem and then a specific example: rules about who can practice medicine. I picked medicine because it’s a field where the rules seem very important. It doesn’t help to argue against made-up examples. I think most people, even many liberals, agree that only people licensed by the state should practice medicine. I agree that licensing makes more sense for medicine than for many other jobs. But I will explain why I think liberal ideas don’t really support licensing, even in medicine, and why licensing in medicine has caused problems.

Government rules that stop people from doing certain jobs without permission are very common. Licensing is just one example of this bigger idea, where the government says you can only do certain work if they say it’s okay.

In the past, medieval guilds were a clear example of groups that decided who could do certain jobs. The Indian caste system is another example.

In the caste system, and to a lesser degree in the guilds, these rules were mostly enforced by social traditions, not by the government.

Many people think the caste system forced everyone to do the job of their birth caste. But economists know this can’t really work because it ignores what jobs people need to do. Actually, the caste system only reserved certain jobs for some castes. Not everyone in those castes did those jobs.
