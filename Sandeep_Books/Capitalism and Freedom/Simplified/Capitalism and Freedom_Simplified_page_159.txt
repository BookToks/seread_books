It’s not really clear if we should try too hard to stop fraud before it happens because it can get in the way of people making their own agreements. But I don’t think we can say for sure that it’s wrong to have rules for some activities that often lead to fraud. For example, registering taxi drivers might be a good idea. A taxi driver picking someone up at night could easily steal from them.

To stop this, it might help to keep a list of taxi drivers, give each one a number, and require that number to be shown in the cab. That way, if something bad happens, the person can remember the cab’s number. This is just using police power to protect people from violence and might be the easiest way to do it.

Certification is harder to explain. Usually, the private market can handle it by itself. This is true for both products and services. There are private groups that check if a person is good at their job or if a product is good quality. For example, the Good Housekeeping seal is a private certification. Some labs test products and say if they’re good. Groups like Consumer’s Union and Consumer’s Research test products for buyers. Better Business Bureaus are groups that check if dealers are trustworthy. Schools and colleges also certify that their students are qualified. Stores help by selling good products, so customers trust them, and stores want to keep that trust by checking what they sell.

However, some people might not get certification as often as they want because it can be hard to keep the certification secret or private.
