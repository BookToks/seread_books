Imagine we pay Japanese exporters with paper dollars. What would they do with those dollars? They can't eat them, wear them, or live in them. If they just kept the dollars, printing dollar bills would be a great way to trade because it would let us get cool stuff from Japan almost for free.

But the Japanese exporters wouldn’t want to keep the dollars. They’d want to trade them for yen, their own money. The problem is, with one dollar equal to 1,000 yen, there’s nothing they can buy for a dollar that they can’t buy for less than 1,000 yen. So why would anyone trade 1,000 yen for a dollar that buys less? They wouldn’t.

For Japanese exporters to swap their dollars for yen, the price of the dollar in yen would have to drop below 1,000. For example, if one dollar equals 500 yen, Japanese goods become twice as expensive for Americans, and American goods become half as expensive for Japanese buyers. This means Japanese products wouldn't be cheaper than American ones anymore.

So, where will the price of yen in dollars settle? It will find a level where exporters who want to trade can exchange their dollars for yen, and importers can use those dollars to buy stuff in America. Basically, the value of what the U.S. sells to Japan will balance with what it buys from Japan. This is a simple way to explain it, ignoring other things like investments or gifts, which don’t change the main idea.

Notice this doesn’t talk about how rich Japanese or American workers are. That doesn’t matter here. If Japanese workers have a lower living standard, it’s because they aren’t as productive as American workers based on their skills, tools, land, and so on. If an American worker is, for example, four times more productive than a Japanese worker, it doesn’t make sense to have the American worker make things where he’s less than four times as productive.
