For fiscal policy, the government should plan its spending based on what the community wants to do together, not just what individuals want to do. It shouldn’t worry too much about keeping the economy stable every year. Taxes should be set to cover the planned spending on average over time, without worrying about yearly ups and downs. The government should also avoid sudden changes in spending or taxes. Of course, some changes are necessary. For example, if the world situation changes suddenly, the government might need to spend more on the military or less. These changes explain some ups and downs in government spending after the war, but not all of them.

Before finishing with fiscal policy, I want to talk about a common idea. Many people think that if the government spends more than it collects in taxes, the economy will grow, and if it spends less, the economy will slow down. This idea is very popular among business people, economists, and regular folks. But it can’t be proven just by thinking logically, there is no solid proof from real data, and the data that does exist actually doesn’t support this idea.

This belief comes from a simple Keynesian idea. Imagine the government spends $100 more but keeps taxes the same. According to the simple idea, the people who get that $100 will have more money. They will save some, maybe one-third, and spend the rest, two-thirds. That means the next group of people gets about $66.67 extra to spend. They will also save some and spend the rest, and this keeps happening over and over. If at every stage one-third is saved and two-thirds is spent, then the original $100 of government spending will eventually add $300 to the total income.
