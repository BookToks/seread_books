Teachers’ pay has been going up much faster than pay in similar jobs. The problem isn’t mainly that we are spending too little money—though maybe we are—but that we aren’t getting much value for the money we spend.

A lot of money goes to fancy buildings and nice grounds at many schools. It’s okay to call this spending on schooling, but it’s hard to say it’s really spending on education. The same goes for classes like basket weaving, social dancing, and other unusual subjects that show how creative teachers are. I want to say parents can spend their own money on these extras if they want. That’s their choice. The problem is using tax money from everyone, including those without kids, for these things. What community benefit justifies using tax money for this?

One big reason this happens is because schools’ money and management are tied together. A parent who wants money spent on better teachers and books instead of coaches and fancy hallways can’t easily make that happen unless most people agree. This shows how markets let people choose what they want, but politics forces everyone to follow the same rules. Also, a parent who wants to spend extra on their child’s education can’t just add money to the public school’s budget or switch to a more expensive school by paying only the difference. If they switch schools, they have to pay the full cost themselves. They can only easily spend extra money on things outside school, like dance or music lessons.

Because private ways to spend more on education are blocked, people push for more public spending on things that are less and less related to the main reason the government is involved in schooling.

This means that changing how schools are run and paid for might lead to less government spending on schools but higher total spending on education overall.
