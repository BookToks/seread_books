Occupational licensure is when the government makes rules about who can do certain jobs, like being a barber. It’s important to understand why these rules exist and what problems they show in politics.

Many states say barbers have to be approved by a group of other barbers. But this doesn’t really prove that these rules help the public. Instead, it shows that groups of workers are more organized and focused on their own interests than the people who use their services.

We all work and also buy things, but we spend more time and energy on our jobs than on shopping. People in the same job, like barbers or doctors, care a lot about their work and will work hard to protect it. But most people don’t get haircuts often and don’t spend much money on barbers. So, they don’t care enough to fight against rules that limit who can be a barber.

The same idea applies to things like taxes on imports (called tariffs). Groups that want special rules care a lot because it affects them directly. The public, on the other hand, doesn’t have a strong, focused interest. Because of this, groups of workers usually have more influence over laws than the general public.

So, the real question isn’t why we have so many unnecessary license laws, but why we don’t have even more. It’s surprising that we still have as much freedom as we do in choosing and doing jobs without too many government rules, both in our country and in others.
