Monopoly has become a much bigger problem in Britain since free trade was stopped, first after World War I and then even more in the early 1930s.

The effects of tax laws have been less direct but just as important. One big part is how corporate and individual income taxes are linked, along with special rules for capital gains in individual taxes. Imagine a company makes $1 million after paying corporate taxes. If it gives all that money to its stockholders as dividends, they have to pay about half of it in income tax. So, they only get $500,000 to spend or save.

But if the company doesn’t pay dividends and keeps the money to invest in itself, the stock becomes more valuable. Stockholders can just hold onto their stock and wait to pay taxes later when they sell it. When they do, they pay taxes at lower capital gains rates, which means they save money on taxes.

This tax system makes companies want to keep their earnings instead of paying them out.

Even if the company’s investments earn less than what stockholders could earn on their own, it can still make sense to invest inside the company because of the tax savings. This can waste money by putting it into less useful projects instead of better ones.

Because of this, after World War II, many companies started doing many different things to use their earnings. It also helps big companies stay strong compared to new businesses. Big companies might be less productive, but their stockholders prefer investing in them rather than getting paid dividends and putting money into new businesses.

Another big cause of labor monopoly has been government help. Rules like licenses and building codes have been one way this has happened.
