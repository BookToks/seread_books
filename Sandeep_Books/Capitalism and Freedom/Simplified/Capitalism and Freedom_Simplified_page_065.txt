Why not look at each situation one by one and decide based on what’s fair? This is like how people say that money rules shouldn’t be set in stone ahead of time, but should be flexible to fit each situation. So, why not think the same way about free speech? Imagine one person wants to talk about birth control on the street, another wants to share communist ideas, and another wants to promote vegetarianism. Why not make a law that either lets each person share their views or stops them? Or why not let a special group decide?

It’s clear that if we decided on each case separately, most people would probably say no to free speech in many cases. For example, if there was a vote about Mr. X talking about birth control, most would likely say no. The same would probably happen for communism. Maybe the vegetarian would be allowed, but that’s not certain.

Now, imagine if all these cases were put together, and everyone had to vote yes or no to free speech for all of them at once. It’s very likely that most people would say yes to free speech for everyone. So, when people vote on everything as one big group, they might choose the opposite of what they would if they voted on each case alone. Why? One reason is that people care a lot more about keeping their own right to free speech when they are in the minority, than they do about stopping others when they are in the majority. So, when they vote on the whole group, they think more about the times they might be silenced than the times others might be silenced.

Another reason, which is more connected to money rules, is that when you look at the whole group together, you see that the rules have long-lasting effects. These effects don’t get noticed or thought about when each case is decided on its own.
