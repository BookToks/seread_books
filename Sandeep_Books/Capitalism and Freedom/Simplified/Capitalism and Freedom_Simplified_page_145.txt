CAPITALISM AND FREEDOM

Groups of businesses sometimes team up to control the market, but this is usually expensive and hard to keep secret. Important laws say that agreements which stop free trade cannot be enforced by courts. In some European countries, courts will enforce deals where companies agree to sell only through a shared agency and pay penalties if they break the rules. In the United States, courts won’t enforce such agreements. This is why cartels last longer and are more common in Europe than in the U.S.

APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENT POLICY

The most important thing the government should do is stop supporting monopolies—both companies and labor unions—and treat them fairly under the law. Both should follow the same rules about breaking the law and interfering with private businesses.

Another key step to reduce monopoly power is to change tax laws. The corporate tax should be removed. If it isn’t, companies should still have to tell their stockholders about profits they keep instead of paying out as dividends. For example, if a company pays a dividend, it should also say how much money was earned but kept in the company. Stockholders would then have to include that amount in their taxes. Companies could still reinvest money, but only if it really helps them earn more than the stockholders could on their own. This change would help businesses grow, encourage competition, and make the economy stronger.
