But there had been big changes in politics, science, and technology. People thought that with a democratic government, new tools, and modern science, we could do much better than in the past.

The way people thought back then still affects us today. Many still believe that any government action is good, blame all problems on the market, and imagine government control working perfectly if run by honest people without outside pressure. People who support less government and more free business still have to defend their ideas.

But things have changed. We now have many years of experience with government involvement. We don’t have to guess about how the market works or how government should work ideally. We can look at how both actually work.

If we do that, it’s clear that the problems with the market are small compared to the problems caused by government actions that don’t work as planned. Who today thinks people have more freedom in countries like Russia, where there is a lot of control and oppression? Marx and Engels once said workers had nothing to lose but their chains and everything to gain. But now, it’s hard to say that workers in the Soviet Union have fewer chains than workers in the US, Britain, France, Germany, or other Western countries.

Let’s think about our own country. Have any of the big “reforms” from past years actually worked? Did the people who wanted these changes get what they hoped for?

For example, rules made to protect train passengers soon helped railroads stop new competitors instead, which hurt customers instead of helping them.
