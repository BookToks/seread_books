The girl who wants to be a movie actress instead of a government worker is basically choosing to take a big risk, kind of like someone who buys super cheap uranium stocks instead of safe government bonds. Insurance is a way people show they want to feel more certain and less risky. 

These examples don’t fully explain how much inequality comes from people’s choices. Even the way people get paid or hired depends on what people like or don’t like. If all future movie actresses really hated taking risks, they might form groups where they share their money evenly to protect each other. If lots of people felt this way, big companies that mix risky and safe projects would be common. Jobs like wild oil hunters or small businesses would be rare.

One way to understand government rules that take money from rich people and give to poor people is to see it as a way to create a kind of lottery that the market can’t. The government tries to spread risk in ways that people want but can’t get on their own. This idea has some truth, but it doesn’t really explain current taxes because taxes happen after we already know who got lucky or unlucky in life. Also, the people voting on taxes usually think they didn’t get lucky.

Maybe it would make more sense for one generation to decide taxes for the next generation, who aren’t born yet. If that happened, taxes might be less extreme than they are now.

A lot of income differences come from people getting paid based on how much they produce, which matches how some people like or don’t like risk. But a big part of income differences comes from what people are born with, like their skills and what they own.
