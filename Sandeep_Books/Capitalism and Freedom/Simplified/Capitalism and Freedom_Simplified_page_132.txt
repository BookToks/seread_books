Competition means two different things. Usually, it means people trying to beat each other. But in the economy, it means something almost opposite.

In a competitive market, there isn’t personal fighting. A wheat farmer doesn’t feel like he’s in a personal battle with his neighbor, even though they both sell wheat. The key part of competition in the market is that it’s not personal.

No one can decide the rules for others to buy or sell things. Everyone accepts the prices set by the market. One person alone can’t change the price much, but all together, everyone’s actions help set the price.
