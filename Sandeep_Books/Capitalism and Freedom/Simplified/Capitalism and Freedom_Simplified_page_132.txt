Chapter VIII + Monopoly and the Social Responsibility of Business and Labor COMPETITION HAS TWO very different meanings. In ordinary discourse, competition means personal rivalry, with one indi vidual seeking to outdo his known competitor. In the economic world, competition means almost the opposite. There is no per sonal rivalry in the competitive market place. There is no personal higgling. The wheat farmer in a free market does not feel himself in personal rivalry with, or threatened by, his neighbor, who is, in fact, his competitor. The essence of a com petitive market is its impersonal character. No one participant can determine the terms on which other participants shall have access to goods or jobs. All take prices as given by the market 120 CAPITALISM AND FREEDOM and no individual can by himself have more than a negligible influence on price though all participants together determine price by the combined effect of their separate actions.
