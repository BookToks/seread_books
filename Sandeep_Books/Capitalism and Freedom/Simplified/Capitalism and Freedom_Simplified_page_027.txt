Specializing in certain jobs and sharing work with others wouldn't work well if we had to keep trading things directly for other things. So, money was created to make trading easier and to let buying and selling happen separately.

Even though businesses and money are important in our economy and cause many problems, the main idea of how markets work is shown clearly in simple trading systems without businesses or money. In both simple and complex systems, cooperation happens only when individuals freely agree to trade. This works if (a) businesses are private, so real people make deals, and (b) people can choose whether or not to trade, making every deal voluntary.

It's easier to say these rules than to explain them fully or to know exactly how to keep them working well. A lot of economic studies focus on these issues. The most important thing is keeping law and order to stop people from forcing others and to make sure deals are kept, which keeps things private. Problems come up with monopolies that limit choices and with effects on others that are hard to charge for. These problems will be talked about more in the next chapter.

As long as people can freely trade, the market system stops one person from messing with anotherâ€™s activities. Buyers are safe because there are other sellers to choose from. Sellers are safe because there are other buyers. Workers are safe because there are other employers to work for, and so on.
