How much of the extra spending will be balanced out? It depends on the people who hold money. One extreme idea, based on a strict money theory, is that the amount of money people want to keep depends only on their income, not on the interest they can earn from bonds or similar investments.

In this case, since the total money supply stays the same before and after, the total money income must also stay the same to keep people happy holding that money. This means interest rates will have to go up enough to stop private spending by the same amount the government spends more. So, in this extreme case, government spending doesn’t actually grow the economy. Money income doesn’t increase, and real income doesn’t rise. All that happens is government spending goes up, and private spending goes down.

I want to warn you that this is a very simple explanation.

A full explanation would need a long textbook. But even this simple idea shows that the result could be anything from a $300 increase in income to no increase at all.

If people are stubborn about how much they want to spend from their income, and businesses are stubborn about how much they want to spend on things no matter the cost, then the result will be closer to the Keynesian idea of a $300 increase. But if people are stubborn about how much money they want to keep compared to their income, then the result will be closer to the strict money theory idea of no income change. Which way people lean depends on real facts, not just thinking.

Before the Great Depression in the 1930s, most economists would have said the result would be closer to no income rise than a $300 rise. Since then, most economists have believed the opposite. More recently, some have started to go back toward the earlier view.
