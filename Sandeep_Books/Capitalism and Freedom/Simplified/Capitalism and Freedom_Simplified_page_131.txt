Virginia has made a plan that is similar to the one talked about in the last chapter. Even though the plan was made to avoid forcing integration, I think the results will be very different. This happens because in a free society, people are allowed to follow what they want, and we can't always predict what will happen.

Right from the start, there have been surprises. I heard that one of the first voucher requests was from a parent who wanted to move their child from a segregated school to an integrated one. They didn’t want to do this to fight segregation but simply because the integrated school was better.

Looking ahead, if the voucher system keeps going, Virginia will be a test to see if the ideas from the last chapter are true. If they are, we should see more schools in Virginia, more variety among them, better quality in the top schools, and later, improvements in the other schools too.

On the other hand, we shouldn’t think that laws can quickly change deep beliefs. I live in Chicago, where laws say schools must be integrated. But the schools are still mostly separated by race, just like in many Southern cities.

There is almost no doubt that if Virginia’s system started in Chicago, segregation would go down a lot, and there would be more chances for smart and motivated Black students.

To be clear, when I talk about the plan from the last chapter, I assume that the rules for schools to get vouchers don’t include whether the school is segregated or not.
