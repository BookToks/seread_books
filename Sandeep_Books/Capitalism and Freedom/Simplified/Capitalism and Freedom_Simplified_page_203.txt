Chapter XII: Reducing Poverty

Western countries have grown a lot economically over the past two hundred years. Because of free businesses, fewer people are very poor in these countries. But poverty is also about how people compare to others, so even in rich countries, many people still live in poverty.

One way to help is through private charity, which means people or groups giving help on their own. In the 1800s, when the government didnâ€™t help much, many private charity groups grew a lot in Britain and the United States. However, as the government started helping more, private charity work has gone down.
