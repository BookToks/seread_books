This difference shows that people don’t spend enough on education and skills.

This happens because the money system isn’t perfect. It’s harder to get a loan for learning than for buying things like machines or buildings. That’s because when someone borrows money to buy a building, the lender can use the building as a backup if the borrower doesn’t pay back the loan. But if someone borrows money to get trained or educated, the lender can’t use the person as backup since people can’t be owned or sold.

Also, the success of the training depends a lot on the person’s effort and choices, unlike a building which works the same no matter who owns it. So, lending money for education is riskier and harder to collect back compared to lending money for physical things like buildings.

Another problem is that loans with fixed payments don’t work well for education because learning is risky. The average benefit might be high, but it can vary a lot. Things like accidents or just being lucky or unlucky affect how much someone earns in the future. If loans were based only on future earnings, many people might not pay back, so lenders would have to charge very high interest rates to cover the risk.
