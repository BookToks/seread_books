As far as I know, no one who supports both socialism and freedom has really dealt with the problem of how to keep freedom under socialism. They haven’t even started to create systems that would allow freedom in a socialist society. On the other hand, it is clear how a free market capitalist society supports freedom.

A clear real-life example of these ideas is the experience of Winston Churchill. From 1933 until World War II started, Churchill was not allowed to speak on British radio, which was controlled by the government through the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). Churchill was an important person—he was a Member of Parliament and a former government minister—who was trying hard to warn people about the danger of Hitler’s Germany. But he wasn’t allowed to speak on the radio because the BBC was a government monopoly and his views were seen as too “controversial.”

Another example comes from a 1959 issue of Time magazine, about the “Blacklist Fadeout.” The Oscars are Hollywood’s biggest event for showing respect to filmmakers, but two years before 1959, there was a problem. When the top writer for the movie The Brave One was announced as Robert Rich, no one knew who he really was. Robert Rich was a fake name hiding one of about 150 writers who had been blacklisted since 1947 for being suspected Communists or supporters of Communism. This was embarrassing because the Oscars didn’t allow any Communist or people who refused to answer questions about Communism to compete.

Last week, both the Communist rule and the mystery of Robert Rich were suddenly changed.

It turned out that Robert Rich was really Dalton Trumbo, one of the original “Hollywood Ten” writers who refused to testify in 1947 about Communism in the movie industry. Producer Frank King, who had earlier said Robert Rich was “a young guy in Spain with a beard,” said, “We have to give our stockholders the best script we can. Trumbo wrote The Brave One and we bought it.”

This basically ended the Hollywood blacklist officially. But for blacklisted writers, the blacklist had unofficially ended a long time ago. It is reported that at least 15% of current Hollywood movies are written by blacklisted writers.
