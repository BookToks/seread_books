Many people think that floating exchange rates cause a lot of problems.

But supporting floating exchange rates doesn’t mean liking unstable rates. We want prices to be free to change, but not jump around wildly. Prices should move within a normal range because the things that affect them are steady. This idea is the same for floating exchange rates. The goal is to have exchange rates that can change but stay mostly stable because the economy is steady. If exchange rates are unstable, it shows there are problems in the economy. Just freezing exchange rates won’t fix these problems and can make things harder to adjust.

To have a truly free market in gold and foreign exchange, the U.S. should take some clear steps.

1. The U.S. should say it won’t promise to buy or sell gold at a fixed price anymore.

2. Laws that stop people from owning or trading gold should be removed. This way, gold’s price can change freely compared to other things or money.

3. The law that requires the Reserve System to keep gold certificates equal to 25% of its liabilities should be removed.
