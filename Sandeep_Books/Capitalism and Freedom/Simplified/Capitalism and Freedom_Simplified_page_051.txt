These arguments are really confusing and wrong. The Great Depression, like most times when lots of people are out of work, happened because the government messed up, not because the private economy is unstable. A government agency called the Federal Reserve System was in charge of money policy. In 1930 and 1931, they did a bad job and turned what could have been a small problem into a huge disaster (you can read more about this on pages 45-50). 

Even today, government actions are the biggest problems for economic growth in the U.S. Things like tariffs and trade restrictions, high taxes, complicated tax rules, government agencies, controls on prices and wages, and other rules make people waste resources and make bad investments. What we really need for the economy to be stable and grow is less government control, not more.

But even with less government control, the government still has an important job. It should help keep the money system stable in a free economy, which is part of making sure the legal system is steady.

The government should also create a fair legal and economic system that lets people grow the economy if they want to.

The main government policies that affect economic stability are money policy and budget policy. This chapter talks about money policy inside the country. The next chapter talks about international money rules, and chapter five talks about budget policy.

Our goal in this chapter and the next is to find a middle ground between two ideas, both of which have problems but also some good points. One idea is that a pure gold standard that works automatically is the best way to solve economic problems and help people and countries work together in a stable way.
