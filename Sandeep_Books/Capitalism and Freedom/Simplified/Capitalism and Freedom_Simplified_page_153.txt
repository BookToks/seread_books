When people ask the government to make certain jobs require a special license, they usually say it’s to protect the public.

But most of the time, it’s not the public asking for this. Instead, it’s the people who already work in that job who want the license rules. They know how they might take advantage of customers, so they might say they know best.

Also, the groups that decide who gets the license are usually made up of people who already work in that job. For example, if plumbing is a job that needs a license, plumbers themselves decide who gets it. This makes sense because only plumbers really know who has the right skills.

Gellhorn says that 75% of these licensing boards are made up only of people who already have the license. These people usually work part-time on the board and might have a financial interest in the decisions they make about who can get licensed and what rules they must follow.

More importantly, these board members usually represent organized groups from their job. These groups often pick who gets nominated to the board, and the government usually just agrees. Sometimes, the group even chooses the board members directly, like with embalmers in North Carolina.
