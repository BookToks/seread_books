Luckily, technical reasons that make monopoly likely only happen in a few areas.

These wouldn’t really harm a free economy if rules made for these cases didn’t spread to other areas where they aren’t needed.

2. Direct and Indirect Government Help

The biggest cause of monopoly power is government help, both direct and indirect. There are many examples of direct help mentioned before. Indirect help happens when the government does things for other reasons but they end up making it harder for new companies to compete with old ones.

Three clear examples are tariffs, tax laws, and rules about labor disputes.

Tariffs are taxes on imports meant to protect local businesses by making it harder for outside companies to compete. This stops people from freely trading what they want. A person who believes in freedom cares about individuals, not countries. So stopping people from the U.S. and Switzerland from trading is just as wrong as stopping two Americans from trading. Tariffs don’t always cause monopolies though. If the local market is big enough and conditions are right, many companies can still compete, like in U.S. textiles. But tariffs do help monopolies. It’s easier for a few companies to work together to set prices than for many companies. It’s also easier when those companies are in the same country. In the 1800s and early 1900s, Britain avoided big monopolies because it had free trade, even though its market was small and companies were big.
