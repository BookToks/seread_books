But we can't pretend that problems are easier than they really are. We have to accept that some control or guidance is necessary. As Dicey said in 1914 about a law protecting people with mental disabilities, "The Mental Deficiency Act is the first step on a path no sane person can avoid, but if taken too far, it will cause leaders to face tough choices that might limit personal freedom."

There’s no exact rule to tell us when to stop. We have to use our imperfect judgment and, once we decide, try to convince others that we’re right or listen if they convince us to change our minds. We have to trust that people, with their mistakes and biases, can come together through open discussion and trial and error to agree on what’s best.

A government that keeps law and order, defines property rights, helps change those rights and other economic rules, settles arguments about the rules, enforces contracts, encourages competition, provides a stable money system, fights technical monopolies, deals with neighborhood problems that need government help, and supports private charity and families in taking care of those who can’t take care of themselves—like the mentally ill or children—would have important jobs to do. A true liberal is not someone who wants no government at all.

But it’s also true that such a government would have limited duties and would avoid many activities that federal and state governments currently do.
