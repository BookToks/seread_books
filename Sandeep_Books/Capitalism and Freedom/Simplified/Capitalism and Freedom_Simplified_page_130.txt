The practical reasons don’t seem strong enough to beat the main problem.

SEGREGATION IN SCHOOLING

School segregation is a special problem because schools are mostly run by the government right now. This means the government has to decide to either keep schools separated by race or mix them together. Both choices seem bad to me. People who think skin color shouldn’t matter and want everyone to agree, but also believe in personal freedom, face a tough choice. If you have to pick between forced segregation or forced mixing, I would have to pick mixing.

The last chapter, which wasn’t about segregation, actually shows a good solution that avoids both problems. The best way is to stop the government from running schools and let parents pick what kind of school they want for their kids. Also, we should all try to act and talk in ways that help mixed schools become normal and separate schools become rare.

If we did what the last chapter suggested, different kinds of schools could grow — some all white, some all Black, and some mixed. This would let communities slowly change from one kind of school to another, hopefully to mixed schools. It would stop the hard political fights that cause tension and hurt communities. Just like the market works in general, this would let people work together without forcing everyone to be the same.
