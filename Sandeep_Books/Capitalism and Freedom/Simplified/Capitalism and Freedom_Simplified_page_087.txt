74 CAPITALISM AND FREEDOM impediments to trade than tariffs. We should remove both. A prompt yet gradual program would be to legislate that all import quotas or other quantitative restrictions, whether im posed by us or "voluntarily" accepted by other countries, be raised 20 per cent a year until they are so high that they be come irrelevant and can be abandoned, and that all tariffs be reduced by one-tenth of the present level in each of the next ten years.
 
 There are few measures we could take that would do more to promote the cause of freedom at home and abroad. Instead of making grants to foreign governments in the name of eco nomic aid- and thereby promoting socialism- while at the same time imposing restrictions on the products they succeed in producing- and thereby hindering free enterprise- we could assume a consistent and principled stance. We could say to the rest of the world: We believe in freedom and intend to practice it. No one can force you to be free. That is your business. But we can offer you full co-operation on equal terms to all. Our market is open to you. Sell here what you can and wish to. Use the proceeds to buy what you wish. In this way co-operation among individuals can be world wide yet free.
