There are bigger problems for trade than just tariffs. We should get rid of both tariffs and other limits on imports. A good plan would be to make a law that raises all import limits by 20% each year until they don’t matter anymore and can be removed. At the same time, we should cut all tariffs by one-tenth every year for the next ten years.

Doing this would really help freedom both here and in other countries. Instead of giving money to foreign governments as "economic aid"—which supports socialism—and at the same time limiting the things they make, which stops free business, we could take a clear and fair approach.

We could tell the world: We believe in freedom and want to live by it. No one can force you to be free, that’s your choice. But we will treat everyone equally and openly. Our market is open to you. Sell what you want here and use the money to buy what you want. This way, people all over the world can work together freely.
