Occupational Licensure 145

The third stage is actual licensing. This means you have to get a license from an official group to work in a job. The license isn’t just a formality. You have to prove that you are good at the job or pass some tests to show you know what you’re doing. If you don’t have a license, you’re not allowed to work and could be fined or even go to jail if you do.

The question I want to think about is this: when, if ever, can we say these steps are okay?

There are three reasons why registration might be okay, according to liberal ideas.

First, it can help with other goals. For example, the police worry about violence. After something bad happens, it’s good to know who had guns. Before something bad happens, it’s smart to stop guns from getting to people who might use them to do crimes. Registering stores that sell guns might help with this. But just saying this isn’t enough to say registration is okay. We have to weigh the good and bad sides carefully based on liberal ideas. I’m just saying this might sometimes be a good reason to require registration.

Second, registration can help collect taxes and nothing else. The questions here are if the tax is a good way to pay for government services we need, and if registration helps collect the tax. It might, because the tax is on the person who registers or because that person helps collect the tax. For example, when collecting sales tax on things people buy, you need a list of all the stores selling those things.

Third, and this is the reason closest to our main topic, registration might protect customers from fraud. Liberal ideas give the government the power to enforce contracts, and fraud is when someone breaks a contract in a dishonest way.
