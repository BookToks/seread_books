Differences in how much money schools get can make one place more appealing than another, just like the quality of schools does now. The only extra problem is that there might be more chances for people to misuse the system because families have more freedom to choose where to send their kids to school. People often say it’s hard to manage changes like this, but this is a weak excuse. That’s because the current system already deals with big problems, plus the extra issues that come from running schools as a government job.

The talk so far has mostly been about elementary and high schools. When it comes to college and university, the reasons for having the government run schools are even less strong. For the earliest school years, most people agree on what students should learn—like reading, writing, and math. But as students get older, there is less agreement on what should be taught. This means it’s not right to force everyone to follow what most people want, especially for college-level education. People even question if the government should help pay for higher education since there isn’t a clear common set of values everyone agrees on.

There isn’t really any “technical monopoly” at the college level because students often travel far to go to different schools.

Government-run schools play a smaller role in college than in elementary and high school in the US. But they did grow a lot in importance, especially before the 1920s, and now more than half of college students attend public colleges and universities.
