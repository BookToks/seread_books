The Interstate Commerce Commission started a long time ago, and it used to only deal with railroads. Now, it also controls trucks and other ways of moving goods.

The agricultural program is probably the most famous example. It’s basically a government-controlled group that controls farming.

Other examples include the Federal Communications Commission, which controls radio and TV; the Federal Power Commission, which controls oil and gas moving between states; the Civil Aeronautics Board, which controls airlines; and the Federal Reserve Board, which limits the interest rates banks can pay on certain accounts and stops them from paying interest on others.

These are all at the federal level. But many similar controls happen at the state and local levels too. For example, the Texas Railroad Commission doesn’t really deal with railroads but limits how much oil wells can produce by setting how many days they can run. They say it’s to save resources, but it’s really to keep prices high. The government also helps with this by limiting how much oil can be imported. Keeping oil wells shut down most of the time just to keep prices up is like paying workers to do nothing, which is unfair. But some business leaders, especially in the oil industry, complain a lot about workers being paid for doing nothing, yet they ignore this problem in oil.

Licenses are another way the government creates monopolies at the state level. For example, the number of taxicabs allowed is limited. In New York, a special license to run a cab can cost about $20,000 to $25,000; in Philadelphia, it’s around $15,000. Building codes are another example at the local level—they are supposed to keep people safe, but they are often controlled by local unions or groups of contractors. These kinds of rules are everywhere and affect many different businesses in cities and states.
