16 CAPITALISM AND FREEDOM

Economic power can grow without hurting existing businesses. But political power is harder to spread out. You can have many small governments, but it's tough to have many equally strong political centers in one big country. In one big economy, there can be many rich people.

But can there be more than one really great leader that everyone looks up to? When the central government gets stronger, local governments usually get weaker. Political power seems limited, so if one person or group has both economic and political power, it usually ends up very concentrated. But if economic power is kept separate from political power, it can help balance and control political power.

This idea is easier to understand with examples. First, we’ll look at a made-up example to explain the main ideas, and then some real examples show how the market helps protect political freedom.

One important part of a free society is that people can openly support big changes in how society works, as long as they don’t use force. In a capitalist society, people can openly support socialism. In a socialist society, people should be free to support capitalism. But how can people be free to support capitalism in a socialist society?

To support any idea, people first need to earn money. This is a problem in a socialist society because the government controls all jobs. It would be very hard, like it was in the U.S. after World War II, for a socialist government to allow its workers to support ideas that go against the government’s rules.
