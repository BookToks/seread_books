The Federal Reserve System was the biggest change in how money was managed in the United States since the Civil War National Banking Act. For the first time since 1836, it created a special group responsible for controlling money and trying to keep it stable or at least stop big problems with money.

It’s helpful to compare what happened before and after the Federal Reserve was created—like from just after the Civil War to 1914, and then from 1914 to now, two equal time periods.

The second period was clearly more unstable in the economy. This means money, prices, and how much stuff was made changed a lot more. Part of this was because of two world wars, which caused problems no matter what money system we had. But even if you don’t count the wars and look only at the peaceful years from 1920-1939 and 1947 to now, things were still less stable after the Federal Reserve started.

The biggest problems happened between the two wars, with big economic drops in 1920-21, 1929-33, and 1937-38. No other 20-year time in US history had this many bad economic drops.

This simple comparison doesn’t prove the Federal Reserve failed to help keep money stable.

Maybe the problems the Federal Reserve faced were harder than before. Maybe things would have been even worse without it. But this comparison should make people stop and think before assuming that the Federal Reserve, which has been around a long time and is very powerful, is definitely doing a good job or helping reach its goals.
