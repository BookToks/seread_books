A lot could have been said about public housing before we actually saw how it worked. Now that we have experience, we understand it much better. In real life, public housing has had very different effects than people expected.

Instead of making housing better for poor people, public housing has actually made things worse. More homes were destroyed to build public housing than new homes were created. Public housing didn’t reduce the number of people needing homes. Because of this, more people ended up living in each home. Some families got better homes if they were lucky enough to get into public housing, but this made things harder for everyone else because houses got more crowded.

Private companies helped fix some problems by changing old buildings and making new ones for people who lost their homes. But these private efforts would have happened even without the public housing program.

Why did public housing cause these problems? It’s because the people who wanted the program were mostly interested in it for a short time and in a general way. Once the program started, special groups took control. These groups wanted to clean up bad neighborhoods because they owned property there or because the bad areas were near important business districts. Public housing became a way for them to clear out these areas, which meant destroying more homes than building new ones.
