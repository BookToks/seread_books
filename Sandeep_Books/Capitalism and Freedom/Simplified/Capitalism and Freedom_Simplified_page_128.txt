But the law will likely put him in jail if he follows his beliefs and refuses to hire a Black person for a certain job.

As said before, the right way for those of us who think things like skin color shouldn't matter is to convince others to feel the same, not to use the government to force them to do what we want. The ACLU should be the first to understand and say this out loud.

Some states have passed "right-to-work" laws.

These laws make it illegal to make someone join a union to get a job.

The ideas behind right-to-work laws are the same as those behind FEPC (Fair Employment Practices Committee). Both try to protect freedom in job agreements. One says you can't make race or religion a job requirement; the other says you can't make union membership a job requirement. Even though they are about the same idea, people almost always disagree about them. Most people who support FEPC don't like right-to-work laws, and most who like right-to-work laws don't support FEPC. As a liberal, I don’t support either, and I also don’t support laws that ban "yellow-dog" contracts (which force workers not to join unions).

When bosses and workers compete, there’s no real reason why bosses can’t offer any job terms they want. Sometimes workers prefer things like baseball fields, play areas, or better break rooms instead of more money. So bosses find it better to offer these things instead of higher pay. Bosses might also offer or require pension plans and other benefits. None of this stops people from choosing to work.
