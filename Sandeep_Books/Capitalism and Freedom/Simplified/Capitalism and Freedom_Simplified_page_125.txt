He might just be showing what the community likes. He is, in a way, offering services that customers want and are willing to pay for. Still, he gets hurt, and maybe more than anyone else, by a law that stops him from doing this—that is, a law that stops him from choosing a white clerk instead of a Black one because that’s what the community prefers. The customers, whose choices the law tries to limit, only really feel it if there aren’t many stores and they have to pay more because one store closed.

This idea can apply more broadly. In many cases, bosses are following what their customers or workers want when they make hiring rules that care about things not related to how well someone can do the job. Actually, bosses often want to ignore these preferences if they make things more expensive for them.

People who support the FEPC say it’s okay to stop people from freely making hiring deals because someone who refuses to hire a Black person instead of a white person, when both can do the job equally well, is hurting others—specifically, the group of people who miss out on job chances.

But this idea mixes up two different kinds of harm. One kind is when someone hurts another person directly, like hitting them or forcing them into a deal without permission. For example, someone hitting another person with a weapon. Another example is when a factory pollutes a river. The second kind is when two people just can’t agree on a deal, like if I don’t want to buy something someone is selling, so that person is worse off than if I did buy it. If most people like blues singers more than opera singers, they are helping the blues singers’ success compared to the opera singers’.
