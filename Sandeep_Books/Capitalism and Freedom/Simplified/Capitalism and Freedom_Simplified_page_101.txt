In places where it would work, the government has paid for schooling. It has covered the cost not only for the basic schooling everyone must have but also for extra schooling at higher levels that kids can choose to take. One reason for this is the "neighborhood effects" mentioned earlier. The government pays because this is the only way to make sure everyone gets the minimum education. They also pay for extra schooling because others benefit when smart and interested people get more education. This helps create better leaders for society and politics. We have to think about the benefits compared to the costs, and people can honestly disagree about how much support is fair. Most of us would probably agree that the benefits are important enough to justify some government help.

This idea only supports government help for certain kinds of schooling. It does not support paying for just vocational training, which helps students get better jobs but doesn’t prepare them to be good citizens or leaders. It’s hard to clearly separate the two kinds of schooling. Most general schooling also helps students earn more money — in fact, being able to read and write is valuable in most modern countries. And many vocational classes also help students see the world in new ways. But the difference still matters. Paying for training vets, beauticians, dentists, and many other specialists, which the U.S. government often does in public schools, can’t be justified for the same reasons as paying for elementary schools or liberal arts colleges. Whether there are other reasons to support these will be talked about later.

The idea of "neighborhood effects" doesn’t decide exactly which schools should get money or how much. The biggest social benefit is probably from the lowest levels of school, where everyone agrees on what should be taught. The benefit seems to go down as the level of schooling gets higher.
