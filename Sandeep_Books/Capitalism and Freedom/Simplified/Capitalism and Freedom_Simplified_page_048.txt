Government in a Free Society 35 talks about the United States and similar countries in the West. Later chapters will explain some of these government actions in more detail, and a few were mentioned earlier. But to help understand how a liberal thinks about government, here is a list of things the U.S. government does now that don’t really fit with those ideas:

1. Programs that keep farm prices at certain levels.

2. Taxes on imports or limits on exports, like quotas on oil and sugar.

3. Government controls on how much is produced, like in farming or oil production in Texas.

4. Rent control in places like New York, or rules on prices and wages used during and after World War II.

5. Laws that set the lowest wage or highest price allowed, like limits on bank interest rates.

6. Detailed rules for industries, such as transportation being controlled by the Interstate Commerce Commission. This made sense for railroads at first but doesn’t anymore. Banking is also heavily regulated.

7. Control of radio and TV by the Federal Communications Commission, which affects free speech and deserves special attention.

8. Current social security programs, especially those for old-age and retirement, which force people to spend part of their income on retirement plans and buy those plans from government-run programs.

9. Licensing rules in cities and states that stop people from doing certain jobs or businesses unless they have a special license. This license is more than just a fee anyone can pay to start working.
