I can't understand how this is connected to how well doctors do their jobs. Sometimes, they have tried to make people take the licensing exam in English. One strong example of how powerful the Association is, and how it isn’t really about quality, is a number I always thought was surprising.

After 1933, when Hitler took over Germany, many professionals, including doctors, left Germany and Austria to work in the United States. The number of foreign-trained doctors allowed to work in the US in the five years after 1933 was the same as in the five years before. This wasn’t just a coincidence. The fear of these extra doctors made the rules for foreign doctors much tougher and more expensive.

Licensing is the main way the medical profession controls how many doctors can work. It also controls changes in how medicine is done. The American Medical Association has always been against group medical practices and prepaid medical plans. These ways of working might be good or bad, but they are new ideas that people should be allowed to try. No one can say for sure that the best way to organize medical work is for doctors to work alone. Maybe group practices or corporations are better.

We should have a system where all kinds of medical work can be tested.

The American Medical Association has fought against these new ideas and managed to stop them. It could do this because licensing also controls who can work in hospitals. The Council on Medical Education and Hospitals approves hospitals and medical schools. To work in an “approved” hospital, a doctor usually needs approval from the local medical association or the hospital board. Why can’t hospitals that aren’t approved be set up?
