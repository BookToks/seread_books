Some smart thinkers, who came after the Philosophical Radicals like Dicey, Mises, Hayek, and Simons, were worried that if the government took too much control over the economy, it would lead to loss of personal freedom. Hayek even wrote a book called The Road to Serfdom explaining this idea. They believed that having economic freedom was important for having political freedom too.

After World War II, things looked a bit different. Sometimes, government control over the economy did limit individual freedom. But in some countries, instead of losing freedom, people actually changed their economic policies.

England is a good example. The big moment was when the Labour party made a law called "control of engagements." This law tried to control what jobs people could have. It went against personal freedom so much that hardly anyone followed it, and it was quickly canceled. After this, England changed its economic policy by relying less on government plans and more on the private market. Many other democratic countries did something similar.

The main reason for these changes was that central planning didn’t work very well or didn’t reach its goals. But part of the problem was that central planning clashed with people’s rights, and governments didn’t want to completely ignore those rights. This shift might only be temporary, but it shows how political freedom and economic systems are closely connected.

History alone can’t prove anything for sure. Maybe it was just a coincidence that more freedom happened at the same time as capitalism and market systems grew.
