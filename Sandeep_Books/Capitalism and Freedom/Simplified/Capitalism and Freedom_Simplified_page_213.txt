All of this happened because people worked hard and cooperated through the free market. Government rules usually made things harder instead of better. We managed to get past these rules only because the market is very powerful. The “invisible hand” of the market helped progress more than the government’s “visible hand” caused problems.

Is it just a coincidence that many government reforms in recent years failed and didn’t work out as hoped? Is it only because the plans had small mistakes?

I don’t think so. The main problem with these government actions is that they try to make people act against what’s best for them personally, to help what’s claimed to be the “general interest.” They try to fix conflicts by forcing people to do things they don’t want to do, instead of finding a way to solve the problem or helping people see things differently.

These rules replace what real people want with what others think is good for them. Sometimes, it’s just others telling people what’s best, or the government taking from some people to give to others. Because of this, millions of people naturally try even harder to follow their own goals and live by their own values. This is why these government measures often do the opposite of what they want. It’s also why free societies stay strong and don’t get crushed by government rules.

The interests I’m talking about aren’t just selfish or small. They include all the important values people care about and are willing to spend money or even risk their lives for. For example, Germans who died fighting Hitler were following their own beliefs. So are people who work hard for charities, schools, and religion. Not many people focus on these big interests, but a free society lets them exist fully and doesn’t put them below the more common material goals most people have.
