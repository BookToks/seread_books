134 CAPITALISM AND FREEDOM

Is it okay for people in charge of businesses, chosen by private groups, to make decisions about taxes, spending, and control that affect the whole society?

If business leaders are like public workers instead of employees of their stockholders, then in a democracy, they will eventually be chosen by the public through elections or appointments.

Before that happens, though, their power to make decisions will be taken away from them. A clear example happened in the U.S. in April 1962, when President Kennedy publicly showed anger and threatened steel companies to stop a planned price increase. This showed how much power the government in Washington already had.

This example also shows that if steel prices are a public decision, they can’t be decided privately by the companies.

One part of this idea is that businesses and workers should keep prices and wages low to prevent inflation. But if all businesses and workers tried to keep prices from rising during a time when there was pressure for prices to go up, what would happen? There would be shortages of products and workers, and illegal markets would appear.

If prices can’t be used to control goods and workers, something else has to do it. Could private groups manage this? Maybe for a short time in a small area. But if many important goods are involved, there would be strong pressure for the government to control goods, wages, and how workers are assigned and paid.
