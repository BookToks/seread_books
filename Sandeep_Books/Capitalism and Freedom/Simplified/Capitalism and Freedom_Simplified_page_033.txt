Producer King said, "There are more ghosts in Hollywood than in Forest Lawn. Every company here has used the work of blacklisted people. We're just the first to admit what everyone already knows."

You might believe, like I do, that communism would take away all our freedoms and be against it strongly. But at the same time, you can also believe that in a free society, it's wrong to stop someone from working with others just because they believe in or want to promote communism. Their freedom includes the freedom to promote communism. Freedom also means others have the choice not to work with them.

The Hollywood blacklist was unfair because it stopped people from working through pressure and forced rules. It didn’t work well because the market made it too expensive for people to keep the blacklist going.

Because businesses want to make money, this helped protect the blacklisted people by giving them other job options and encouraging others to hire them.

If Hollywood were run by the government, or if in England jobs were only through the British Broadcasting Corporation, it’s hard to imagine the "Hollywood Ten" or similar people would have found work. Also, it’s hard to think anyone with strong views different from the usual would get a job in those cases.

Another example of how the market helps keep political freedom was what happened during McCarthyism.

No matter what the issues were or if the charges were true, what protection did people, especially government workers, have against unfair accusations? Saying they had the Fifth Amendment would mean nothing if they didn’t have other job options outside the government.
