Why should economic freedom and political freedom be connected? What are the logical links between them? First, we’ll look at how the market is a direct part of freedom, and then how market systems relate to political freedom. This will also help us understand the best economic setup for a free society.

As liberals, we believe that freedom for the individual or family is the most important goal when judging how society is organized.

Freedom, in this sense, is about how people interact with each other. It doesn’t mean much for someone like Robinson Crusoe all alone on an island. Crusoe faces limits and has fewer choices, but freedom isn’t really an issue for him the way it is in society. Also, freedom doesn’t say what a person should do with it; that’s a personal choice. Liberals want individuals to figure out their own ethical problems about how to use their freedom.

So, there are two sets of values for liberals: the ones about how people relate to each other, where freedom is top priority, and the ones about personal choices and ethics when using that freedom.

Liberals see people as imperfect. They think social organization should stop “bad” people from causing harm, as much as it should help “good” people do good things. Sometimes, the same person can be seen as good or bad, depending on who is judging.

The main challenge of organizing society is how to coordinate the economic activities of many people. Even in less advanced societies, people need to specialize in certain jobs to use resources well. In modern societies, the coordination needed is much bigger, to make the most of science and technology.
