The Role of Government in Education

If schools were not run by the government, parents would have more choices for where to send their kids. Right now, parents can send their children to public schools for free, so very few send them to other schools unless those schools get money from the government too. Religious schools don’t get public money but they get help from their own groups and can raise money in other ways. There aren’t many other ways private schools get money.

If parents could use public school money to send their kids to any school, lots of different schools would open up to meet what families want. Parents could show what they think about schools by moving their kids from one school to another more easily. Now, changing schools can be expensive or hard unless they move to a new home or pay for private school. Most of the time, parents can only share their opinions about schools through slow government processes.

The government might be able to give people more freedom to pick schools, but it’s hard because every kid needs to have a school spot.

Like in other areas, competition between schools would probably do a better job of giving families what they want than government-run schools. This might mean religious schools would become less common instead of more.

Also, parents who send their kids to religious schools often don’t want to pay more taxes to improve public schools. Because of this, places with lots of religious schools find it hard to get money for public schools. If better schools need more money, public schools in these areas might not be as good, so religious schools seem better.

Another reason some people say we need government schools is because private schools might make social class differences even bigger.
