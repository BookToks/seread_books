In this situation, even in simple Keynesian thinking, when the government spends $100 more, private spending goes down by $100. For example, the government might spend $100 to build a road that a private company would have built, or the road might mean the company doesn’t need to fix its trucks. The company then has extra money but probably won’t spend it all on new projects. So, government spending just takes away from private spending, and only the extra spending by the government really helps the economy grow. It’s strange that to avoid this problem, the government would have to spend money on something completely useless, like make-work projects. But this idea shows that something is wrong with the simple analysis.

Also, the simple explanation doesn’t say where the government gets the $100 to spend. It treats it the same whether the government prints new money or borrows it. But this actually makes a difference. To separate fiscal policy from monetary policy, let’s say the government borrows the $100, so the total money in the economy stays the same as if the government hadn’t spent it. This is the right way to think about it because the government can increase money supply without spending by printing money and buying government bonds.

Now we have to think about what borrowing does. Let’s assume borrowing doesn’t cause people to spend less, so the $100 government spending is not offset by private spending dropping. Note that when the government borrows $100, it doesn’t change how much money people have overall.

The government borrows $100 from some people with one hand and gives that money to others with the other hand. Different people have the money, but the total amount of money stays the same.
