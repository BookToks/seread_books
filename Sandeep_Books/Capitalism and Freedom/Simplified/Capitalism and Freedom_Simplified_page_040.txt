Or do I have to pay him so he doesn’t fly over it? When we talk about things like royal connections, copyrights, patents, company shares, water rights, and stuff like that, it shows how important social rules are in deciding what property really means. It also shows that having a clear and widely accepted idea of property is often more important than what that idea actually is.

Another tricky area in economics is the money system. We all know the government is in charge of money. The Constitution even says Congress can make money and control its value. There’s probably no other part of the economy where people agree more that the government should be involved. But because we accept this so easily, it’s even more important to understand why the government is responsible. Otherwise, the government might start controlling things it shouldn’t, like deciding who gets what, instead of just handling money. We will talk more about this problem in chapter three.

To sum up, our economy works through people freely trading with each other. This only works because the government keeps law and order to stop people from forcing others, makes sure contracts are followed, defines what property means, enforces those rules, and provides a system for money.

GOVERNMENT ACTION BECAUSE OF TECHNICAL MONOPOLIES AND NEIGHBORHOOD EFFECTS

The government’s job is to do things the market can’t do by itself, like setting and enforcing the rules. Sometimes, the government might also do things the market could do, but because of technical reasons or other problems, it’s easier if the government handles them.
