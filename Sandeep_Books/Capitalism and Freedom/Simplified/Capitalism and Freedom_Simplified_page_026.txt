Millions of people help each other every day, whether it’s to get food or cars. For someone who believes in freedom, the hard part is understanding how people depend on each other while still being free.

There are basically two ways to organize the work of millions of people. One way is through control and force, like an army or a strict government. The other way is by people choosing to work together on their own, like in a market.

Working together by choice only works if both sides in a deal get something good from it. This means the deal is fair and both people know what they’re getting.

Because of this, people can coordinate without forcing each other. A good example of this is a free market economy, or what we call competitive capitalism.

In this kind of society, there are many independent families, kind of like a group of Robinson Crusoes. Each family uses what it has to make things or provide services, then trades with other families. This way, they get what they want by making stuff for others instead of just making everything for themselves.

The reason for doing this is that people can make more and better things by focusing on what they do best and trading with others. Since a family can always make things on its own, it will only trade if it benefits from the deal. So, trade only happens when both sides win. This means people work together without any force.

If families were the only ones producing, it would be hard to specialize a lot. But in today’s world, we have businesses that help connect people who sell things with those who buy them.
