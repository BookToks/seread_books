Price controls, whether set by law or agreed on voluntarily, if strictly enforced would eventually destroy the free market system and replace it with a system controlled by the government. Also, they wouldn’t even stop prices from going up. History shows that the average prices and wages depend on how much money is in the economy, not on how greedy business owners or workers are. Governments ask businesses and workers to control themselves because they can’t manage their own money system well and people naturally try to avoid responsibility.

I want to talk about one topic related to social responsibility that affects me personally. Some people say businesses should help support charities and especially universities. But giving money this way is not the right use of business funds in a free market society.

A corporation belongs to its stockholders, the people who own it. If a corporation donates money, it stops each stockholder from deciding for themselves how to use their own money. Because of corporate taxes and tax deductions for donations, stockholders might want the corporation to give money for them since it lets them give more. The best fix would be to get rid of corporate taxes. But until that happens, there’s no good reason to allow tax deductions for corporate donations to charities or schools. These donations should come from the individual owners, not the corporation.

People who want more tax deductions for corporate donations say it’s good for free enterprise, but they are actually hurting their own interests. Many people complain that modern business separates ownership from control—that corporations act like their own law with bosses who don’t care about the owners. This is not true. But allowing corporations to make charitable donations with tax breaks moves us closer to that problem and weakens the basic nature of our society.
