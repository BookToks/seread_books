A few quick calculations show that this new idea could cost way less money and need less government involvement than the welfare programs we have now. Or, you could see these numbers as proof that our current programs waste a lot of money when trying to help poor people.

In 1961, the government spent about $33 billion (federal, state, and local) on different welfare payments and programs. These included things like old age help, social security, aid for kids who need it, general support, farm price help, public housing, and more. I didn’t count veterans’ benefits in this number. Also, I didn’t include costs from things like minimum wage laws, tariffs, licenses, or health activities like hospitals and mental health care.

There are around 57 million people or families in the U.S. The $33 billion spent in 1961 could have been given as cash grants of nearly $6,000 to each person or family in the poorest 10%. This amount would have made their income higher than the average for everyone else.

Or, that money could have given almost $3,000 each to the poorest 20%. Even if we gave it to the poorest third, who were called badly fed, badly housed, and badly clothed, the $33 billion could have given them about $2,000 each. That’s about the amount of money that separated the poorest third from others in the 1930s, after adjusting for price changes.
