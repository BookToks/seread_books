To Americans back then, it clearly didn’t seem important. The big argument about silver money in the 1880s, which reached a peak with Bryan’s famous Cross of Gold speech during the 1896 election, showed that many people were unhappy. This argument caused serious economic problems in the early 1890s. People were scared that the U.S. would stop using gold, making the dollar less valuable compared to other countries’ money. Because of this, people lost trust in the dollar and moved their money out of the country, which caused prices to drop at home.

There were several financial crises in 1873, 1884, 1890, and 1893. These made businesses and banks want to change how banks worked. The panic in 1907, when banks refused to give people their money back in cash, made everyone feel the financial system needed fixing fast. So, Congress set up a National Monetary Commission. Their ideas, shared in 1910, became part of the Federal Reserve Act passed in 1913.

The changes in the Federal Reserve Act were supported by all kinds of people—from workers to bankers—and by both political parties. The head of the National Monetary Commission was a Republican named Nelson W. Aldrich, and a Democrat named Carter W. Glass was mainly responsible for the Federal Reserve Act.

The new money system created by the Federal Reserve Act ended up being much bigger than anyone expected. When the Act was passed, most countries still used the gold standard—a system where money was backed by gold. It wasn’t perfect, but it was close to an automatic system. Everyone thought this would continue, so the Federal Reserve’s powers were limited. But right after the Act passed, World War I started, and many countries stopped using the gold standard.

By the end of the war, the Federal Reserve was no longer just a small part of the gold standard system that helped exchange money and watch banks. It had become a powerful group that could decide how much money was in the U.S. and influence financial systems all over the world.
