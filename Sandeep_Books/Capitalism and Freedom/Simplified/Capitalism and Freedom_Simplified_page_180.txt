The Distribution of Income

In a market society, people get paid based on what they produce. This system helps resources go to the right places without forcing anyone. But people will only accept this if they also think it’s fair. A society won’t stay stable unless most people agree on some basic values without questioning them.

Some important parts of society must be accepted as absolutely true, not just useful tools. I believe that paying people based on what they produce is one of these important ideas that most people still accept.

You can see this by looking at how people who don’t like capitalism criticize how income is shared. Even those who don’t support capitalism still believe that getting paid for what you produce is fair.

The biggest criticism comes from Marxists.

Marx said workers are exploited because they make all the products but only get a part of the value. The rest is called “surplus value” by Marx. But this idea only works if you agree with the capitalist way of thinking. Workers are only “exploited” if they have the right to everything they produce. If you believe in socialism, which says people should get according to their need and give according to their ability, then you have to compare what workers produce with their ability, and what they get with their need.

Also, Marx’s argument has other problems. First, he mixes up the total product made by all resources with the extra product made by one resource alone, which economists call the marginal product. Even more confusing, Marx changes what he means by “labor” halfway through his argument. Marx knew capital helped make the product but said capital was just past labor. So, if you say it fully, Marx’s idea is: “All the product is made by present and past labor.”
