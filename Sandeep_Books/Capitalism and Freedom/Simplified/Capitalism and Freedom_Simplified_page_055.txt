Even during the so-called great days of the gold standard in the nineteenth century, when the Bank of England was supposedly running the gold standard skillfully, the monetary system was far from a fully automatic gold standard. Even then, it was a highly managed system. And now, the situation is even more extreme because many countries believe the government should be responsible for "full employment."

My conclusion is that an automatic commodity standard is neither possible nor a good solution for creating money systems in a free society. It is not good because it would cost a lot of resources to make the money commodity. It is not possible because the ideas and beliefs needed to make it work donâ€™t exist.

This conclusion is supported not only by general history but also by the specific experience of the United States. From 1879, when the U.S. started using gold payments again after the Civil War, until 1913, the U.S. was on a gold standard.

Though this was closer to a fully automatic gold standard than anything since World War I, it was still not a 100% gold standard. The government issued paper money, and private banks issued most of the money people used in the form of deposits. These banks were closely watched by government agencies.

Gold, whether kept by the Treasury, banks, or individuals as coins or gold certificates, made up between 10% and 20% of the money supply, changing from year to year.

The rest, about 80% to 90%, was made up of silver, paper money not backed by gold, and bank deposits without gold reserves.

Looking back, the system seems to have worked pretty well.
