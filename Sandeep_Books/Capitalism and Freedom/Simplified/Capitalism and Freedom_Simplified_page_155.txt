The idea that licensing is meant to guarantee skill is kind of unrealistic.  

Sometimes, the rules for licensing are almost ridiculous. For example, barbers have some funny regulations. In some places, barbers have to learn a lot of complicated stuff before they can work. One law said new barbers must study things like hygiene, bacteria, hair and skin science, chemistry for cleaning tools, and even how to cut, shave, dye, and style hair.  

Back in 1929, none of the states required barbers to graduate from a barber school, but they did need to learn their trade by working as an apprentice. Today, most states require barbers to finish over 1,000 hours of classes about things like sterilizing tools before they can start their apprenticeship.  

These examples show that licensing jobs isn’t just a small issue about government rules. It’s already a big problem because it limits people’s freedom to choose what work they want to do. And it might get worse as lawmakers keep adding more rules.  

Before talking about the good and bad sides of licensing, it’s fair to say that Walter Gellhorn doesn’t think we should get rid of licensing completely. He agrees that licensing has gone too far but believes it still has some important purposes. He suggests making changes to stop people from abusing the licensing system.
