Back in the 1930s, the lower third of people made much less money than most do today. Now, less than one-eighth of people earn as little as the lowest third did back then, even after adjusting for inflation.

The programs we have now to help poor people are way bigger and more expensive than they need to be. If we just helped the 20% of people with the lowest incomes reach the income level of the rest, it would cost less than half of what we spend now.

One big problem with the idea of a negative income tax is politics. This system means some people pay taxes to give money to others. Those who get money can vote, so there’s a risk that the majority might start making the minority pay taxes just to help themselves.

Because this plan is very clear about who pays and who gets money, this risk might be bigger than with other plans. The only way to avoid this is if voters are responsible and fair.

In 1914, Dicey wrote about a similar issue with old-age pensions in Britain. He wondered if it was a good idea to let people who get government help still vote for members of Parliament. The answer is mixed. Britain let everyone vote and gave pensions, which led to higher taxes for some to help others. This probably slowed down Britain’s growth and might not have helped even the people receiving aid. But it didn’t destroy Britain’s freedom or its mostly capitalist system. And, more importantly, there have been some positive results.
