Social security programs were made so people could get help as a right, without needing direct handouts. Millions now get social security benefits. But still, more people need direct help, and the money spent on it keeps growing.

There are many examples of government programs that didnâ€™t work as planned. The silver buying plan from the 1930s, public power projects, foreign aid after the war, the FCC, city renewal plans, and stockpiling programs all had results very different from what was expected.

Some programs did work well. Highways crossing the country, huge dams over big rivers, and satellites in space show how the government can use a lot of resources. The school system, though not perfect, has given more chances to young Americans and helped increase freedom. This is thanks to many people working hard on school boards and to people paying high taxes for schools. Laws like the Sherman antitrust laws have helped keep competition fair. Public health efforts have lowered infectious diseases. Help programs have eased suffering. Local governments have provided important services for communities. Law and order have mostly been kept, though some big cities, like Chicago, have had problems with this.

Overall, the record is pretty disappointing. Most new government projects in recent decades have not met their goals. Still, the U.S. has continued to improve. People have better food, clothes, homes, and transportation. Social classes have become more equal, minority groups face fewer disadvantages, and popular culture has grown a lot.
