Capitalism and freedom depend a lot on people being willing to spend money, but sometimes this can slow down the economy. However, just people spending less wouldn’t have caused a total economic collapse. It might have made the slowdown last longer and be worse than usual, but it wouldn’t have been a disaster.

During about the first year, the economy didn’t show any of the terrible problems that came later.

The economy got worse than usual at the start, maybe because of the stock market crash and tight money rules since 1928. But there was nothing different or unusual that would have made the bad times after 1930 certain or very likely.

Looking back, it’s clear that the Reserve System should have acted differently. They should not have let the amount of money in the economy drop by almost 3% from August 1929 to October 1930. This drop was bigger than most other bad times before.

Even though this was a mistake, it was understandable and not the main problem.

Things got much worse in November 1930 when many banks started to fail. People rushed to take their money out, trying to get cash instead of leaving it in banks. This panic spread across the country and peaked when the Bank of the United States failed on December 11, 1930. This was a big deal because it was one of the biggest banks with over $200 million in deposits. Also, its name made people think it was an official government bank, which made the panic worse.

Before October 1930, there was no big cash shortage or loss of trust in banks. After that, the economy kept having money problems and people kept worrying about banks.
