He is proud of shared history and loyal to common traditions. But he sees government as a tool, not as someone who gives special favors or as a boss or god to blindly follow. He believes the country's goals are only what the people agree on and work toward together.

A free person won’t ask what their country can do for them or what they can do for their country. Instead, they will ask, "What can I and my fellow citizens do through the government" to help us take care of our own duties, reach our goals, and most of all, protect our freedom? They will also ask, "How can we stop the government we create from turning into something that destroys the freedom it was meant to protect?" Freedom is rare and fragile. History shows that the biggest danger to freedom is when too much power is held by a few. Government is needed to protect freedom and helps us use our freedom, but when power is held by a few people, it can also threaten freedom. Even if those in power start out good and honest, power can change people.

So, how can we enjoy the benefits of government without losing our freedom? Our Constitution has two main ideas that have helped protect our freedom so far, even though people have sometimes ignored them.

First, government must have limits. Its main job is to protect our freedom from outside enemies and from each other: to keep law and order, enforce contracts, and support fair competition in markets.

Besides this main job, government can sometimes help us do things together that would be hard or expensive to do alone. But using government this way is risky. We can’t avoid it all the time, but there should be strong reasons and clear benefits before we do.
