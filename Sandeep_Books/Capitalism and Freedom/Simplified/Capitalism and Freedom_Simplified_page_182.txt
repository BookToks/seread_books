In less developed countries like India and Egypt, about half of all income comes from owning property. In the United States, only about one-fifth comes from property. Other rich capitalist countries have similar numbers. These countries have more capital than poorer ones, but they also have people with more skills and abilities, so the money from property is a smaller part of their total income. The big success of capitalism isn’t just about owning things; it’s about giving people chances to grow, learn, and get better at what they do. Still, some people criticize capitalism for being too focused on money, and even its supporters sometimes say that this focus is just a necessary part of progress.

Another surprising fact is that capitalism actually causes less inequality than other systems. Over time and across different places, capitalism has helped reduce inequality a lot. Wealth differences are much smaller in Western capitalist countries like the Scandinavian countries, France, Britain, and the United States compared to places like India or Egypt, where society is based on status. It’s harder to compare capitalist countries with communist ones like Russia because the data isn’t very reliable. But if you look at how different the lifestyles are between rich and poor, capitalist countries might have less inequality than communist ones. Even among Western countries, the more capitalist they are, the less inequality there seems to be: less in Britain than France, and less in the U.S. than Britain. However, these comparisons can be tricky because populations are very different. For example, to compare fairly, you might need to look at the U.S. not just against the U.K. but also its former colonies.

Over time, economic progress in capitalist countries has come with a big drop in inequality.
