Right now, hospitals need interns to work properly. Most states say you must have some internship experience to become a doctor, and this internship has to be at an "approved" hospital. Usually, the list of approved hospitals is the same as the one from the Council on Medical Education and Hospitals. Because of this, the rules for getting a license give doctors control over both hospitals and medical schools.

This control helps the American Medical Association (AMA) stop many group medical practices from growing. A few group practices have survived, though. For example, in Washington D.C., some groups won a lawsuit against the AMA using federal antitrust laws. In a few other places, groups have succeeded for special reasons. But mostly, the AMA has slowed down the growth of group medical practices.

It's interesting that the AMA only fights against one kind of group practice — prepaid group practice. The reason seems to be money-related because prepaid plans stop doctors from charging different prices to different patients.

Licensing has been a big part of limiting who can become a doctor. This causes problems, both for people who want to be doctors but can’t, and for patients who want medical care but can’t get it. So, the question is: Does licensing really help by making doctors better?

First, does licensing actually make doctors more skilled?

It’s not clear that it does. There are several reasons for this.

One big reason is that when you block people from entering a field, they try to find other ways in. Medicine is no different. The growth of osteopathy and chiropractic shows that when medicine is hard to get into, people look for other options. These fields partly grew because it’s hard to become a medical doctor.
