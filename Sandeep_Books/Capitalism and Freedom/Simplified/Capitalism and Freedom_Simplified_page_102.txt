Even this idea can’t just be accepted without question. Lots of governments supported universities before they helped pay for elementary schools. Deciding which types of education are most useful for society and how much money should be spent on them is something the community needs to figure out through their political system.

The goal here isn’t to make those decisions but to explain the problems involved in choosing, especially whether these choices should be made by the community as a whole or by individuals.

As we’ve seen, making sure kids go to school up to a certain level and having the government pay for it can be explained by the "neighborhood effects" of schooling. But a third step, where the government actually runs the schools, which is like taking over most of the education system, is much harder to explain or justify. People don’t often talk openly about whether this is a good idea.

Usually, governments pay the costs of running schools directly, so it seems natural to run the schools if they pay for them. But these two things don’t have to go together. Governments could require kids to go to school and pay parents with vouchers that give a set amount of money per child each year. Parents could then use that money to pay for schools they choose, as long as the schools meet certain standards.

These schools could be private businesses that make money or non-profit organizations. The government’s job would be to make sure schools meet minimum rules, like requiring certain subjects, kind of like how health inspectors make sure restaurants are clean.

A good example of this is the U.S. program for veterans after World War II. Veterans got a set amount of money each year to spend on education at any approved school they wanted.
