If a topic touches on something people care about deeply but disagree on, it can cause big problems in society.

Basic values that are very different usually can't be solved by voting. In the end, they are only settled through conflict, not agreement. The violent religious and civil wars in history prove this point.

Using the market a lot helps society by making it okay for people to be different in many activities. The more things the market covers, the fewer political decisions need to be made, so fewer agreements are needed. When fewer agreements are needed, it’s easier to keep a free society.

Getting everyone to agree is the best case, but it’s not realistic. We don’t have the time or energy to make sure everyone agrees on every issue. So, we accept majority rule as a practical solution. The fact that we use majority rule shows it’s just a tool, not a basic rule. How big the majority needs to be depends on how serious the issue is. If the issue is not very important and the smaller group doesn’t mind losing, then a simple majority is okay. But if the smaller group really cares, even a simple majority is not enough. For example, most people wouldn’t want free speech decisions made by just a bare majority. Our laws have different rules for different kinds of decisions. The most important rules are in the Constitution. These are so important that we only make small exceptions to them. When we first agreed on them, almost everyone agreed, and we need almost the same agreement to change them.

The rule to avoid majority decisions on some important issues, which is in our Constitution and other similar laws, and the rules that stop people from being forced to do things, are also made through open discussion. They show that people basically agree on how to make decisions.
