Chapter V + Fiscal Policy

Since the New Deal, a main reason for the government to spend more money has been to stop unemployment. At first, people thought the government just needed to spend money for a short time to get the economy moving again. After that, the government could stop spending.

But when the first spending didn’t end unemployment and the economy got worse in 1937-38, a new idea came up. People said the economy had grown up and there weren’t many new chances to invest money. Even though people still wanted to save money, it was important for the government to keep spending and borrowing money all the time.
