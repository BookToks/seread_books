So, in a free market, people who discriminate will usually be pushed out.

This idea is bigger than you might think. Many people believe that when someone discriminates against others because of race, religion, or skin color, it doesn’t cost the person doing it but only hurts others.

But this is wrong, just like the wrong idea that a country doesn’t hurt itself by putting taxes on products from other countries. For example, if someone refuses to buy from or work with a Black person, they limit their choices. This usually means they pay more or get less for their work. On the other hand, people who don’t care about skin color or religion can often get things cheaper because of this.

As this shows, it’s hard to clearly define discrimination. The person who discriminates actually pays a price for it. It’s like they are paying extra for something they want. Discrimination really just means having a "taste" or preference that others don’t share. For example, we don’t usually call it discrimination if someone pays more to listen to one singer over another, but we do if they pay more to be served by a person of a certain skin color. The difference is that in the first case, many people share that taste, but in the second, most do not. Is there really a big difference between preferring an attractive servant over an ugly one and preferring a person of one race over another, except that we agree with one preference and not the other? I’m not saying all tastes are equally good.

Gary Becker, a smart economist, showed that the problem of discrimination is very similar to the problems countries face with trade and tariffs.
