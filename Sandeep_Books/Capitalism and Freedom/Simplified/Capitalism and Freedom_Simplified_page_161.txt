CAPITALISM AND FREEDOM

People who support licenses usually say it’s because we need to protect ourselves. They think we can’t always pick the right doctor, plumber, or barber because we don’t know enough. For example, to choose a good doctor, you’d have to be a doctor yourself. So, most of us are “incompetent” and need to be protected from making bad choices. This means that as voters, we must make sure only qualified people can work as doctors, plumbers, or barbers.

So far, I have talked about the reasons for registration, certification, and licensing. But all these things also have big downsides for society. I will explain these problems more clearly using medicine as an example, but first, here’s the general idea.

The biggest problem is that registration, certification, or licensing usually ends up helping a small group of workers control the job market. They use the rules to keep others out and make themselves the only ones allowed to do the job. This is called a monopoly, and it is bad for the rest of the public. No matter what kind of rules you make, this problem is hard to stop because the people who want the rules are the workers in that job. They want to make the rules stronger, moving from registration to certification, and then to licensing.

Once they get the license, anyone who doesn’t follow the rules can’t work in that job and will have to find a different one. So, they lose interest in trying to change or break the rules.

The result is that the workers in that job control who can enter, and they create a monopoly for themselves.
