It’s an important fact in history that as capitalism grew, it helped reduce the unfair treatment of certain religious, racial, or social groups in economic activities. These groups were often held back or “discriminated against.”

Puritans and Quakers could move to the New World because they earned enough money in the market, despite facing problems in other parts of their lives.
