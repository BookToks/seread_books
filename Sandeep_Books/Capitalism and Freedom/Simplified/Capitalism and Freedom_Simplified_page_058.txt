I believe, after studying a lot of history, that the difference in economic stability is because of the way money systems were set up. This shows me that at least one-third of the price increase during and just after World War I happened because the Federal Reserve System was created. This price rise wouldn’t have happened if the old banking system was still in place. Also, the big economic drops in 1920-21, 1929-33, and 1937-38 happened because of mistakes made by the Federal Reserve, and these drops wouldn’t have been as bad with the old banking system. There might have been some recessions, but probably not such major ones.

I can’t explain all this evidence here. But since the Great Depression of 1929-33 was so important in shaping how people think about the government’s role in the economy, it’s worth explaining the kind of interpretation that this evidence suggests.

Many people think the stock market crash in October 1929 caused the Great Depression and started it all. But that’s not true. The economy was already at its peak in the middle of 1929, months before the crash. The economy might have peaked then because the Federal Reserve was trying to slow down "speculation" by making money harder to get. In this way, the stock market may have helped cause the downturn. The crash did hurt business confidence, but it wasn’t the main cause of the Great Depression.
