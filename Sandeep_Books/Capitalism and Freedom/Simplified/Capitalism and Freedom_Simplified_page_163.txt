CAPITALISM AND FREEDOM: First, getting a license is how the medical profession controls how many doctors there are.

To understand this, we need to talk about how the medical profession is set up. The American Medical Association (AMA) is one of the strongest trade unions in the United States.

A trade union’s power comes from limiting how many people can work in a certain job.

They can do this by making sure wages are higher than usual. If wages are higher, fewer people can get jobs, so fewer people become doctors. But this way has problems because many people want to become doctors and may not be happy about being left out. A union is better off if it can directly limit how many people start working in the job. This way, unhappy people don’t even get a chance to enter.

The AMA has this kind of power. It can limit how many people become doctors.

How? The main control is when students get accepted into medical school. The AMA’s Council on Medical Education and Hospitals approves medical schools. A school has to meet the Council’s standards to be approved and stay approved. The Council has shown its power before. For example, in the 1930s during the Depression, they told medical schools they were accepting too many students who couldn’t get proper training. After that, every school cut down on the number of new students.

Why does the Council’s approval matter so much? If they were unfair, why don’t unapproved schools just open? The answer is that in almost every state, you have to be licensed to practice medicine. To get a license, you must graduate from an approved school. In most states, the list of approved schools is the same as the AMA’s approved list.
