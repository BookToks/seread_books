During the Civil War in the United States and for about 15 years after, money was not "convertible." This means that if you had a greenback (paper money), you couldn’t exchange it for a set amount of gold from the government. But during that time, you could still buy gold at whatever price the market set or trade British pounds for greenbacks at any price both people agreed on.

Since 1933, the U.S. dollar hasn’t been convertible in the old way. It has been illegal for Americans to own gold or trade it. The dollar hasn’t been non-convertible in the newer sense, but unfortunately, we seem to be moving toward that with some current policies.

Gold’s role in the U.S. money system is mostly old-fashioned. Now, gold is just like any other product, like wheat, and the government supports its price. But there are three big differences in how the government supports gold compared to wheat: first, the government pays the support price to both foreign and U.S. producers; second, it only sells gold at that price to foreign buyers, not to Americans; third, the Treasury can create money to buy gold without needing special approval from Congress, and when it sells gold, it doesn’t count as regular income in the budget.

When the gold price was set at $35 an ounce in 1934, this was higher than the actual market price. Because of this, a lot of gold came into the U.S., and our gold supply tripled in six years. We ended up with more than half of the world’s gold. We collected this gold "surplus" for the same reason we had a surplus of wheat—the government paid more than the market price.
