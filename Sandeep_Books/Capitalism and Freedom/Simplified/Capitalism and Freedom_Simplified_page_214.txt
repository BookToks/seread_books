That’s why capitalist societies care less about stuff than collectivist societies do.

So, why do people who don’t want more government programs still have to prove their point? Dicey explains: "When the government steps in, especially with laws, the good effects are easy to see right away. But the bad effects happen slowly and are hard to notice. Also, most people don’t think about how government inspectors can be bad at their jobs or even corrupt. And few realize that getting help from the government can stop people from helping themselves."

Because of this, most people naturally like government intervention too much. The only way to fight this is if a society really believes in individual freedom, or what’s called “laissez-faire.” So, losing faith in helping yourself is why more laws pushing toward socialism have grown.

Freedom today is in danger from two sides. One is clear and obvious.

It comes from bad people in the Kremlin who want to destroy us. The other danger is trickier.

It comes from good people who want to make big changes quickly. They don’t want to wait for people to change on their own, so they want to use government power to force their ideas and trust they can do it right.

But if they got that power, they wouldn’t get what they want and would create a strict government they’d hate and be hurt by. Having all that power isn’t safe just because the people in charge mean well.

Sadly, these two dangers make each other worse. Even if we avoid nuclear war, the threat from the Kremlin means we have to spend a lot of resources staying safe.
