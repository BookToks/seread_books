This is another way of explaining the goal of freedom talked about in the last chapter.

From this point of view, the market lets everyone agree without making everyone the same. It acts like a system where everyone gets fair representation. But when we use political actions, they often need people to agree on one thing or force them to be the same. Usually, a political issue has to be answered with a simple "yes" or "no," and there are only a few choices. Even when politics tries to represent different groups fairly, it still can’t match the market’s way of representing many people. Also, political decisions usually become laws that apply to everyone, not separate rules for each group. This means political representation often causes problems and breaks people apart. It stops people from agreeing while still being different.

There are some things that can’t be shared differently. For example, I can’t want one amount of national defense while you want a different amount.

For these things that can’t be divided, we can talk, argue, and vote. But once the decision is made, everyone has to follow it. These kinds of issues—like protecting people and the country—are why we can’t just rely on the market alone. We need to use political ways to fix these differences.

Using political ways is something we have to do, but it can make it harder for society to stay united. It’s easier if people only have to agree on a few things they mostly already agree on. But the more issues we try to agree on, the more stress it puts on the fragile connections that hold society together.
