A flat tax where everyone pays the same percentage would mean people with higher incomes pay more money overall for government services. This isn’t unfair because they get benefits too. It would also stop groups from making others pay taxes that don’t affect themselves.

Changing to a flat tax instead of the current system with different rates might seem like a big change. And it is an important idea. But it doesn’t mean the government would make less money or that it would change how money is shared between rich and poor in a big way. Right now, income tax rates go from 20% up to 91%, and people pay 50% on income over certain amounts ($18,000 for singles, $36,000 for married couples).

If we had a flat tax of 23.5% on the income people report now, after exemptions and deductions, it would bring in about the same amount of money as the current system. Actually, it might bring in more money because people would have less reason to hide income or use complicated ways to reduce their taxes. Also, with simpler taxes, people might work better and earn more.

Since the current system with very high tax rates doesn’t bring in as much money as you’d expect, here are some numbers to explain: In 1959, the total taxable income reported was $166.54 billion. The income tax collected, after credits, was about $38.6 billion. If there was a flat tax of 23.5%, it would have collected about $39.1 billion. So, with the same tax credits, the money raised would be about the same as what was actually collected.
