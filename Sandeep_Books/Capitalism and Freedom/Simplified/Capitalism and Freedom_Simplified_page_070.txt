The biggest short-term threat to economic freedom in the United States today—besides the start of World War III—is that we might start using strict government controls to fix problems with paying for things from other countries.

Controlling international trade might seem harmless. Many people who usually don’t like government interference actually support it here. Some business people even see it as part of the "American Way of Life." But these controls can grow and end up hurting free business a lot.

History shows that the easiest way to change a market economy into a strict, controlled one is to start by controlling foreign money exchange. This leads to limiting imports, controlling what’s made inside the country if it uses imported goods or replaces imports, and this cycle keeps going.

Even Senator Barry Goldwater, a strong supporter of free business, has sometimes suggested controlling foreign money exchange to fix the “gold flow” problem. But this “solution” would be much worse than the problem itself.

In economic policy, there is rarely anything truly new. What seems new usually turns out to be old ideas in a new form. But full exchange controls and stopping currency conversions are different and have a clear link to authoritarian control.

As far as I know, these ideas were first created by Hjalmar Schacht in Nazi Germany. Before, when people said currencies were “inconvertible,” it usually meant the government could not or would not exchange paper money for gold or silver at the official rate.

It rarely meant that a country stopped its people from trading money from one currency to another, or from exchanging paper money for coins or gold.
