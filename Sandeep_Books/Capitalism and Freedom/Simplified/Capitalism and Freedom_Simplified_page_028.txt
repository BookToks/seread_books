The market works on its own without anyone controlling it all.

Some people don’t like a free economy because it gives people what they want, not what some group thinks they should want. Most arguments against the free market come from not really believing in freedom.

Having a free market doesn’t mean we don’t need government. Actually, government is important to set the “rules” and make sure everyone follows them. The market helps by cutting down the number of things the government has to deal with directly. Politics usually makes people follow the same rules, but the market lets people choose different things. It’s like voting for the color of your tie and actually getting what you want, even if most people pick something else.

This is why we say the market gives economic freedom. But this idea also connects to more than just money. Political freedom means no one should force others to do things. The biggest threat to freedom is when power is controlled by just one person or group. To keep freedom, power needs to be spread out and balanced. The market stops political leaders from controlling the economy, which stops them from forcing people around. It lets money power balance political power instead of helping it.

Economic power can be spread out a lot. There’s no rule that says new centers of economic power can’t grow...
