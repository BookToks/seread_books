A hard-working and careful man is seen as "deserving," but these traits mostly come from the genes he was lucky (or unlucky) to get.

Even though we say we believe in "merit" more than "luck," we usually accept unfairness from luck more easily than unfairness from merit. For example, a college professor might admire a colleague who wins a lottery but won’t be angry or feel treated unfairly. But if that same colleague gets a small raise and now earns more than the professor, the professor will likely feel upset. This is because luck and fairness both seem random, but a raise is a clear sign of who deserves more.

In a market society, paying people based on what they produce isn’t mainly about sharing out money fairly, but about making sure resources are used well. As said in chapter 1, the main idea of a market economy is people working together by trading voluntarily.

People work with others because it helps them get what they want better. But if someone doesn’t get the full value of what they add, they’ll trade based on what they can get, not what they make. This means good trades won’t happen if everyone doesn’t get what they contribute. So, paying people for what they produce is needed to use resources wisely, at least in a system based on people choosing to work together.

With enough knowledge, maybe forcing people could replace rewards, but I don’t think so. You can move things around or make people be in certain places, but you can’t force them to try their hardest. In other words, forcing people instead of working together changes how much can be done.
