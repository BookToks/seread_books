Employers try to make jobs that fit what workers want and that workers will like. When there are many employers, workers can find jobs that match what they want.

If some workers prefer to work for companies that only hire union members (called a closed shop) and others prefer companies that don’t require that (called an open shop), different kinds of job contracts will develop to match those choices.

There are important differences between laws like FEPC and right-to-work laws. One difference is that unions sometimes act like a monopoly, controlling the workers. Another difference is that federal laws affect unions. In a fair job market, it probably wouldn’t make sense for employers to require a closed shop.

Unions can exist without having monopoly power, but a closed shop usually means the union has monopoly power.

Having a closed shop and a union monopoly doesn’t mean right-to-work laws are the answer. Instead, it means we should stop monopoly power in unions by using strong laws against it.

There is also a problem between federal and state laws. Right now, there is a federal law that applies to all states but lets states pass right-to-work laws if they want. The best solution would be to change the federal law. But no single state can do that alone, even if people in that state want a change. So, right-to-work laws might be the only way to change things in some states, even if it’s not perfect. I don’t think right-to-work laws will really stop unions’ monopoly power, so I don’t fully support them.
