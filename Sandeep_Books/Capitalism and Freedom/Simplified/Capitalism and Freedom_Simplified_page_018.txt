A by-product is basically a way to check and better understand important ideas.

It's really helpful to have a name for the political and economic ideas explained in this book. The right name is liberalism. But sadly, in the United States, some people who don’t like private business have taken that name for themselves. Because of this, liberalism means something very different now than it did in the 1800s or in much of Europe today.

Back in the late 1700s and early 1800s, liberalism was all about freedom and focusing on the individual person in society. It supported less government control in the economy so people could have more freedom. It also supported free trade between countries to help keep peace and democracy. Politically, it pushed for governments where people had a say, less unfair power by the state, and protecting people’s freedoms.

Starting in the late 1800s, especially after 1930 in the U.S., liberalism began to mean something different, especially about the economy. It started to mean relying more on the government than on people or businesses to reach important goals. The focus changed to welfare (helping people) and equality instead of freedom. Nineteenth-century liberals thought freedom would lead to welfare and equality. But twentieth-century liberals think welfare and equality come before or instead of freedom. In the name of helping people and fairness, they support more government control and rules.
