The Role of Government in Education

Loans for education have to have high enough interest to cover the risk of some people not paying them back. But if the interest is too high, it breaks the law and makes people not want to borrow money. 

For other risky investments, investors can buy shares of a company and only lose what they put in. For education, this could mean giving someone money for school in exchange for a part of their future income. If they earn a lot, the lender gets back more than they gave. If they don’t earn much, the lender loses some money.

There is no law stopping people from making these kinds of contracts, even though it’s similar to owning part of a person’s future income, which feels a bit like slavery. These deals aren’t common because they are hard to manage. People move around, it’s hard to check how much they earn, and the contracts last a long time. These problems are worse when the loans are small and spread out in many places. These costs probably explain why private investments like this don’t happen often.

However, another reason might also be important. Even though it’s hard to give fixed loans for education, Sweden has done this often with moderate interest rates. This might be because incomes of graduates in Sweden are more similar than in the U.S. But this is not the full answer, and we need more research to understand why the U.S. doesn’t have a strong market for education loans like this, and if there are easier ways to fix the problems.

Recently in the U.S., private loans for college students have started to grow. This is mostly thanks to United Student Aid Funds, a non-profit that helps banks give loans to students.
