I’m not saying that public schools were definitely better than other options, but back then, there was a much stronger argument for them than there is now. Today, our problem isn’t making everyone act the same; it’s the opposite—we have too much sameness. What we really need is more variety, and the alternative system would do a better job of this than a government-run school system.

Another thing that mattered a hundred years ago was that people didn’t like giving cash directly to individuals (“handouts”). Also, there wasn’t a good way to manage vouchers and check how they were used. Now, with modern tax systems and social programs, managing these things is easier. Without this, running schools directly seemed like the only way to pay for education.

Some parts of the new ideas are already in place in countries like England and France. Many Western countries want these kinds of systems more and more. This is partly because modern government tools make it easier to set up these arrangements.

There would be problems switching from the current system to the new one, but these problems aren’t impossible to solve or unusual. Just like when other industries moved from government to private control, school buildings and equipment could be sold to private companies that want to run schools. This way, nothing would be wasted. Since governments would still run some schools in some places, the change would happen slowly and smoothly. In the U.S. and some other countries, schools are managed locally, which would help test new ideas on a small scale. It might be hard to decide who gets grants from which government area, but this is the same problem we have now when deciding which government has to provide schools for certain kids.
