It is harder for the few talented kids—who are the hope for the future—to get out of poverty when they start off poor.  

Another reason people want schools run by the government is something called "technical monopoly." In small towns and rural areas, there might not be enough kids to have more than one good school, so parents and kids don’t really have any choices. Like with other monopolies, the options are bad: either one private school in control, one private school controlled by the government, or a public school run by the state. This is a tough problem. But this issue has gotten less serious in recent years because transportation is better and more people live in cities now.  

The best solution for elementary and high school education might be a mix of public and private schools.  

Parents who want to send their kids to private schools could get money equal to what it costs to educate a child in a public school, as long as they spend that money on an approved school. This would solve the problem of "technical monopoly." It would also stop parents from having to pay twice for education—once in taxes and once again for private school. This system would let schools compete with each other. Competition would help all schools get better. It would create more variety and flexibility in schools. It would also make teachers’ salaries react to the market, helping public schools decide fair pay and adjust faster to changes in teacher supply and demand.  

Many people say schools need more money to build more buildings and pay teachers better to get good teachers. But this is probably wrong. The money spent on schools has been going up really fast, much faster than the overall income of the country.
