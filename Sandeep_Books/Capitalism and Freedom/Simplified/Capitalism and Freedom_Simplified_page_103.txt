In Britain, some local governments pay the fees for certain students who go to private schools. In France, the government helps pay part of the costs for students in private schools.

One reason people want the government to run schools is because they think it helps teach the same basic values to everyone. These shared values are seen as important for keeping society stable. Just making private schools follow some minimum rules might not be enough to do this. For example, schools run by different religious groups might teach values that don’t match each other or the values taught in non-religious schools. This can make education cause arguments instead of bringing people together.

If you take this idea to the extreme, it means not only should the government run schools, but kids should be forced to go to those schools. Right now, in the U.S. and many other Western countries, government schools exist but kids don’t have to go to them. But since government schools get most of the money, private schools don’t get much or any help. This causes fights, especially in places like France and the U.S. Some worry that if private schools got more money, religious schools would get stronger, making it even harder to teach shared values.

Even though this argument sounds strong, it’s not clear if it’s really true or if getting rid of government control over schools would cause these problems. On principle, forcing everyone to go to government schools conflicts with freedom itself. It’s hard to clearly say where teaching shared values ends and forcing beliefs begins. This line is vague and tough to define.
