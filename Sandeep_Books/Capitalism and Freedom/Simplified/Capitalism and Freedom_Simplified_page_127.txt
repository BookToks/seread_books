Usually, any small group that depends on a big group to protect its interests is not thinking ahead. If there is a general rule that applies to many situations, it can stop big groups from taking advantage of small groups. Without such a rule, big groups will use their power to push their own likes or dislikes, not to protect small groups from being treated unfairly.

To explain this better, think about someone who thinks the current way things are isn’t fair, and believes that Black people don’t have as many chances as they should.

If this person always chooses a Black job applicant when many applicants are about equally qualified, should they be stopped? According to the current rules, they probably should be.

In the area of free speech, which is where these ideas have been tested a lot, the idea is "fair speech" instead of just free speech. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) seems confused because it supports both free speech and fair job laws. One reason for free speech is that we don’t want temporary majorities deciding what speech is okay at any time. We want all ideas to be heard so the best ideas can win, even if only a few people believe in them at first.

The same idea applies to jobs and the market for goods and services. Is it better for temporary majorities to decide who gets jobs, just like they would decide what speech is okay? Can a free market for ideas survive if the market for goods and jobs is controlled? The ACLU will strongly defend a racist’s right to speak about segregation on the street, even if they fight against discrimination in jobs.
