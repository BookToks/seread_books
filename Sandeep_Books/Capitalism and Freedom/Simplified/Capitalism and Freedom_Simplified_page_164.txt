That’s why the rule about getting a license is really important for controlling who can become a doctor. It works in two ways. First, the people who decide who gets a license are always doctors themselves, so they have some say when someone applies for a license. But this control isn’t as strong as controlling who gets into medical school in the first place.

In most jobs that need a license, people can try to get in more than once. If someone keeps trying long enough and in different places, they will probably get in eventually. Since they have already spent time and money learning, they want to keep trying. The license rules only come after training, so they mostly make it more expensive and uncertain to enter the job. But making it harder to get into medical school stops people from starting their career at all. If someone can’t get into medical school, they don’t even get to try for a license. So, the best way to control how many people become doctors is to control who gets into medical school.

Controlling who gets into medical school and who gets a license lets the profession limit how many people enter in two ways. The easy way is just saying no to many applicants. The less obvious but more important way is setting very hard rules for getting in that make most young people not want to try. For example, even though the law only says two years of college before medical school, almost all students have finished four years. Also, medical training has gotten longer and harder, with tougher internships.

By the way, lawyers haven’t been as good as doctors at controlling who gets into law school, but they are trying. The funny reason is that almost all the law schools approved by the American Bar Association are full-time day schools, and almost no night schools are approved.
