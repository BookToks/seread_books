The way money is shared can’t be seen as a rule about what’s right or wrong by itself. Instead, it’s more like a tool or part of another idea, like freedom.

Imagine four people like Robinson Crusoe, each stuck alone on their own island. One lands on a big island with lots of food and things, so he lives well. The other three are on small, poor islands where it’s hard to survive. One day, they find out about each other. It would be kind if the one on the big island invited the others to join him and share what he has. But if he doesn’t, do the other three have the right to force him to share? Many people might say yes.

Now think about a different but similar situation. You and three friends are walking and you find $20 on the ground. It would be nice if you shared it or at least bought them a drink. But if you don’t, do the other three have the right to make you share? Most people would say no. Also, just because sharing is kind doesn’t mean it’s always the “right” thing to do. Should we expect anyone who has more money than the average person in the world to immediately give away the extra to everyone else? Some people who do this are praised, but if everyone had to do it, society wouldn’t work.

In any case, two wrongs don’t make a right. The rich person on the big island or the person who found the $20 isn’t wrong for not sharing, so others can’t just force them to give up what they have. Can we really decide for ourselves when it’s okay to use force to get what we want from others? Most differences in wealth or status happen by chance, and that’s just part of life.
