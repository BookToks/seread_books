China is still far from being a free country, but people in China are definitely freer and better off than they were under Mao. They have more freedom in many ways except in politics. There are even small signs of more political freedom, like some officials being elected in more villages. China still has a long way to go, but it is moving in the right direction.

After World War II, people believed that poor countries needed central planning and lots of help from other countries to develop. But this idea didn’t work well anywhere it was tried. Instead, countries like Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea did really well by using market-based policies. Because of their success, many countries in Latin America, Asia, and even Africa started using market-oriented approaches with less government control. Many former Soviet countries did the same. In all these places, more economic freedom went together with more political and civil freedom, leading to more wealth. Freedom and capitalism have been linked.

A personal note: It’s special for an author to look back on their work 40 years later. I’m happy to see that my book still matters today. If I could change one thing, I would separate freedom into three parts: economic freedom, civil freedom, and political freedom. After I finished the book, Hong Kong showed me that economic freedom is needed for civil and political freedom, but political freedom isn’t always needed for economic and civil freedom. I think the book didn’t talk enough about political freedom, which sometimes helps economic and civil freedom, but other times can get in the way.
