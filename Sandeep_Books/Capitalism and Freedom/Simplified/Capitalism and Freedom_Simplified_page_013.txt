The ideas in this book and many details come from the help of many teachers, friends, and colleagues. I especially thank a special group from the University of Chicago: Frank H. Knight, Henry C. Simons, Lloyd W. Mints, Aaron Director, Friedrich A. Hayek, and J. George Stigler. I’m sorry I can’t mention all the ideas I got from them, but I have learned so much that their thoughts have become a big part of mine.

I don’t want to try to list everyone else who helped me because I might forget someone. But I must thank my kids, Janet and David. They never accept anything just because I say it, so they made me explain things in a simple way. This helped me understand things better and write more clearly. I should say they only share responsibility, not all my opinions.

I have used some material I published before. Chapter 1 is a new version of something I wrote earlier, and Chapter 6 is a revision of an article I published before. Other parts come from my articles and books.

Many writers thank their wives in their books, and for me, it’s really true. My wife put together different parts from my lectures, changed them into better English, and was the main reason this book got finished. The thanks on the title page don’t say enough.

My secretary, Muriel A. Porter, helped a lot when I needed it. She typed most of the manuscript and many early drafts. I’m very grateful to her.
