I believe that a person's skin color or their parents' religion shouldn’t make a difference in how we treat them. People should be judged by who they are and what they do, not by things like these.

I don’t like it when people are narrow-minded or prejudiced just because they think differently than me. I think less of them for that. But in a free society, the best thing to do is try to convince them to change their views and behavior, not force my opinions on them.

Some states have made rules called fair employment practice laws to stop discrimination in hiring based on race, color, or religion. These laws interfere with people’s freedom to make their own agreements. The state has to approve or disapprove their contracts, which limits freedom in ways we usually don’t like. Also, these laws might affect people who aren’t the ones the law is trying to control.

For example, imagine a neighborhood where people don’t want to be served by Black clerks. If a grocery store there has a job opening and the first qualified applicant is Black, the law might force the store to hire him. This could make the store lose customers and money. If the neighborhood’s preference is strong enough, the store might even have to close. When the store owner hires white clerks instead of Black ones, it might not be because of his own prejudice or taste.
