People who earn about the same amount of money can end up paying very different taxes. This depends on where their money comes from and how easily they can avoid paying taxes. If we made current tax rules work fully, it might hurt people’s motivation to work hard and could make the economy less productive. So, avoiding taxes might actually help the economy. But this comes with a big cost, like wasting resources and causing unfairness. It might be better to have lower tax rates but tax all kinds of income more equally. This could be fairer and waste less.

Many experts agree that the personal income tax system is unfair and doesn’t do a good job of reducing inequality. Even people who support using taxes to make things fairer think the highest tax rates should be lowered and the tax system should cover more types of income.

Another reason the graduated tax system doesn’t reduce inequality much is that it taxes the process of getting rich more than just being rich. These taxes limit how people spend money from their wealth and make it harder to build more wealth. But taxing income from wealth doesn’t lower the wealth itself; it just means owners spend less or add less to their wealth. These taxes make people avoid risks and keep their wealth in safe forms, so their wealth doesn’t disappear easily. On the other hand, most new wealth comes from saving a lot of money from big incomes and investing in risky projects that might bring high rewards. If income taxes worked well, they would stop this from happening.

Because of this, taxes protect people who already have wealth from competition by new rich people. But in reality, many people avoid these taxes. A lot of new wealth has come from oil, where special tax rules let people earn money without paying taxes.
