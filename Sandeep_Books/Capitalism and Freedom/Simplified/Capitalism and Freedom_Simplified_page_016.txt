By mostly depending on people choosing to help and businesses working on their own, in money matters and other things, we can make sure that private companies keep the government’s power in check. This also helps protect our freedom to speak, believe what we want, and think for ourselves.

The second big idea is that government power should be spread out. If government needs to have power, it’s better to have it in smaller areas like towns instead of big places like Washington, D.C.

If I don’t like what my town does—whether it’s about trash, rules, or schools—I can move to another town. Not many people do this, but just knowing I can is a way to keep things fair. If I don’t like what my state does, I can move to a different state. But if I don’t like what the federal government does, I have very few options because countries are strict about their borders.

It’s actually hard to avoid the rules from the federal government, and that’s why some people like having a strong central government. They think it helps make laws that are good for everyone, like helping poor people or using money for public needs. They are right in some ways. But there’s another side to this. The power to do good can also be used to do bad. The people in charge now might not be in charge later, and what one person thinks is good, another might think is bad.

The sad part about wanting a stronger central government, or more government overall, is that it’s usually led by good people who will end up regretting what happens.

Keeping freedom safe is the main reason to limit and spread out government power. But there’s a positive reason too. Big improvements in things like building design, painting, science, writing, factories, and farming never came from the government telling people what to do. Columbus didn’t try to find a new route to China because a parliament told him to, even though a king helped pay for his trip. Newton, Einstein, Shakespeare, Edison, and many others didn’t make their discoveries or creations because the government ordered them to. They did it on their own.
