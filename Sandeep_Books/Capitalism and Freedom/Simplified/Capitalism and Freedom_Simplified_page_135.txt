George Stigler tried to sort industries into three groups: monopolies, competitive businesses, and those run or controlled by the government. He also looked at how these groups changed over time.

By 1939, about one quarter of the economy was run or supervised by the government. Of the other three quarters, at most one quarter, maybe as little as 15%, were monopolies. At least three quarters, maybe up to 85%, were competitive businesses. The government’s role has grown a lot in the last 50 years.

In the private sector, there hasn’t been a clear increase in monopolies; it might have actually gone down.

Many people think monopolies are bigger and more common than these numbers show. This is partly because people mix up absolute size with market share.

As the economy grew, businesses got bigger in size. Some think this means they take up more of the market, but the market itself might have grown even faster. Another reason is that monopolies get more attention in the news than competitive businesses.

If you ask people to name big industries in the U.S., most will say car making, but few will say wholesale trade. Wholesale trade is actually twice as important as car making and is very competitive, so it doesn’t get much attention. Most people can’t name big companies in wholesale trade, even though some are very large. Car making has fewer companies and is closer to a monopoly. Everyone knows the top car companies. Another example: domestic service is much more important than telegraph and telephone industries.

Another reason people overestimate monopolies is because of general bias and the tendency to focus too much on them.
