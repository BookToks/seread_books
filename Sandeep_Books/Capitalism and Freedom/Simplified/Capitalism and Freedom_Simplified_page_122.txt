After the Civil War, the Southern states made many laws to limit the rights of Black people. However, they did not stop Black people from owning property, either land or personal things. This wasn’t because they didn’t want to restrict Black people, but because they believed strongly in private property rights. This belief was stronger than their desire to discriminate. The rules of private property and capitalism actually helped Black people have more opportunities and make more progress than they might have otherwise.

In general, discrimination tends to be strongest in places where one group controls everything and there is little competition. But discrimination is less in places where there is a lot of competition and freedom.

As mentioned earlier, it’s interesting that minority groups often ask for big changes in capitalism. They sometimes blame capitalism for the limits they face, instead of realizing that the free market has actually helped keep those limits smaller.

We’ve already seen that a free market focuses on how well something works, not on things like skin color or religion. For example, when someone buys bread, they don’t know or care if the wheat was grown by a white person or a Black person, a Christian or a Jew. This means producers use their resources as best as they can, no matter what others think about their workers’ backgrounds.

Also, there is a strong reason in a free market to focus on what helps business work best, not on personal feelings about people. A business owner who cares more about who someone is than how well they do their job will be less successful than one who only cares about work skills. This means people who discriminate in business end up making things harder for themselves.
