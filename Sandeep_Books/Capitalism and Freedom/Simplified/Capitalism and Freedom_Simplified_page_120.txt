The problem comes up mostly with income tax, and it’s even bigger there. There are other issues when trying to run this plan across the whole country, but those are mostly minor details and not too serious. The real big problem is political: how to stop this plan from becoming a tool for politics and turning from a self-paying project into just a way to fund vocational education.

But if this risk is real, so is the chance to do something good. Right now, problems with how money works make it hard for people to get expensive vocational or professional training unless their parents or someone else pays for it.

This creates a group of people who don’t have to compete because they have the money, while many other capable people can’t get the money they need. This keeps the gap between rich and poor the same. Setting up plans like the ones mentioned would help more people get money for training, making real chances for everyone, reducing income and wealth gaps, and helping us make the most of everyone’s talents.

It would do this not by stopping competition or taking money away from people, but by making competition stronger, keeping people motivated, and fixing the root causes of inequality.
