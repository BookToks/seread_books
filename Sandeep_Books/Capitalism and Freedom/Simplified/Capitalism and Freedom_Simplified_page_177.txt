This part talks about a really hard ethical question.

Many people say it’s important to tell the difference between inequality in personal abilities and inequality in property. They also say there’s a difference between wealth you inherit and wealth you earn. Inequality from personal abilities or wealth you earn is seen as okay, or at least not as unfair as inequality from inherited wealth.

But this idea doesn’t really work. Is it more fair for someone to get a lot of money because they inherited a special talent that’s in demand than for someone who inherits property? The kids of Russian officials probably expect to earn more than the kids of poor farmers. Is that any more or less fair than the kids of rich Americans? We can look at this differently. A parent with money can help their child in different ways. They can pay for the child’s education, start a business for them, or give them a trust fund. In all these cases, the child will have more money than they would without help. But in the first case, the money is seen as coming from skills; in the second, from business profits; in the third, from inherited wealth.

Is there a good reason to treat these kinds of income differently when it comes to ethics? Also, it seems strange to say a person owns what they earn by their skills or from their wealth, but they can’t give any of it to their kids. People can spend their money however they want, and giving it to their children is just one way to use it.

Just because these arguments against the capitalist idea don’t work doesn’t mean the capitalist idea is right. I find it hard to say if it’s good or bad, or to suggest a better idea.
