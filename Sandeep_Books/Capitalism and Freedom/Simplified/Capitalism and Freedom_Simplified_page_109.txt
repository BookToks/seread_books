There are only a few people who are really talented. This is similar to how people often try to team up to set prices together, like in unions or big companies that control a whole industry. But these agreements usually get broken by competition unless the government supports or enforces them.

If someone wanted to create a system for hiring and paying teachers that scares away creative, brave, and confident people but attracts boring and average ones, they could copy the system that requires teaching certificates and fixed salary levels used in many big cities and states. It’s actually surprising that teachers in elementary and high schools are as good as they are with this system. A different system could fix these problems and let competition reward the best teachers and bring more talented people into teaching.

Why has the government gotten involved in schooling the way it has in the United States? I don’t know enough about education history to give a sure answer. But I have some guesses that might help think about how social rules could change. I’m not sure the ideas I'm suggesting would have been good a hundred years ago. Back then, before travel was easy, it made more sense for the government to have control over schools. Also, the big challenge in the 1800s and early 1900s was not to have many different kinds of schools but to create shared values for a stable society. Lots of immigrants came to the U.S. from all over the world, speaking different languages and having different customs. The “melting pot” idea was to get people to agree on some common values and loyalty. Public schools helped by making English the main language. If there were private schools paid by vouchers, there would have to be rules, like using English, to get approved. But it might have been harder to make sure private schools followed these rules.
