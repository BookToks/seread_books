Non-defense spending stayed about the same, around 31 percent in 1982 and 30 percent in 2000.

People’s opinions changed even more after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and the Soviet Union broke up in 1992. This ended a 70-year experiment comparing two ways to run an economy: one controlled by the government from the top down, and the other run by private businesses and markets. In simple terms, it was socialism versus capitalism. Smaller examples of this were seen in places like Hong Kong and Taiwan compared to mainland China, West Germany versus East Germany, and South Korea versus North Korea. But the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union’s collapse made it clear to everyone that central planning usually leads to problems, just like Friedrich A. Hayek said in his famous 1944 book, The Road to Serfdom.

What happened in the United States and Great Britain also happened in other rich Western countries. After World War II, socialism grew quickly, but later it slowed down or stayed the same. Now, most countries want markets to play a bigger role and governments to have less control. I think this shows how opinions take time to change actions. After the war, people supported more government control, leading to more socialism. But over time, as people’s opinions shifted again, socialism stopped growing. In the future, we’ll probably see less socialism because of these opinion changes and because the Soviet Union fell apart.

This change in opinion has had an even bigger impact on poorer countries. This is true even in China, which still says it’s communist. When Deng Xiaoping started market reforms in the late 1970s, like giving farmers more control over their land, production went up a lot. This opened the door for more market ideas in a country that used to be controlled by the government.

The small increase in economic freedom has really changed China, proving how powerful free markets can be.
