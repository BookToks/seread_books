In Alabama, some jobs like dentists, psychologists in Virginia, doctors in Maryland, and lawyers in Washington need special permission called a license. This license is like old rules where the government gives power to people in that job. But often, the reasons for giving or not giving a license don’t seem connected to how good someone is at their job.

This makes sense because when a small group decides who can work in a job, they might think about things that don’t really matter. What those things are depends on who is on the board and what’s going on in the world at that time. 

For example, during a time when people were afraid of communism, some jobs made people promise they weren’t part of the Communist Party. In 1952, Texas made pharmacists swear they weren’t communists. This didn’t really have anything to do with keeping people healthy. In Indiana, boxers and wrestlers also had to make this promise. A music teacher had to quit his job because he was seen as a communist and then had trouble becoming a piano tuner because of it. In Washington state, vets couldn’t help sick animals unless they signed a promise saying they weren’t communists.

No matter what you think about communism, these rules didn’t really connect to the skills needed for the jobs.
