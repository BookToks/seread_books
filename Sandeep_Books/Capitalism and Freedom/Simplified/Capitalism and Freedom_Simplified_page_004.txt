The way people thought about government changed a lot as the government started doing more things because of welfare programs and new economic ideas called Keynesian views. In 1956, when I gave the lectures that became this book, the government in the United States (federal, state, and local) spent 26 percent of the country’s income. Most of that money was for defense. Spending on things other than defense was 12 percent of the national income.

Twenty-five years later, in 1982 when the new edition of this book came out, total government spending had gone up to 39 percent of national income. Spending on non-defense things had more than doubled, reaching 31 percent of the national income.

This change in how people thought helped leaders like Margaret Thatcher in Britain and Ronald Reagan in the United States get elected. They worked to control the government’s size, but they didn’t make it much smaller. In the U.S., total government spending went down a little, from 39 percent of national income in 1982 to 36 percent in 2000. But almost all of that drop was because less money was spent on defense.
