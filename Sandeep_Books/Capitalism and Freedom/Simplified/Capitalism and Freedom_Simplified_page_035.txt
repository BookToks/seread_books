Chapter II  
The Role of Government in a Free Society  

People often say that totalitarian governments think the goal is more important than the way they get there. This idea sounds a bit confusing. If the goal doesn’t matter when you think about how to reach it, then what does? But this quick answer doesn’t really solve the problem; it just shows the question isn’t asked the right way. Saying the goal doesn’t justify the way you get there means you believe the real goal is to use the right methods. Whether you like it or not, if you can only reach a goal by using bad methods, then you have to choose the more important goal of using good methods instead.  

For liberals, the right way to do things is through free talking and people working together by choice. This means forcing people isn’t okay. The best situation is when everyone agrees because they have talked openly and honestly.
