The government's job in education is to help people get training and make sure it is good enough. Without rules, too many people might spend money on training that doesn’t pay off. To stop this, the government would need to limit how much help it gives. But that would mean some people get help and others don’t, which might feel unfair because taxpayers pay the costs.

The goal is not to take money from rich people and give it to others, but to make sure people can invest in themselves just like they invest in things like buildings or machines. People should pay for their own training and get the rewards from it. They shouldn’t be stopped from getting training just because of money problems.

One way to do this is for the government to help pay for training if someone meets certain standards. The government would give a set amount of money each year for a few years, as long as the person uses it for training at a real school. Then, the person would agree to pay back a part of their future income that’s above a certain amount. This payment could be added to their income tax to keep things simple.

The amount they start paying back would be based on average earnings without the training, and the percentage would be set so the government doesn’t lose money. This way, the people getting the training pay for it themselves over time. The amount of training someone chooses would be up to them. If the government only helps this way, and the payment rules are fair, people will make smart choices about how much training to get.
