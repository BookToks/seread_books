Monopoly and Social Responsibility 133  

Right now, because income taxes are very high for people who make a lot of money, many try to find ways to avoid paying them. This makes it hard to use our resources in the best way. The best fix is to lower the highest tax rates a lot and stop people from finding loopholes to avoid paying taxes.  

SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF BUSINESS AND LABOR  

More and more people think that business leaders and labor bosses have a "social responsibility" that goes beyond just helping their company or union members. But this idea misunderstands how a free economy works. In a free economy, the only social responsibility of a business is to use its resources to make as much profit as possible while following the rules. This means competing fairly and not cheating or lying.  

Similarly, labor leaders should focus on helping their union members. It’s up to the rest of us to make laws that let people work for their own benefit. As Adam Smith said, when people try to help themselves, they often end up helping society more than if they tried to help society directly.  

If business leaders start thinking they have other social responsibilities besides making money for their stockholders, it could seriously hurt our free society. This idea is dangerous. If they have other responsibilities, how would they even know what those are? Can a few private individuals decide what’s best for everyone? Can they decide how much they should sacrifice for society?
