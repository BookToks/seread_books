This situation is a lot like public housing. In both cases, the people who get help are easy to see—the workers whose wages go up and the people who live in publicly built homes.

But the people who get hurt aren’t easy to notice, and their problems don’t seem directly connected to the cause. These are the people who lose jobs or never get hired in certain jobs because of the minimum wage. They end up doing lower-paying work or relying on government help. Also, more people get crowded into poor neighborhoods, which shows we actually need more public housing, not less.

A big reason minimum wage laws get support is not because people want to be fair, but because some groups benefit. For example, northern labor unions and companies want these laws to protect themselves from competition in the South.

Farm price supports are another example. These are meant to help farmers because it’s believed that farmers usually don’t make much money. But even if that’s true, the price supports don’t really help the farmers who need it most. First, richer farmers get more help because they sell more. Poor farmers sell less and grow more for themselves, so they don’t get as much support. Second, most of the money spent doesn’t go directly to farmers. Some of it pays for storage, which helps storage companies more than farmers. Also, when the government buys farm products, farmers spend that money on things like seeds and machines, so the money just keeps moving around.
