The rules about patents and copyrights—like giving patent protection for seventeen years instead of some other time—aren’t based on strict principles. They depend on what works best in real life. I personally think a shorter patent time would be better.

But this is just my quick opinion on a topic that many people have studied a lot and still need to study more.

So, my opinion shouldn’t be trusted too much.

There are three main reasons why monopolies happen: technical reasons, government help, and private groups working together.

First, technical reasons. As explained before, sometimes it’s easier or cheaper for just one company to do something instead of many companies. A good example is a telephone system or water supply in a town.

Unfortunately, there is no perfect fix for technical monopolies. Usually, you have to choose between three bad options: a private monopoly with no rules, a private monopoly controlled by the government, or the government running it.

It’s hard to say which one is always better. The big problem with government control or operation is that it’s very hard to undo later. Because of this, I think the least bad option is a private monopoly without heavy rules, if it can be tolerated.

Changes in the market often break up these monopolies, and sometimes those changes are allowed to happen. Also, even when it seems like there are no choices, there usually are some alternatives, so private companies can’t raise prices too much.

Plus, we’ve seen that government regulators often end up working with the companies, so prices may not be any lower with regulation than without it.
