Control over who can enter certain jobs is only clearly explained during times like the Great Depression when many people are unemployed and money is tight. At normal times, the reason for limiting entry is different. It’s that doctors want to raise what they think are the "quality" standards of their profession. The problem with this idea is common and stops people from truly understanding how the economy works. They mix up technical skill with economic sense.

A story about lawyers helps explain this. At a meeting where lawyers talked about who should be allowed to join their profession, one person used an example from the car industry. He said it would be crazy if car makers were told they could only make cars as fancy as a Cadillac. One lawyer in the audience agreed and said the country should only have top-notch "Cadillac" lawyers! This shows how professionals think. They focus only on the best technical skills and believe we must have only the best doctors, even if that means some people can’t get any medical help—though they don’t say it that way.

Still, the idea that everyone should get the "best" medical care usually leads to rules that limit the number of doctors. I’m not saying this is the only reason, but this thinking makes many good doctors support rules they might normally oppose because it feels like a good reason.

It’s easy to prove that "quality" is just an excuse, not the real reason for limits. The American Medical Association’s Council on Medical Education and Hospitals has used its power to limit how many doctors there are in ways that don’t relate to quality at all. For example, they suggested that only citizens should be allowed to practice medicine.
