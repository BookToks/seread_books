156 CAPITALISM AND FREEDOM

There are different ways people try to get around rules that stop others from joining certain professions. Each group tries to get official permission and set their own rules. This creates different levels and types of practice. For example, there’s regular medical practice and other options like osteopathy, chiropractic, and faith healing. These alternatives might not be as good as regular medical care would have been if there were no entry restrictions.

More generally, if there are fewer doctors than there could be, and all of them are busy, that means there’s less total medical care from trained doctors. The rest of the care has to be done by people who aren’t trained professionals. Sometimes, these people don’t have any special qualifications at all. The problem gets worse when only licensed doctors are allowed to do certain things. We have to decide what counts as "medical practice," and often, many tasks are only allowed to be done by doctors, even if technicians or other skilled people could do them just as well.

Doctors spend a lot of time doing things that others could do, which lowers the total medical care available. You can’t just judge medical care by its quality alone because restrictions mean there’s less care overall. These rules might actually lower the average quality of care in a real way.

Even this doesn’t cover everything because it only looks at the situation at one time and doesn’t consider how things change over time.
