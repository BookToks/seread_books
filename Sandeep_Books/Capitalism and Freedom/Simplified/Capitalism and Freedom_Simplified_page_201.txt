People who believe in freedom also believe that individuals should be free to make their own mistakes. If someone chooses to live for today and spend their money on fun now, even if it means having little money when they are old, who are we to stop them? We can try to convince them they are wrong, but do we have the right to force them to act differently? Maybe they are right and we are wrong. Being humble is important for those who believe in freedom; being bossy and controlling is what a paternalist does.

Not many people are strict paternalists because it doesn’t seem very nice when you think about it carefully.

Still, the idea of paternalism has influenced things like social security, so it’s worth explaining.

One reason to require people to buy annuities (a way to get money when they’re old) is that if they don’t, they might end up poor and need help from others.

People say they don’t want old, poor people to suffer, so society will help them through charity. If someone doesn’t save for old age, they will become a burden on everyone else. Making them buy an annuity is not for their own good but to protect the rest of us.

How strong this argument is depends on the facts. If 90% of people would need public help at age 65 without buying annuities, the argument is strong. But if only 1% would need help, why limit the freedom of the other 99% just to cover the 1%?

When the Social Security Act was created, many people thought a lot of people would become public charges because of the Great Depression. From 1931 to 1940, over one-seventh of workers were unemployed every year. Older workers had it even worse.

This situation was never seen before and hasn’t happened since. It didn’t happen because people were careless with money but because the government didn’t manage things well.
