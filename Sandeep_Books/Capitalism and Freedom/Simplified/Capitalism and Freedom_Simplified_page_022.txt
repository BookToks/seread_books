Because of this, some farmers had to sell their animals at auction to pay social security fees.

Not many people think that having to pay for old age insurance takes away their freedom, but people who care about freedom don’t just follow what most people think.

In the U.S., if a person can’t choose their job freely because they need a license, their freedom is limited. A person who wants to trade goods, like swapping something for a watch with a Swiss person, but can’t because of limits, also loses freedom. The same goes for a person in California who went to jail for selling Alka-Seltzer cheaper than the price set by the company’s rules.

Farmers who can’t grow as much wheat as they want also lose freedom. So, economic freedom—being free to make your own money decisions—is a very important part of overall freedom.

Economic systems matter because they affect how power is shared or concentrated. Competitive capitalism gives people economic freedom and also helps political freedom by keeping economic and political power separate, so they can balance each other out.

History shows that political freedom and free markets go together. There’s no example of a country with real political freedom that didn’t also use some kind of free market for most of its economy.

Because we live in a mostly free society, we forget how rare political freedom is in history and around the world. Most of history has been about tyranny, slavery, and suffering. The 1800s and early 1900s in the Western world were rare times when political freedom grew alongside free markets and capitalism.
