186 CAPITALISM AND FREEDOM

If nationalizing something doesn’t save money or work better than private companies, then it probably isn’t worth it.

One possible reason to nationalize annuities (which are like insurance payments you get later in life) is to make sure everyone buys them. But this isn’t a big deal. There are easier ways to do it, like asking people to show proof they paid when they file their taxes, or having their bosses confirm it. This would be much simpler than the current system.

The costs of nationalization are much higher than this small benefit. Letting people choose and having private companies compete will make better contracts and more options for different needs.

Politically, nationalizing would make the government bigger, which could limit people’s freedom.

There are other problems too. The rules and details are very complicated, so regular people can’t really understand them.

If the government takes over, most of the experts will work for the government or related universities. They usually support expanding government programs, not because they want to, but because they’re used to working within government systems. So far, private insurance companies in the U.S. have helped keep things balanced.

It’s also very hard for Congress to control agencies like Social Security because their work is so technical and they have almost all the experts. These agencies end up running themselves, and Congress usually just approves what they suggest. People who work there want to grow these programs, and it’s very hard to stop them.
