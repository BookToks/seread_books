Railroads in the United States are a good example. Back in the 1800s, it was almost impossible to avoid having just a few big railroad companies because of how the technology worked. That’s why the government created the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to keep them in check. But things have changed since then. Roads and airplanes have made railroads less of a monopoly. Still, the ICC hasn’t gone away. Instead of protecting people from the railroads, the ICC now protects railroads from competition by trucks and other transport options. It even protects truck companies from new competitors. In England, when railroads were taken over by the government, trucks were also controlled by the state at first. If the U.S. had never regulated railroads, transportation would probably be very competitive today, with little monopoly left.

Choosing between private monopolies, government monopolies, or government regulation depends on the situation. If a service is really important and only one company can provide it, a private monopoly might be too harmful. In that case, government control or regulation might be the better choice.

Sometimes, a technical monopoly means the government has to take over. But that doesn’t mean the government should stop others from trying to compete. For example, the government’s monopoly on the post office isn’t fully justified. Some say mail delivery is a technical monopoly, so a government post office is the best option. But the law that makes it illegal for anyone else to deliver mail isn’t fair. If mail delivery really is a technical monopoly, no one else will succeed anyway. If it’s not, then there’s no reason for the government to be the only one doing it. The only way to know is to let others try.
