The second rule probably won’t be fully met because it’s impossible to include non-money benefits, like perks or personal satisfaction. So, in real life, investment in the plan would still be a little too small and wouldn’t be spread out in the best way.

It would be better if private money groups and non-profit groups like foundations and universities worked on this plan. Because it’s hard to guess the basic earnings and the extra earnings that should go to the government, there’s a big risk that the plan would become a political problem. The info about current earnings in different jobs would only give a rough idea of what would make the project pay for itself. Also, the basic earnings and the extra share should change from person to person based on how much they are expected to earn, just like life insurance costs change for groups with different life expectancies.

If the problem is the cost of running the plan, the federal government should provide the money, not smaller local governments. Any state would have the same costs as an insurance company in keeping track of the people it helped. The federal government could lower these costs but not get rid of them completely. For example, someone who moved to another country might still have to pay their agreed share of earnings, but it could be hard and expensive to make them pay. Very successful people might want to move away because of this. A similar problem exists in other cases.
