The reason we have a government-run post office monopoly is because the Pony Express did such a great job delivering mail across the country. When the government started its own mail service, it couldn’t compete and lost money. So, a law was made that no one else could carry the mail. That’s why the Adams Express Company is now just an investment company instead of delivering mail. I think if anyone could start a mail business, many companies would join, and the old way of doing things would change fast.

Another situation where people can’t just trade freely is when one person's actions affect others, and it’s hard to charge or pay for those effects. This problem is called "neighborhood effects." A clear example is when someone pollutes a river. The polluter is basically making others accept dirty water instead of clean water. Those others might be okay with paying for clean water, but they can’t stop the pollution or make the polluter pay by themselves.

A less obvious example is building highways. It’s possible to charge people for using roads so private companies could run them. But for regular roads with many entrances and exits, charging each person would be very expensive because you’d need toll booths everywhere. The gas tax is a cheaper way to charge people based on how much they use the roads. But this tax doesn’t match perfectly with each person’s road use. So, it’s hard for private companies to run and charge for roads without creating big monopolies.

However, this doesn’t apply to long-distance toll roads with lots of traffic and few entrances. For those roads, collecting fees is cheaper, and there are often many alternatives, so there isn’t a serious monopoly problem.
