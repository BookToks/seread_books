The only way I see to stop special producer groups from taking over is to start with the idea that the government should usually not get involved in certain activities.

Only if everyone agrees that government actions should be very limited in these cases can we make sure that anyone who wants to change this has to prove a good reason. This is the only way to stop special rules that just help certain groups. We have talked about this many times before. It’s similar to why we have the Bill of Rights and rules for money and government spending.

There are three levels of control we need to understand: first, registration; second, certification; and third, licensing.

By registration, I mean when people have to put their names on an official list if they do certain activities. No one can be stopped from doing the activity as long as they put their name down. They might have to pay a fee for registering or as a kind of tax.

The second level is certification. This means the government can say someone has certain skills, but it can’t stop others from doing the same job without that certificate. For example, anyone can be an accountant, but only those who pass a test can call themselves Certified Public Accountants (CPA) or put up a sign saying they are CPAs. Certification is often just a middle step. In some places, more and more tasks are only allowed to be done by CPAs. That’s more like licensing, not just certification. In some states, only people who pass a test can use the title “architect.” This is certification. But it doesn’t stop anyone else from giving advice on how to build houses for money.
