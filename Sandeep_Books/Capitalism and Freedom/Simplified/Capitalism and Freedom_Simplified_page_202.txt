GASI is supposed to fix a problem, but it’s for a very different problem than what we’ve dealt with before.

During the 1930s, a lot of people lost jobs, which caused a big problem because many needed help and became dependent on the government. But old age wasn’t the biggest issue back then. Many people who were still able to work were also getting help. Even though GASI has grown a lot and now helps over sixteen million people, the number of people needing public assistance keeps going up.

How families take care of old people has changed a lot. In the past, kids were the main way parents got help when they got old. But as society got richer, things changed. Kids didn’t have to take care of parents as much, and more people saved money or got private pensions for their old age. Lately, more pension plans have been added on top of GASI. Some students think that if things keep going like this, many people will save a lot when they’re young just to live better when they’re old, even better than when they were younger. Some might think this is strange, but if it’s what people want, that’s okay.

Forcing people to buy retirement annuities has caused a lot of costs but not much benefit. It takes away some control over our money because we have to spend it in a certain way, by buying a retirement plan from the government. This stops companies from competing to sell annuities and slows down new retirement ideas. It also created a big government system that keeps growing and trying to control more parts of our lives. And all this just to stop some people from becoming a burden on the public.
