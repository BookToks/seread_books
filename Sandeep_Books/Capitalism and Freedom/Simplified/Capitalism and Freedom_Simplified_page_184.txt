The Distribution of Income is really important to understand. When we look at income for individuals, it shows a lot more inequality than when we look at income for families. This is because many individuals might be housewives working part-time, or other family members who don’t earn much money.

When we talk about families, should we look at their total income? Or should we look at income per person or per equivalent unit? This actually matters a lot. I think the biggest reason inequality has gone down in this country over the last 50 years is because families have fewer kids. This has helped more than taxes on inheritance or income. Families used to have low income and lots of kids, which made life harder. Now, families usually have fewer kids, especially very large families. Because of this, families don’t differ as much in how many kids they have. But if we only look at total family income, this change wouldn’t be clear.

One big problem with understanding income inequality is that we need to separate two different kinds of inequality: short-term differences and long-term differences. Imagine two societies with the same yearly income distribution. In one, families’ income changes a lot every year, so their position in the income ranking moves up and down. In the other, families stay in the same income position year after year. The second society is more unequal because people can’t move up or down. The first kind of inequality shows change, chances to improve, and fairness. The second shows a fixed social status.

This confusion is important because capitalism often changes one type of inequality into the other. Non-capitalist societies usually have more inequality in yearly income, and their inequality tends to be permanent. Capitalism, on the other hand, breaks down fixed social status and creates social mobility.
