Their main protection was having a private market economy where they could find jobs. But this protection wasn’t perfect. Many private employers, whether for good reasons or not, didn’t want to hire those people who were criticized.

It might be that the costs faced by these people were not as bad as the costs usually faced by people who support unpopular ideas. The important thing is that these costs were small and not too hard to handle, unlike if government jobs were the only option.

It’s interesting that many of these people worked in the most competitive parts of the economy—small businesses, trading, and farming—where the market is closest to being a free market.

When someone buys bread, they don’t know if the wheat was grown by a Communist, a Republican, a Constitutionalist, a Fascist, a Black person, or a white person. This shows how the market connects work to how good someone is at it, not their political beliefs or skin color. This helps protect people from being treated unfairly for reasons that don’t matter for their job.

As this example shows, the groups in our society who really need a strong, competitive market are the minority groups that face the most distrust and hate from the majority—like Black people, Jewish people, and immigrants. But, strangely, many enemies of the free market—like Socialists and Communists—come from these groups. Instead of seeing that the market has helped protect them from unfair treatment, they wrongly blame the market for the discrimination they still face.
