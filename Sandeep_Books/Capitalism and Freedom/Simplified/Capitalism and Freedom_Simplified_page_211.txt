198 CAPITALISM AND FREEDOM

Income tax started with low rates but later was used to give more money to the poorer classes. However, many loopholes and special rules made the tax rates, which look high on paper, mostly useless. A flat tax rate of about 23.5% on current taxable income would bring in as much money as the current rates that go from 20% to 91%. The income tax, meant to reduce inequality and spread wealth, has actually helped big companies grow by encouraging them to reinvest their earnings. This has made the capital market less effective and made it harder for new businesses to start.

Monetary reforms, meant to keep the economy and prices stable, actually made inflation worse during and after World War I. They caused more economic ups and downs than ever before. The people in charge of money made a bad economic downturn turn into the Great Depression from 1929-33. A system created to stop bank panics ended up causing the worst banking panic in American history.

A farming program meant to help poor farmers and fix problems in farming has become a national mess. It wasted public money, messed up how resources are used, put heavy controls on farmers, hurt U.S. foreign policy, and didn’t really help the poor farmers.

A housing program meant to improve living conditions for the poor, reduce youth crime, and get rid of slums actually made things worse. It hurt poor people’s housing, increased youth crime, and spread urban decay.

In the 1930s, "labor" meant "labor union" to many smart people. People trusted labor unions like they trusted home and family.

Many laws were made to support labor unions and fair work relations. Unions got stronger. By the 1950s, "labor union" had a bad reputation. It no longer meant "labor" and wasn’t automatically seen as good.
