Laws that give special protections to labor unions, like being exempt from certain rules against monopolies, limits on union responsibility, and the right to speak before special courts, are one reason unions have power.

Even more important is the way people think and how the law treats actions during labor disputes differently from other times. If someone damages property just to be mean or get revenge, they will face legal trouble. But if they do the same thing during a labor dispute, they might not get punished at all. Union actions that involve violence or pressure can happen because the authorities usually look the other way.

3. Private Collusion The last way monopolies happen is when companies secretly work together. Adam Smith said, "People in the same business rarely meet without planning to cheat the public or raise prices." These secret agreements, called cartels, happen often. But they usually don’t last long unless the government helps them.

These cartels raise prices, which makes it easier for new companies to join the market. Also, to keep prices high, the cartel members have to produce less than they want. This makes each member want to secretly lower prices to sell more. Everyone hopes the others will follow the plan. But it only takes one or a few “cheaters” to break the cartel and help the public.

Our antitrust laws mainly stop these secret agreements. They help not just by punishing companies but by making it risky to try these schemes. These laws have banned obvious ways to secretly work together.
