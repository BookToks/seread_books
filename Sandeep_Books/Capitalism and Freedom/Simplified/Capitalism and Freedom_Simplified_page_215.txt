202 CAPITALIS1\{ AND FREEDOM military defense. The importance of government as a buyer of somuch ofouroutput,and thesolebuyeroftheoutputofmany firms and industries, already concentrates a dangerous amount of economic power in the hands of the political authorities, changes the environment in which business operates and the criteriarelevantfor businesssuccess,andintheseandotherways endangers a free market. This danger we cannot avoid. But we needlessly intensify it by continuing the present widespread governmental intervention in areas unrelated to the military de fense of the nation and by undertaking ever new govern mental programs- from medical care for the aged to lunar exploration.
 
 As Adam Smith once said, "There is much ruin in anation".
 
 Our basic structure of values and the interwoven network of free institutions will withstand much. I believe that we shall be able to preserve and extend freedom despite the size of the military programs and despite the economic powers already concentrated in Washington. But we shall be able to do so only if we awake to the threat that we face, only if we persuade our fellow men that free institutions offer a surer, if perhaps at times a slower, route to the ends they seek than the coercive power of the state. The glimmerings of change that are already apparent in the intellectual climate are a hopeful augury.
