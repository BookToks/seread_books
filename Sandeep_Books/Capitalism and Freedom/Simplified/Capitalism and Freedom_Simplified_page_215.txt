The government buys a lot of what we produce, especially for military defense. It is the only buyer for many companies and industries. This gives the government a lot of control over the economy. It changes how businesses work and what they need to do to succeed. This can hurt a free market.

We can't avoid this problem. But we make it worse by letting the government get involved in many things that have nothing to do with military defense. They start new programs all the time, like healthcare for old people or space exploration.

Adam Smith once said, "There is much ruin in a nation."

Our values and free institutions are strong and can handle a lot. I believe we can keep and grow freedom even with big military programs and the power already in Washington. But we can only do this if we realize the danger we face. We need to convince people that freedom and free institutions are a better, even if sometimes slower, way to reach their goals than government control. The small changes we see in how people think now give us hope.
