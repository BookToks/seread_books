As late as 1848, John Stuart Mill said, "Up to now, it’s unclear if all the machines invented have actually made work easier for anyone. They have helped more people live the same hard, boring life, and some factory owners and others have gotten rich. 

They have made life more comfortable for the middle class. But they haven’t started to change people’s lives in big ways, even though they could in the future." This idea was probably wrong even in Mill’s time, but today, no one would say this about rich countries. It’s still true for many other parts of the world.

The biggest thing about progress in the last 100 years is that it has freed many people from really hard work. It has also given them products and services that used to be only for rich people, without really adding new things for the wealthy. Except for medicine, most new technology has just made luxuries that rich people had before available to everyone. Things like modern plumbing, central heating, cars, TV, and radio give regular people the same comforts the rich used to get from servants and entertainers.

It’s hard to find detailed statistics on this, but studies that exist support these ideas. However, these numbers can be confusing. They don’t always show if income differences are fair or unfair.

For example, a baseball player has a short career, so they earn more money each year than in other jobs to make it worth it. But this kind of difference affects income numbers just like any other income difference.
