In a few weeks or months, when things got more stable, the suspension could be ended, and recovery could start without cutting the money supply.

One big reason for creating the Federal Reserve System was to handle situations like this. It was allowed to create more cash if lots of people wanted money instead of keeping it in the bank, and it could give cash to banks based on their assets. This way, people hoped to stop any panic, avoid stopping people from exchanging deposits for cash, and prevent money problems from getting worse.

The first time these powers were needed was in November and December 1930 because many banks were closing. The Federal Reserve System failed badly. It did almost nothing to help banks get cash, acting like the bank closings didn’t need special help. It’s important to know the failure was because they didn’t want to act, not because they couldn’t. They had enough power to give banks the cash people wanted. If they had done this, fewer banks would have closed and the money crisis could have been avoided.

After the first wave of bank failures stopped, early in 1931 people started to feel more confident again. The Federal Reserve saw this chance and reduced its credit, which means it slowed down money growth a bit. Even with this, there were clear signs that money and the economy were getting better. The numbers from the first few months of 1931 looked like the worst was over and things were starting to get better.

But this hopeful start didn’t last long. More banks failed, causing more people to rush to take out their money, and the amount of money in the system went down again. The Federal Reserve did nothing to help. Even though many banks were closing, the Federal Reserve, which is supposed to help in hard times, actually gave less credit to its member banks.
