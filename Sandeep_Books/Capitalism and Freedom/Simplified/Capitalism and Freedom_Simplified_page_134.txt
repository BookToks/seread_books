This chapter only gives a quick look at some big topics: how much monopoly there is, where monopoly comes from, what the government should do about it, and the responsibilities of businesses and workers.

MONOPOLY AREA There are three main kinds of monopoly to think about separately: monopoly in businesses, monopoly in workers, and monopoly made by the government.

1. Monopoly in Business The most important thing to know about monopoly in business is that it doesn’t really matter that much for the whole economy. In the United States, there are about four million different businesses. Every year, about four hundred thousand new businesses start, and a little fewer close down. Almost one in five workers work for themselves. In almost any business, there are both very big companies and very small ones.

It’s hard to say exactly how much monopoly or competition there really is. That’s because words like monopoly and competition are ideas that economists use to study certain problems, not clear labels for real situations. So, it’s not easy to decide if a business or industry is a monopoly or competitive. This confusion causes a lot of misunderstanding.

The same word can mean different things depending on someone's experience. For example, an American student might call something a monopoly while a European would see it as very competitive. Because of this, Europeans reading American discussions might think the U.S. has way more monopolies than it really does.

Many studies, especially by G. Warren Nutter and others, have looked into this.
