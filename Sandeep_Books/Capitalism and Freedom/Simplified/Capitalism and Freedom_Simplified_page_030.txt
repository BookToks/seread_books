But let’s imagine that people manage to give up their own interests for a cause. For supporting capitalism to really work, the people who believe in it must be able to pay for things like public meetings, pamphlets, radio ads, newspapers, and magazines. But how would they get the money?

In a socialist society, there might be some people with high incomes or money saved in government bonds, but these people would be government officials. It’s hard to believe that top officials in a socialist government would pay for activities that go against their system.

The only other way to get money would be to ask many lower-level officials to give small amounts. But this wouldn’t really work.

To get money from these people, many would already have to agree with the cause. The problem is how to start and pay for a campaign to convince them. In capitalist societies, big movements usually aren’t funded by lots of small donations. Instead, a few rich people who believe in the cause pay for it. Examples of such people include Frederick Vanderbilt Field, Anita McCormick Blaine, and Corliss Lamont. Long ago, Friedrich Engels played this role too.

This shows an important but often ignored fact: having rich people can help keep political freedom because they can support new ideas. 

In a capitalist society, you only need to convince a few wealthy people to fund almost any idea, even if it sounds strange. There are many rich people like this, and they support different ideas. Also, you don’t even have to convince them that the idea is good. You just have to show them that the idea will make money. For example, a publisher won’t print only stuff they agree with. They care more about whether enough people will buy it to make a profit.
