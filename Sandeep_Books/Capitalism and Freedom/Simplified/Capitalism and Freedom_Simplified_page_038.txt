Now, I want to talk about which things can’t be handled by the market at all, or only with really high costs, so it might be better to use politics instead.

GOVERNMENT AS RULE-MAKER AND REFEREE  
It’s important to separate the everyday actions of people from the general rules and customs they follow. The everyday actions are like players in a game playing it; the rules are like the game’s rules. Just like a good game needs players to agree on the rules and trust the referee to explain and enforce them, a good society needs its members to agree on the rules that guide their relationships, have a way to settle disagreements about these rules, and have a system to make sure everyone follows them.  

In games and in society, most rules come from habits and traditions that people accept without thinking much about them. Usually, we only make small changes to these rules, but many small changes can end up changing the whole game or society a lot.

In both games and society, rules only work if most people follow them most of the time without needing outside forces to punish them. This means there has to be a broad agreement on the rules. But we can’t just rely on habits or agreement to explain and enforce the rules; we need a referee. This is what government does in a free society: it helps us change the rules when needed, helps solve arguments about the rules, and makes sure that the few people who don’t follow the rules get punished.

We need government because complete freedom isn’t possible. Even though some people might like the idea of no rules (anarchy), it just doesn’t work in a world where people aren’t perfect.
