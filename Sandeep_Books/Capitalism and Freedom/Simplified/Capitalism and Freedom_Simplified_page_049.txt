10. Things like "public housing" and other government programs that help build homes, such as F.H.A. and V.A. mortgage guarantees, are examples.

11. For the military, forcing people to serve during peace time is another issue.

The best way is to have volunteer soldiers, meaning paying people to join. There’s no reason not to pay enough to get the number of soldiers needed. The current system is unfair and random, messes with young men’s freedom to live their lives, and probably costs more than paying volunteers. (Universal military training to have a reserve for war might be okay for different reasons.)

12. National parks, like mentioned before.

13. It’s illegal to carry mail just to make money.

14. Roads owned and run by the government that charge tolls, as mentioned earlier.

This list is not complete.
