So, this system will only work if the leaders in a country with money problems are okay with causing deflation, which can lead to people losing jobs, to fix their payment issues. Or if the leaders in the country with extra money are okay with causing inflation.

The same results can happen by changing exchange rates instead of changing prices inside the country. For example, if a car’s price in the U.S. drops from $2,800 to $2,520, that’s like a 10% fall.

If the pound stays at $2.80, then the car’s price in Britain would drop from £1,000 to £900. The same price drop in Britain would happen without changing the U.S. price if the pound’s value goes up from $2.80 to $3.11.

Before, someone in England needed £1,000 to get $2,800.

Now, they only need £900 to get $2,800. They wouldn’t notice any difference if the price drop was because of a lower U.S. price or a change in exchange rate.

There are different ways exchange rates can change. With fixed exchange rates, a government can say it’s changing the value of its currency, called devaluation or appreciation. Or the exchange rate might not be fixed and can change every day, like the Canadian dollar did from 1950 to 1962.

If it’s a market rate, it can be decided by private trade, like the Canadian dollar from 1952 to 1961. Or the government can control it by buying or selling currency, like in Britain from 1931 to 1939 and in Canada at other times.

Out of all these methods, only a free-floating exchange rate is automatic and not controlled by the government.

The changes caused by lowering prices or changing exchange rates lead to changes in how goods and services move between countries.
