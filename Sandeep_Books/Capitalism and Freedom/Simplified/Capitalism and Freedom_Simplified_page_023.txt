Political freedom existed during the golden age of Greece and the early Roman times.

History shows that capitalism is needed for political freedom, but it is not enough by itself. Countries like Fascist Italy, Fascist Spain, Germany at different times in the last seventy years, Japan before World Wars I and II, and tsarist Russia before World War I were not politically free. Still, private business was the main way their economies worked. This means a country can have capitalism but not be politically free.

Even in those countries, people had more freedom than in modern totalitarian states like Russia or Nazi Germany, where the government controlled both politics and the economy. Even in tsarist Russia, some people could change jobs without asking the government because capitalism and private property limited the state's power a bit.

The link between political and economic freedom is complicated and not one-sided. In the early 1800s, Bentham and the Philosophical Radicals thought political freedom would lead to economic freedom. They believed most people were held back by rules and that if they got the vote, they would choose less government control in business. Looking back, they were partly right. Political changes did bring economic changes toward more free markets, and this helped many people live better lives.

After Benthamâ€™s ideas won in 19th-century England, there was a push back with the government getting more involved in the economy. This move toward collectivism grew faster in England and other places because of the two World Wars. In democratic countries, helping people through welfare became more important than focusing just on freedom.
