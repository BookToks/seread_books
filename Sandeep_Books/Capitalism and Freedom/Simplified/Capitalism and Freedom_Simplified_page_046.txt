Freedom only works for people who can be responsible.

We don’t think crazy people or kids should have total freedom. We have to decide who is responsible and who isn’t, but this makes the idea of freedom a bit unclear. For those we see as not responsible, like crazy people, we have to step in and protect them.

The clearest example is with crazy people. We don’t want to give them full freedom, but we also don’t want to harm them. It would be great if people could just help take care of them on their own, but that might not work because everyone benefits if someone else helps, so not enough people might do it.

Because of this, the government might need to take care of them.

Kids are trickier. Families are the main part of society, not just individuals. We think parents usually do the best job protecting their kids and helping them grow into responsible people who deserve freedom. But parents don’t have the right to do whatever they want with their kids. Kids will grow up to be responsible people and deserve their own rights.

To say it another way, kids are both something parents use and future members of society. People have the freedom to use their money as they want, including having kids. But once they have kids, those kids matter on their own and have their own freedoms, not just the parents’ freedoms.

The idea that the government should protect people who can’t protect themselves is hard for people who believe in freedom. It means some people have to make decisions for others, which many see as a bad thing. This is something liberals don’t like because it reminds them of big government ideas like communism, socialism, or a welfare state.
