Another reason is people mixing up a real gold standard with a fake one. With a real gold standard, the prices of different countries' money compared to each other would stay almost the same because they would all be based on gold. It’s easy to think we can get the benefits of a real gold standard just by pretending to follow it—a fake gold standard where currency prices stay fixed only because they are controlled in unfair markets.

Another problem is that everyone wants a free market for others but thinks they deserve special treatment themselves. This is especially true for bankers when it comes to exchange rates. They want a guaranteed price and don’t know about the market tools that would help handle changes in exchange rates. Also, companies that would help by betting on these changes or making quick trades don’t exist in a free exchange market. This keeps things the same as they are now. For example, in Canada, some bankers who had a free exchange rate for years wanted to keep it that way and didn’t want the government to fix or control the rates.

The most important reason, I think, is people misunderstanding what happened with floating exchange rates because of a mistake in how they look at the numbers. A simple example is Arizona. It has the highest death rate from tuberculosis in the U.S., so it seems like the worst place for sick people. But that’s not the full story. This mistake is harder to see with exchange rates.

When countries have big financial problems because of bad money management or other reasons, they end up using flexible exchange rates. No rules or trade limits can keep an exchange rate fixed if it doesn’t match the real economy.

So, it’s true that floating exchange rates often happen during times of money problems and economic trouble, like really bad inflation or serious but less extreme inflation seen in many South American countries.
