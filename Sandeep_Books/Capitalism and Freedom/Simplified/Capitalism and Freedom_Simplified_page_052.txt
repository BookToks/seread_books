The Charybdis is the idea that dealing with unexpected problems means giving a lot of power to a group of experts, either in an "independent" central bank or a government office. Neither way has worked well before, and probably won’t work well in the future.

A liberal is basically scared of too much power being held by one group. Their goal is to keep as much freedom as possible for each person, as long as one person’s freedom doesn’t stop others from being free. They think power should be spread out. They don’t trust giving the government jobs that the market can do, because that forces people instead of letting them choose freely, and it also risks losing freedom in other parts of life.

Spreading out power is really tricky when it comes to money. Most people agree that the government should have some control over money. It’s also well known that controlling money is a powerful way to influence the economy. Lenin showed this by saying the best way to destroy a society is to destroy its money.

This idea is also seen in everyday history. For a long time, rulers have used control of money to collect heavy taxes from people, often without the approval of lawmakers. This happened when kings clipped coins or used other tricks, and still happens today with modern methods like printing money or changing numbers in books. The challenge is to create rules that let the government manage money but also limit its power, so it doesn’t hurt freedom in society.
