I don’t see any good reason, whether from a liberal point of view or any other, to support this kind of money redistribution. The money given to people doesn’t depend on whether they are rich or poor; rich people get just as much as poor people. The tax used to pay for this is the same rate for everyone up to a limit. This means it takes a bigger part of money from people who earn less than from those who earn more. How can it be fair to tax young people to pay old people, no matter how much money the old people have? Or to tax poorer people more than richer people for this? Also, why raise money through taxes on payrolls?

The second kind of redistribution happens because the system probably won’t pay for itself completely. When a lot of people were paying taxes and only a few were getting benefits, it seemed like the system was paying for itself and even had extra money. But this ignores the fact that the system owes money to those paying taxes. It’s doubtful that the taxes collected are enough to cover what’s owed. Many experts say that even when looking only at cash, the system will need extra money. Other countries with similar systems usually need subsidies too. This is a complicated topic we don’t need to get into now, and people can honestly disagree about it.

What matters here is just asking, if the system really needs extra money from general taxes, can that be fair? I don’t see any reason to support giving extra money like that. We might want to help poor people. But is it fair to help people just because of their age, whether they are rich or poor? Isn’t that a random way to share money?

The only argument I’ve heard to justify this kind of redistribution in GASI is one I think is really wrong, even though many people use it. It says that on average, OASI helps poor people more than rich people, even if it’s random. It also says it would be better to do this kind of money sharing more fairly. But since people won’t vote for direct money sharing, they will accept it if it’s part of a social security plan.
