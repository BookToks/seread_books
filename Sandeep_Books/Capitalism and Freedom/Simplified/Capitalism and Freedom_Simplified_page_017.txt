Their achievements came from smart individuals, strong opinions from a few people, and a society that allowed different ideas and ways of living.

The government can never copy the variety and differences in what individuals do. At any time, by making everyone follow the same rules for housing, food, or clothes, the government could probably help many people live better. By setting the same standards for schools, roads, or cleanliness, the government could also make many local areas better and maybe improve life for all communities on average. But if this happens, progress would stop, and everything would become boring and average. Variety is important because it allows new ideas and experiments that can help those who are behind catch up.

This book talks about some big ideas. The main idea is how competitive capitalism—the way most economic work is done by private businesses in a free market—supports economic freedom and is needed for political freedom. A smaller idea is about what role the government should have in a society that values freedom and mostly depends on the market to organize the economy.

The first two chapters talk about these ideas in a general way, focusing on principles instead of specific examples.

The later chapters show how these ideas apply to different problems.

A general explanation can be complete and cover everything, though the two chapters that follow do not fully do this. The way these ideas are used can never cover everything because new problems and situations come up every day. This is why the government’s role can never be fixed once and for all with exact duties. It also shows why we need to look again from time to time at how these important principles relate to the problems we face today.
