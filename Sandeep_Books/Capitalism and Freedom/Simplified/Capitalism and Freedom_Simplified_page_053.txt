CAPITALISM AND FREEDOM A COMMODITY STANDARD

In history, many places have used a commodity standard for money. This means using a physical item like gold, silver, brass, tin, cigarettes, or even cognac as money. If money was only made of these physical things, the government wouldn’t need to control it. The amount of money would depend on how hard it is to make or find the commodity, not on other rules. Changes in money supply would happen because of how easy it is to produce the commodity and how much people want to use money. Many people who support a gold standard think this is the perfect system.

But in real life, commodity standards have not worked exactly like this simple idea without any government control.

In history, systems like the gold or silver standard also used something called fiduciary money. This is money that can be exchanged for the commodity at a fixed rate, like paper money that says it can be traded for gold. There was a good reason for this. The problem with a commodity standard is that it takes real work and resources to add more money. For example, people have to dig up gold in South Africa to add more money, then store it safely like in Fort Knox. Using real resources like this makes people want to find ways to have money without wasting so much effort. If people trust paper money that says "I promise to pay — units of the commodity," this paper can work like real gold or silver but costs much less to make. This is the main problem with a commodity standard.

If a fully automatic commodity standard was possible, it would be a great way to keep money stable, which many people want.
