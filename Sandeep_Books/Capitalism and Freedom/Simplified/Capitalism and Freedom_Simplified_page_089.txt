The government sold securities to cover its money problems, which helped people save money while government spending created jobs. This idea has been proven wrong by both theory and real-life experience, including new types of private investments that people didn’t expect. But the idea still left its mark. Even if no one really believes it now, government programs based on this idea, like some meant to boost the economy, still exist and cause government spending to grow.

Lately, the focus has been on government spending not to boost the economy or stop slow growth, but to keep things balanced. When private spending goes down, government spending should go up to keep total spending steady. When private spending goes up, government spending should go down. But this balance doesn’t work well. Even small recessions scare politicians, who worry it might lead to a big crash like in 1929-33. So, they quickly approve government spending programs. Many of these programs only start after the recession is over.

Because of this, these programs often make the recovery bigger instead of helping during the recession. Also, when the economy gets better, politicians don’t rush to stop or cut these programs. They say that a strong recovery shouldn’t be hurt by cutting government spending.

The main problem with this balance idea isn’t that it failed to stop recessions—it did help—or that it caused inflation—it did that too. The biggest issue is that it made the government keep growing and stopped taxes from getting smaller.
