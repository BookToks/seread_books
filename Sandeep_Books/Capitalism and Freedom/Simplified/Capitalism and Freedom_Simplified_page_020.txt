Chapter I + The Relation between Economic Freedom and Political Freedom IT IS WIDELY BELIEVED that politics and economics are separate and largely unconnected; that individual freedom is a political problem and material welfare an economic problem; and that any kind of political arrangements can be combined with any kind of economic arrangements. The chief contemporary man ifestation of this idea is the advocacy of "democratic socialism" by many who condemn out of hand the restrictions on individ ual freedom imposed by "totalitarian socialism" in Russia~ and who are persuaded that it is possible for a country to adopt the essential features of Russian economic arrangements and yet to ensure individual freedom through political arrangements. The 8 CAPITALISM AND FREEDOM thesis of this chapter is that such a view is a delusion, that there is an intimate connection between economics and politics, that only certain combinations of political and economic arrange ments are possible, and that in particular, a society which is socialist cannot also be democratic, in the sense ofguaranteeing individualfreedom.
