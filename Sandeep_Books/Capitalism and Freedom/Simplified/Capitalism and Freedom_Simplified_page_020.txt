Chapter I  
The Relation between Economic Freedom and Political Freedom  

Many people think that politics and economics are separate and don't really affect each other. They believe that individual freedom is all about politics, and money and wealth are just economic issues. Some also think you can mix any kind of political system with any kind of economic system without problems.  

Today, this idea is often shown by people who support "democratic socialism." They criticize the lack of personal freedom in "totalitarian socialism" like in Russia and believe a country can use Russia's economic ideas but still keep political freedom.  

The main point of this chapter is that this belief is wrong. Politics and economics are closely linked. Only certain political and economic systems can work together. Specifically, a country that is socialist cannot be truly democratic if democracy means guaranteeing individual freedom.
