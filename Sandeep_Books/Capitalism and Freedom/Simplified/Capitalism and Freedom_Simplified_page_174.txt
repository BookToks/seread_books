The Distribution of Income

One big idea in this century, especially in Western countries, is that people believe everyone should have equal income. Many think the government should help make this happen. When we think about this idea, we need to ask two different questions.

The first question is about what is right and fair: why should the government try to make incomes equal? The second question is about facts: what actually happens when the government tries to do this?

THE ETHICS OF DISTRIBUTION

The fair idea that supports how income is shared in a free market system is: everyone should get paid based on what they and the things they own produce.
