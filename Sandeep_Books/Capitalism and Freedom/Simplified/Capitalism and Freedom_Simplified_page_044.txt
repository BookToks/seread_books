So, there are good reasons why highways should be owned and run by private companies. If that happens, the company running the highway should get the money from gas taxes paid by drivers using it.

Parks are a good example because they show the difference between places that need government help and those that don’t. Many people think National Parks, like Yellowstone or the Grand Canyon, should be run by the government. But actually, city parks and national parks are different.

The big difference is this: for a city park, it’s hard to figure out exactly who benefits from it and to charge those people. If there’s a park in the middle of a city, people living nearby and those passing through all enjoy it. Charging people at every entrance or by how many windows face the park would be really hard and costly. But national parks like Yellowstone have only a few entrances, and most visitors stay for a while. So, it’s easy to have toll gates and charge admission. This already happens, but the money from these fees doesn’t cover all costs. If people want these parks enough to pay for them, private companies would want to run them. Actually, there are already many private parks like this. I don’t see any strong reasons for the government to run national parks.

Ideas about “neighborhood effects” have been used to justify all kinds of government actions. But often, this is just an excuse, not a good reason. Neighborhood effects can be a reason both to limit government and to expand it. They make it hard for people to trade freely because it’s tough to see how actions affect others and to measure those effects. But this problem also happens with government activities.
