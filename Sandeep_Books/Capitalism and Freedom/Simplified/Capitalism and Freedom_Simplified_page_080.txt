FLOATING EXCHANGE RATES AS THE FREE MARKET SOLUTION

There are only two ways that match a free market and free trade. One is a fully automatic international gold standard. But as we saw before, this isn’t possible or a good idea. Also, we can’t just decide to use it by ourselves.

The other way is a system where exchange rates float freely. That means the rates are set by private people trading, without the government stepping in. This is the true free market answer to money rules. If we don’t use it, we won’t be able to grow free trade and might have to put strict controls on trade later.

Things can change suddenly, just like in other areas. We might get through the problems we have now (April 1962) and maybe even have extra money instead of losing it.

If this happens, other countries might have to put controls on trade. Back in 1950, I suggested floating exchange rates because Europe was having money problems and there was a "dollar shortage." Things can switch like that. Because it’s hard to guess when and how these changes happen, that’s why a free market system is the best choice.

Our goal isn’t just to fix a money problem. It’s to have a system that lets free market forces quickly and automatically react to changes in international trade.

Even though floating exchange rates seem like the best free market solution, only a small group of liberals, mostly economists, support it. Many liberals who don’t like government control in other areas don’t support it here either. Why? One reason is simply the power of sticking with what’s already there.
