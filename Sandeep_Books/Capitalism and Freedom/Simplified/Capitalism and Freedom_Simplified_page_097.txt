Sadly, none of these changes are based on good proof. They come from guesses based on simple experience.

Together with some of my students, I have done some detailed research in the U.S. and other countries to find better proof. The results are surprising. They show that what really happens is closer to what the quantity theory says than what Keynesian theory predicts.

The evidence suggests that if the government spends an extra $100, it usually adds about $100 to total income—sometimes less, sometimes more. This means that when government spending goes up compared to income, it doesn’t really make the economy grow in any important way. It might increase money income, but all of that is taken up by government spending. People’s private spending stays the same. Because prices probably go up or don’t drop as much, private spending actually becomes smaller when you look at real value. The opposite happens if government spending goes down.

These ideas aren’t final answers.

They come from the biggest and most complete evidence I know, but even this evidence isn’t perfect.

One thing is clear though. Whether popular beliefs about government spending effects are right or wrong, they don’t match this big set of evidence. I don’t know of any other strong evidence that supports those beliefs. They are more like economic myths, not proven facts from research or studies. Still, these ideas have had a huge impact in getting people to support big government control over the economy.
