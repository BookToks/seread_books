This is a simple explanation of the Keynesian multiplier, which here is three. If the government spends $100, income goes up by $300. But if the government only spends $100 once, the income increase will fade away and go back to normal. If the government spends $100 more every year, income should stay $300 higher each year.

This idea sounds nice, but it’s not that simple. Other things need to be considered. When you do, the final result isn’t so sure. Income might not change at all, because if the government spends $100 more, people might spend $100 less. Even if income goes up, prices might rise too, so the real money people have won’t increase much or at all. Let’s look at some problems with this idea.

First, the simple explanation doesn’t say what the government spends the $100 on. For example, what if it spends it on something people were already paying for? Imagine people paid $100 for park fees that paid workers to keep the park clean. Now the government pays those workers and lets people enter free. The workers still get paid the same, but the people who paid before now have $100 left.

This extra $100 doesn’t really add to anyone’s income. It just lets people use their money for other things, which they might not care about as much. So, they might spend less on other stuff than before. It’s hard to say how much less. Even if people save one-third of extra money, it doesn’t mean they will spend two-thirds of the $100 they saved from the park fees on other things. One possibility is they just keep buying the same things as before and save the extra $100 instead.
