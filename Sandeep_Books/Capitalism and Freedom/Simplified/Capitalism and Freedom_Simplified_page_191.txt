CAPITALISM AND FREEDOM MISCELLANEOUS WELFARE MEASURES

I. Public Housing

People often say public housing is good because bad neighborhoods, especially slums, cause extra problems like more fires and police calls. This is called a neighborhood effect. This might be true. But if it is, it means we should tax bad housing more, not build public housing. Higher taxes would make sure the costs caused by bad housing are paid for.

Some will say taxing bad housing would hurt poor people, and that’s not fair. This shows public housing is really meant to help poor people. But if the goal is to help poor people, why only help with housing?

If we want to help poor families, wouldn’t it be better to just give them money instead of housing? Families would probably prefer cash because they can choose how to spend it, maybe on housing or something else they need more.

So, giving cash would never make them worse off. If they need other things more than housing, they would be better off. Also, cash could help with neighborhood problems too because they could use some of it to pay higher taxes caused by bad housing.

Public housing can’t be justified just because of neighborhood problems or helping poor families. It can only be justified if we think families “need” housing more than other things but might not choose or spend money wisely. People who believe in freedom might reject this idea for adults. They might accept it a little for children, thinking parents might not care enough about kids’ housing needs. But they would want strong proof before agreeing to spend a lot on public housing.
