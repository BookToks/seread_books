After World War II, the U.S. had more money saved up, but lately, those savings have been going down. When we had more money, we didn’t mind inflation as much. Since 1958, though, because gold was leaving, we’ve been more worried about prices going down. Even though we didn’t change the official price of gold, other countries did, which changed how their money compared to the U.S. dollar. This caused some pressure and changes.

Other countries used strict rules to control trade. Since the U.S. has had trade problems, we also started using different rules to control payments. For example, we limited how many foreign goods tourists could bring without paying taxes, made foreign aid be spent in the U.S., stopped families from joining soldiers overseas, and set tighter limits on oil imports. We even asked other countries to help fix the U.S. trade problems, which was embarrassing.

Out of all these ways to manage trade, using strict rules is the worst because it hurts free trade and freedom. But since we don’t have a clear plan, we keep using these strict controls more and more. We say free trade is good, but we’re doing the opposite because of trade problems. Even if we lower all tariffs, we still need a better way to fix trade deficits. Otherwise, we’ll just swap one problem for a worse one. Tariffs are bad, but quotas and strict controls are worse because they involve government messing directly in business and giving special favors. Even worse are unofficial deals, like when Japan "voluntarily" agreed to limit textile exports.
