6 CAPITALISM AND FREEDOM

The word "liberalism" means different things now than it did before. In the 1600s, liberals fought against government control of the economy. But some people today want to go back to those old ideas, and they call real liberals old-fashioned!

The change in what liberalism means is bigger when talking about money and business than when talking about politics. Today's liberals, like those in the 1800s, support things like voting, representative government, and civil rights. But there is a big difference in how they see power. Nineteenth-century liberals wanted to keep power spread out so no one could control too much, whether the government or private companies. But twentieth-century liberals trust the government more and want more power in big central governments, like national or even world governments.

Because the word "liberalism" got confused, many ideas that used to be called liberal are now called conservatism. But that doesn’t fit well. The old liberals were radicals, meaning they wanted to make big changes in society. Their modern followers should be the same. We don’t want to keep government actions that limit our freedom, but we do want to keep those that help it. Also, "conservatism" now means many different and sometimes opposite things, so we might see new names like libertarian-conservative or aristocratic conservative.

I don’t want to give up the word "liberalism" to people who want to take away freedom. Since I can’t find a better word, I will use "liberalism" in its original meaning – the ideas about being a free person.
