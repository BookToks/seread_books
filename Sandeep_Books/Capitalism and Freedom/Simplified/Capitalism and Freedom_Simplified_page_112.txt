One big reason these schools grew was because they were cheaper. Most state and city colleges and universities charge much lower tuition than private ones. Because of this, private schools have had serious money problems and have complained that the competition isn’t fair.

They want to stay independent from the government, but at the same time, money issues have made them want to ask the government for help.

This idea shows a way to fix the problem. The government paying for higher education can be okay if it helps train young people to be good citizens and leaders. But a lot of the current money is spent on job training, which can’t really be justified this way or in any other way. It doesn’t make sense to only give money to state-run schools. Instead, any support should be given to students so they can choose the school they want, as long as the education is the kind the government wants to support. Government schools should charge fees that cover their costs and compete fairly with private schools.

This system would be similar to how the U.S. paid for veterans’ education after World War II, but the money would likely come from the states, not the federal government.

Using this system would make schools compete better and use their resources more efficiently. It would remove the need for direct government help to private schools, allowing them to stay independent and diverse while still growing.
