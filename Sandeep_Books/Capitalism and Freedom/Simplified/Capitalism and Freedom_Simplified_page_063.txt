It’s hard to say what would have happened during the Great Depression if the Federal Reserve hadn’t bought so many government securities. Between July 1929 and March 1933, the amount of money in the U.S. dropped by one-third. Most of this drop happened after England stopped using the gold standard.

If the money supply hadn’t fallen like that, the economic problems would have been shorter and less bad. It still might have been a tough time, but it’s almost impossible that income and prices would have dropped so much if the money supply had stayed steady. I don’t know of any big economic downturn anywhere that didn’t have a big drop in money, or any time money dropped a lot without a severe depression happening.

The Great Depression in the U.S. doesn’t show that the private business system is unstable. Instead, it shows how much damage a few people can cause when they have a lot of control over a country’s money system.

Maybe the mistakes they made were understandable based on what they knew back then, but I don’t really think so. But that’s not the main issue. Any system that gives a few people so much control that their mistakes—whether excusable or not—can cause big problems is a bad system. It’s bad for people who believe in freedom because it lets a few people have too much power without checks from the public. This is the main political reason to be against an "independent" central bank. 

It’s also bad for people who care more about safety than freedom. Mistakes will happen when responsibility is spread out but power is held by a few people, making important decisions depend too much on who those people are. This is the main technical reason to be against an "independent" bank. To borrow a line from Clemenceau, money is way too important to be left just to central bankers.
