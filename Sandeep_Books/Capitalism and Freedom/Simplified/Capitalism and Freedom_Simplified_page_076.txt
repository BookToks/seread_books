Sometimes, countries face problems when their money is not worth the same as other countries’ money, or when prices change a lot in different places. These problems happen all the time.

There are only four ways a country can fix these problems, and usually they use a mix of them.

First, the U.S. can use or add to its savings of foreign money. This means the government can use its gold since gold can be exchanged for other countries’ money. Or, it can borrow foreign money and exchange it for U.S. dollars. Other countries can also buy dollars by selling their money to the U.S. Using these savings is only a short-term fix, and the U.S. worries a lot about this.

Second, prices inside the U.S. can be made lower compared to prices in other countries. This was how things worked under the old gold system. If the U.S. spent more than it earned, gold would leave the country. This would mean there’s less money overall, so prices and incomes would drop. In other countries, gold coming in would increase their money supply, so prices and incomes would go up. Lower U.S. prices and higher foreign prices would make U.S. goods cheaper and more attractive to other countries, and foreign goods more expensive for Americans. This helps fix the problem without needing more gold to move.

Today, this doesn’t happen automatically. Gold might still move first, but it won’t change the amount of money in a country unless the government decides to let it. Now, central banks or governments can control money amounts even if gold moves or doesn’t move.
