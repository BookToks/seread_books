U.S. securities can be quickly sold for dollars. At any time, people who have these dollar balances can start a run on the U.S. Treasury by trying to change their dollars into gold. This actually happened in the fall of 1960, and it might happen again someday, maybe even soon.

These two problems are connected in two ways. First, just like a bank, problems with income accounts make people lose trust that the U.S. can keep its promise to sell gold at $35 an ounce. The U.S. has been borrowing money from other countries to balance its accounts, which makes people want to trade their dollars for gold or other currencies. Second, the fixed gold price helps set the value of the dollar compared to other currencies, and gold flows help fix any money problems between countries.

We can understand these problems better by looking at other ways to balance payments between countries. This is the first and more basic problem.

Imagine the U.S. is almost balanced in international payments, but then something changes. For example, fewer foreigners want to buy dollars, or more dollar holders want to buy foreign currency. This could cause a "deficit" in U.S. payments. This might happen because other countries get better at making things, the U.S. gets worse, or the U.S. spends more on foreign aid.
