Progress in any science or field often comes from one person out of many who might seem like outsiders or not taken seriously. In medicine today, itâ€™s really hard to do research or experiments unless you are already a doctor. Even if you are a doctor and want to keep your good reputation, there are strict limits on what kinds of experiments you can do.

A "faith healer" might just be someone tricking patients, but maybe one in a thousand or more could actually help improve medicine. There are many ways to learn and gain knowledge. When medicine is controlled by one specific group who mostly stick to traditional ideas, it stops new experiments from happening and slows down how fast we learn new things.

This is true not only for the medical knowledge itself but also for how the medical system is organized. I will explain more about this later.

Licensing doctors and giving them a monopoly on practicing medicine can also lower the quality of care. It reduces the number of doctors and the total hours they can work on important tasks. It also cuts down the motivation for research and new ideas. Plus, it makes it harder for people to sue doctors for malpractice. Being able to sue is one way people protect themselves from bad doctors.

Some malpractice cases do happen, and doctors complain about how much they pay for insurance. But there are fewer lawsuits and fewer wins than you might think because medical groups watch over and protect doctors. It is hard for one doctor to testify against another because they might lose the right to work in important hospitals.
