54 CAPITALISM AND FREEDOM

Right now, it makes sense to control money by focusing on how much money there is. I think the best plan is to have a law that tells the people in charge of money to keep the amount of money growing at a certain rate. By money, I mean cash outside banks plus all the money people have in bank accounts.

The law would say the Reserve System must make sure the total money grows steadily every month, or even every day if possible, at a rate between 3 and 5 percent each year. It doesn’t matter exactly how we define money or the exact growth rate, but it’s important to pick one clear definition and a steady growth rate.

Right now, this rule would limit how much power the money bosses have, but they would still have some choices about how to reach the growth goals, like managing debt or watching banks.

Other changes to banking and government money rules, which I have explained somewhere else, are possible and good ideas. These changes would stop the government from interfering too much in loans and investments and make government money actions more steady and predictable. But these are less important than making a clear rule about controlling the money supply.

I want to say that my idea isn’t perfect or the final answer for managing money forever. I think it’s the best plan we have now for keeping money steady. I hope that as we try it and learn more, we can come up with even better rules to do an even better job.
