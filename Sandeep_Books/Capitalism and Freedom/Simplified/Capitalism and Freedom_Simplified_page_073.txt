Private property is really important for a free business society to work.

Taking control of gold at a low price by the government is basically the same as when Fidel Castro took land and factories at low prices.

So, how can the U.S. complain about other countries doing this when it does the same thing?

Some people who support free business get really blind when it comes to gold. In 1960, Henry Alexander, a big banking leader, suggested that Americans shouldn't be allowed to own gold, even if it was held in other countries! President Eisenhower agreed, and not many bankers said anything against it.

They said the reason was to save gold for money use, but the real reason was so the government could keep all the profits from gold's price going up, instead of letting regular people benefit.

Cancelling gold contracts was done for the same reason.

This was also against free business rules because contracts made honestly between people were ignored to help the government.

When talking about money between countries, there are two main problems: balance of payments and the risk of everyone trying to take gold at once.

You can think of it like a bank. A bank needs to earn enough from fees and loans to pay its bills, like workers' pay, loan interest, supplies, and profits for owners.

It has to keep its money coming in healthy to keep running well.
