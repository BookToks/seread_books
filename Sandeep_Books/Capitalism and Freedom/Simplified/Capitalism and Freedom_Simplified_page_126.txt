If a person who wants to sing blues can get a job but someone who wants to sing opera can’t, it just means that people want to pay for blues singing more than opera singing. The opera singer is "hurt" by what people like. If people liked opera more, the blues singer would be the one "hurt." This kind of harm doesn’t happen because someone is forced to do something or because it costs or benefits others without their choice.

There is a good reason for the government to stop people from forcing harm on others, which means stopping people from being forced to do things. But there is no reason for the government to stop this kind of "harm" where people just don’t like something. In fact, when the government gets involved like this, it takes away freedom and stops people from freely working together.

FEPC laws accept an idea that the people who support them would not like in other situations. If the government can say people can’t treat others unfairly in jobs because of their skin color, race, or religion, then it could also say people must treat others unfairly for those reasons if most people agree. The bad laws made by Hitler and the unfair laws in the Southern U.S. that hurt Black people are examples like this. People who support FEPC can’t say these laws are wrong in principle. They can only say the reasons behind those laws are wrong and try to convince others to use better reasons.

Looking at history, if every case was judged only by its own details and not by general rules, many bad ideas would be accepted by the majority. This would be very bad, even for people who now support FEPC. Right now, supporters of FEPC can make their ideas work because of how the U.S. government and Constitution are set up, where a majority in one region can stop or affect a majority in another.
