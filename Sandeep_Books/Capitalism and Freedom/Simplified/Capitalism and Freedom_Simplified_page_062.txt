In September 1931, Britain stopped using the gold standard. This caused gold to be taken out of the United States too. Before this, gold had been coming into the U.S. for two years, and the gold reserves were very high. The Federal Reserve noticed the gold leaving and acted quickly, unlike before when gold was leaving from inside the country.

The Federal Reserve made things harder by raising the discount rate, which is the interest rate for loans to banks. They raised it more than ever before in a short time. This stopped the gold from leaving but also caused many banks to fail and people to rush to take their money out. Between August 1931 and January 1932, about one in ten banks closed, and the money in banks dropped by 15%.

In 1932, the government tried a new plan by buying $1 billion in government bonds. This helped slow down the problem. If they had done this in 1931, it might have stopped the crisis.

But by 1932, it was too late to fix everything. When the Federal Reserve stopped helping, things got worse again. This led to the Banking Holiday in 1933, when all banks in the U.S. were closed for over a week. The system that was supposed to stop banks from closing ended up letting nearly a third of them shut down. Then, it allowed an even bigger and worse suspension of money withdrawals than before.

Even so, the Federal Reserve Board said in their 1933 report that their banks handled the huge demand for money during the crisis well, showing their system was strong.
