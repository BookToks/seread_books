It would help parents buy what they want more easily and make them spend more money than they do now, both directly and through taxes. It would stop parents from feeling annoyed about spending more on schooling because they have to follow strict rules about how the money is used. Also, people without kids in school, especially those who never will have kids in school, don’t want to pay higher taxes for things they don’t think are really about education.

About teachers' pay, the main problem isn’t that salaries are too low on average—they might actually be too high—but that pay is too similar and fixed. Bad teachers get paid way too much, and good teachers don’t get paid enough. Salaries mostly depend on how long teachers have worked, their degrees, and certificates, not how good they are.

This happens because schools are run by the government, and it gets worse when the government controls bigger areas. This is why teachers' groups want control to move from local schools to the state or even the federal government. In big government systems, standard pay scales are normal, and it’s almost impossible to pay teachers very differently based on how well they do. Teachers themselves end up having most control, while parents and local communities have less control.

In any job, like carpentry or plumbing or teaching, most workers like standard pay scales and don’t want pay based on merit because it’s safer for them.
