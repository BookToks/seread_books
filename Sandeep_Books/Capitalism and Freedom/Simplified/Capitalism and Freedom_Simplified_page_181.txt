Right now, workers only get a part of what they produce. This means that workers from the past might not have gotten their fair share either. Some people think past workers should get more, but it's not clear how that would happen, unless it's through things like fancy tombstones.

One big job of the market is to share resources without forcing anyone. But that's not the only important thing about inequality. Earlier, we talked about how inequality can give different groups power to balance out political power. It also helps protect freedom by letting people support new or unpopular ideas. 

In business, inequality helps people invest in trying new things, like buying the first cars, TVs, or new kinds of art. 

Also, the market lets stuff be shared without needing bosses to control everything. This helps people work together without force.

In a capitalist system, where people get paid based on what they produce, income and wealth are often very uneven. Some people wrongly think capitalism causes more inequality than other systems, or that inequality always grows with capitalism. This mistake comes from how income data is usually shown, mixing short-term and long-term views. Let's look at some facts about income distribution.

One surprising fact is about where income comes from. The more capitalist a country is, the smaller the part of income that comes from capital (like money or property), and the bigger the part that comes from human work and services.
