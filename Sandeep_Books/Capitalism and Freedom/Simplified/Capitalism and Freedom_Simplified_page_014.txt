In his famous speech, President Kennedy said, "Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country." 

It’s interesting that people argued about where this quote came from instead of what it really means. Both parts of the quote show a relationship between citizens and their government that doesn’t really fit the ideas of free people in a free society.

The first part, "what your country can do for you," sounds like the government is a parent and the citizen is a child. This idea goes against the free person's belief that they are responsible for their own future. 

The second part, "what you can do for your country," makes it seem like the government is a boss or a god, and the citizen is just a worker or follower. 

For a free person, the country is just the group of people who live in it, not something above or separate from them.
