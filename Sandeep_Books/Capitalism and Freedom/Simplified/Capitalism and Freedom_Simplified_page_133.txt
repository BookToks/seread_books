A monopoly happens when one person or company controls a product or service enough to decide how others can use it. In some ways, monopoly is like competition because it still involves people competing.

Monopoly causes two main problems for a free society.

First, it limits the choices people have when buying or selling things. Second, it brings up the idea of "social responsibility" for the monopoly owner. In a competitive market, no one has much power to change the rules, so they don’t have special social duties beyond following laws and doing what they think is right. But a monopolist is very powerful and noticeable.

Because of this, many believe that a monopolist should use their power not just to help themselves but to do what’s good for society.

However, if this idea was used too much, it could harm a free society.

Competition is an ideal, like a perfect straight line in math. We never see a perfect line, but we still use the idea to help us. Similarly, no competition is ever perfect. Every seller has some small impact on prices. The important question is whether this impact matters or can be ignored, like ignoring the thickness of a real line.

This depends on the problem. From studying the U.S. economy, I’ve seen many cases where it’s okay to treat the economy as if it’s competitive.

The problems with monopoly are complex, and I’m not an expert in this area.
