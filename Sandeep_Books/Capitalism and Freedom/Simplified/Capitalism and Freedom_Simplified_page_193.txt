Even now, "urban blight" is still a big problem, shown by the increasing demand for federal money to fix it.

People who supported public housing hoped it would lower youth crime by making homes better. But the program often did the opposite, even though it didn’t really improve average housing conditions. The rules about who could live in public housing, based on income, led to many "broken" families—especially divorced or widowed moms with kids—living close together.

Kids from broken families are more likely to cause trouble, and having many such kids in one place can raise youth crime. One sign of this is how public housing projects hurt nearby schools. Schools can handle a few problem kids, but not a lot. In some public housing, broken families make up a third or more of the residents, and the project might have most of the kids in the school. If these families had gotten cash help instead, they would have been spread out more across the community.

2. Minimum wage laws

Minimum wage laws are a clear example of rules that don’t work the way people expect. Many supporters hate very low pay because it shows poverty. They want to stop wages from going below a certain level to reduce poverty. But in reality, minimum wage laws often increase poverty.

The government can set a minimum wage, but it can’t make employers hire everyone who used to work for less. Employers don’t want to hire more people at higher wages.

So, minimum wage laws usually cause more unemployment than there would be otherwise. The people who lose their jobs are often the poorest, who can least afford to lose any income, even if it looked small to those supporting the minimum wage.
