Instead of doctors working alone or big hospitals run by the government or charities, there could be medical teams or companies. These teams would offer central places for tests and treatment, including hospitals. Some would be prepaid, combining hospital insurance, health insurance, and group medical practice all in one. Others would charge separately for each service. Many might use both payment methods.

These medical teams—kind of like department stores for medicine—would act as middlemen between patients and doctors. Because they would last a long time and stay in one place, they would want to build a good reputation for being reliable and high quality. People would learn to trust them. They would be experts in judging how good doctors are and help patients find the right ones, like how a department store helps people find products.

Also, these teams could organize medical care well by using doctors with different skills and training levels. They could have technicians do simpler tasks and save the most skilled doctors for the hardest jobs.

You can imagine other ideas based on what happens in big medical clinics today.

Of course, not all medical care would be done by these teams. Some doctors would still work alone, like small shops exist alongside big department stores, or individual lawyers work alongside big law firms. Some doctors would build their own reputations, and some patients would prefer seeing a private doctor for more privacy and closeness. Also, some places might be too small for medical teams.

I’m not saying medical teams would take over everything. I just want to show there are many other ways to organize medical care besides how it is now. Because no one person or small group can think of all the possibilities or decide which are best, this is a strong reason against the government controlling everything or having professional groups that stop new ideas from happening.
