The fairness reason for a different system is very clear in colleges and universities because there are many private schools. For example, Ohio tells its people: "If your kid wants to go to college, we will give them a big four-year scholarship if they meet basic education rules and choose to go to the University of Ohio. But if your kid wants to go to Oberlin College, Western Reserve University, or even Yale, Harvard, Northwestern, Beloit, or the University of Chicago, you get no money." How can this be fair?
