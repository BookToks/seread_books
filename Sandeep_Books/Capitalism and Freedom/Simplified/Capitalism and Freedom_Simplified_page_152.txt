Some jobs, like general farm work, were open to people from different social groups. This allowed people to move into jobs where workers were needed.

Today, things like tariffs, fair-trade laws, import limits, production limits, and rules made by labor unions are similar examples. In all these cases, the government decides who can do certain jobs and how they can work with others. The important thing is that the laws protect certain groups of workers or producers.

For example, licensing laws usually help groups of skilled workers like craftsmen. Other laws might protect groups that make certain products, small shop owners who want to avoid competition from big stores, or groups like oil producers, farmers, or steel workers.

Licensing for jobs is very common now. Walter Gellhorn, who studied this, said that by 1952, over 80 jobs had state licenses, not counting small businesses like restaurants or taxi companies. Cities and the federal government also have many licensing rules. In 1938, North Carolina alone licensed 60 different jobs. Jobs like pharmacists, accountants, dentists, psychologists, architects, veterinarians, and librarians all need licenses.

But some licenses are for surprising jobs, like operators of threshing machines or dealers in scrap tobacco.

What about egg graders, guide dog trainers, pest controllers, yacht salespeople, tree surgeons, well diggers, tile layers, and potato growers? Even people called hypertrichologists, who remove unwanted hair, are licensed in Connecticut, where they have a fancy name for their work.
