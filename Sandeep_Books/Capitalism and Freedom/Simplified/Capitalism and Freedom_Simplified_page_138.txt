Monopoly and Social Responsibility 125

The difference I have been explaining between labor monopoly and business monopoly is a bit too strict. Labor unions sometimes help control the sale of a product like a monopoly does. The best example is in coal mining.

The Guffey Coal Act tried to legally support coal mine owners fixing prices together. When this law was ruled illegal in the 1930s, John L. Lewis and the United Mine Workers took over. They called strikes or stopped work whenever there was too much coal above ground that could lower prices. This way, Lewis controlled how much coal was produced and kept prices up, with the coal companies quietly helping. The extra money made by this teamwork was shared between the coal owners and the miners. The miners got higher wages, but that meant fewer miners had jobs.

So, only the miners who kept their jobs shared the extra money, and many of them also got to work less. Unions can do this because they are not affected by the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Many other unions have used this to act more like businesses controlling prices than just worker groups.

The Teamsters Union is a well-known example.

3. Government and Government-Supported Monopoly

In the United States, the government does not run many businesses that sell goods. Examples include the post office, electric power from places like TVA, highways funded by gas taxes or tolls, and city water systems. Also, because the government spends a lot on defense, space, and research, it buys most products from certain industries.

This causes big problems for keeping a free society, but these problems are not the usual kind related to monopolies. The government helps set up and support cartels and monopolies among private businesses more than it runs businesses itself. This support has grown faster and is more important than direct government monopolies.
