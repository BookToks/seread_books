But even if a bank is doing well and making money, it can still get into big trouble if its customers suddenly lose trust and rush to withdraw all their money at once. Many banks that were actually fine had to shut down because of this kind of panic during money shortages talked about earlier.

These two problems are connected. One main reason people might stop trusting a bank is if the bank is losing money.

But they are also very different. Money problems usually happen slowly, so there’s time to fix them. They don’t come as a sudden shock. A run on a bank, though, can happen quickly and unexpectedly, out of nowhere.

The situation with the U.S. is very similar. People in the U.S. and the government want to use dollars to buy foreign money so they can buy things from other countries, invest abroad, pay interest, repay loans, or give gifts. At the same time, people from other countries want to get dollars with their own money for similar reasons. After everything happens, the amount of dollars spent to buy foreign money will exactly match the amount of dollars bought with foreign money—just like the number of shoes sold equals the number of shoes bought. Math doesn’t lie, and one person’s purchase is another’s sale. But there’s no guarantee that, at any price for foreign money in dollars, the amount of dollars people want to spend equals the amount others want to buy—just like there’s no guarantee that at any price, the number of shoes people want to buy matches the number people want to sell. The fact that they do match after the fact means there is some system that fixes differences before they happen. Creating a good system to do this is like the bank’s problem of managing money.

Also, the U.S. has a problem like a bank trying to avoid a run. The U.S. promised to sell gold to other countries at $35 an ounce. Foreign governments and banks keep a lot of money in the U.S. as deposits or investments.
