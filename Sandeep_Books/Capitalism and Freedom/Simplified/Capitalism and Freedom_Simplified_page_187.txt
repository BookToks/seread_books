When thinking about whether graduated income taxes are a good idea, I think it's important to look at two main issues, even though they can sometimes overlap. First, there's the need to raise money to pay for government activities, like programs to help reduce poverty. Second, there’s the idea of using taxes just to redistribute money from richer people to poorer people. 

The first reason might support some level of tax graduation, based on how much benefit people get or on fairness. But the very high tax rates on the richest incomes and inheritances today don’t really make sense because they don’t bring in much money.

As a liberal, I find it hard to support graduated taxes if they are only meant to share income differently. This feels like forcing people to give up their money to others, which goes against personal freedom.

After thinking about everything, the tax system I like best is a flat tax rate on income over a certain amount, with income defined broadly and only allowing deductions for necessary work expenses. I also think we should get rid of the corporate income tax and make corporations pass their income to shareholders, who then pay taxes on it.

Other good changes would be stopping special tax breaks on oil and other natural resources, ending tax exemptions on interest from state and local bonds, removing special rules for capital gains, coordinating income, estate, and gift taxes better, and getting rid of many current deductions.

Having a tax exemption—that is, not taxing income below a certain amount—can be a fair kind of graduation. It’s very different when most people vote to tax themselves and protect a small rich group, compared to most people voting to tax the rich much more, which is what the U.S. has often done.
