+ Preface, 2002  

In the preface to the 1982 edition of this book, I talked about how peopleâ€™s opinions changed a lot.  

This change is clear when you compare how people reacted to this book when it first came out in 1962 and how they reacted to another book my wife and I wrote called Free to Choose, which shared the same ideas and was published in 1980.
