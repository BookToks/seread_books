Instead of letting things happen naturally, the government could step in and control trade to stop people from spending too many dollars and encourage more money to come in. They could raise tariffs to limit imports, give money to help exports, set limits on how much stuff can be imported, control how much money citizens or companies invest in other countries, and use many other types of exchange controls.

These controls could affect private businesses and also government programs aimed at balancing trade. For example, countries receiving foreign aid might have to spend that aid in the U.S. The military might buy more expensive goods from the U.S. instead of cheaper ones from other countries to save "dollars," which sounds confusing but is part of the plan.

The main point is that one or more of these four methods must be used. Basically, the money going out must equal the money coming in. The only question is how to make that happen.

Our official national policy has been, and still is, that we won’t do any of these things. In December 1961, President Kennedy told the National Association of Manufacturers, "This administration has no plans to control currency exchange, lower the value of the dollar, raise trade barriers, or stop our economic recovery." Logically, this means there are only two options left: get other countries to take action, which we can’t really count on, or use up our reserves, which the President said we must avoid.

Time magazine said the President’s promise got a big cheer from the business crowd. But our policy is like someone who spends more money than they make but insists they can’t earn more, spend less, borrow, or use their savings to cover the difference!

Because we refuse to choose a clear plan, we and our trading partners—who act the same way—have had to use all four methods anyway.
