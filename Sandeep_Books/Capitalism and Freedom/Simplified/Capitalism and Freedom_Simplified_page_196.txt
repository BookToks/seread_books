The old age and survivor's insurance (OASI) program works like this: there is a special tax taken from people’s paychecks. Then, people who reach a certain age get payments. How much they get depends on when they start receiving payments, their family situation, and how much they earned before.

OASI has three main parts: 

1. Lots of people have to buy certain retirement plans, so it’s like a rule to save for old age.

2. These retirement plans must be bought from the government, which means the government controls this system.

3. The program also moves money around, so some people get more than they paid in taxes, and others get less.

These parts don’t have to be together. People could pay for their own retirement plans. They could buy them from private companies instead of the government. The government could sell retirement plans but not make anyone buy them, or it could help move money around without using retirement plans.

Let’s look at these parts one by one, starting with the last one.

1. Income redistribution means the program moves money between people. It moves money from some OASI members to others and from all taxpayers to OASI members.

The first type of money movement is mostly from people who joined the system young to people who joined late. People who joined late get more benefits than they paid for in taxes. But people who joined young get less than what they paid in.
