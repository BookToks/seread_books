The proof usually has to come from groups set up by medical organizations themselves, always, of course, thinking about what’s best for patients.

When you think about these effects, I believe that getting a license has made medical practice smaller and worse. It has made it harder for people who want to be doctors, pushing them to choose jobs they like less. It has also made people pay more money for worse medical care, and it has slowed down new technology in medicine and how doctors work together. I think getting a license should not be needed to work as a doctor.

After hearing this, many people might say, "But how else would I know if a doctor is good? Even if costs are higher, isn’t a license the only way to make sure doctors are at least okay?" The answer is partly that people don’t just pick doctors by looking at a list of licensed ones. Also, passing a test 20 or 30 years ago doesn’t guarantee a doctor is still good now. So, licenses don’t really guarantee quality today.

But the main answer is different. It shows how stuck we are in the old way of doing things and how little we imagine new ideas, even in things we know a bit about, compared to how creative the market can be. Let me explain by guessing how medicine might have grown if doctors didn’t have all the control.

Imagine if anyone could practice medicine without limits, as long as they were responsible for any harm caused by lying or carelessness. I think medicine would have grown in a very different way. Even now, the way medical care works a little bit shows what might have happened. Group doctor offices working with hospitals would have become much bigger.
