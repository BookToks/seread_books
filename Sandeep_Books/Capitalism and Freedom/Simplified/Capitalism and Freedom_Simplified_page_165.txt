Many state lawmakers, however, graduated from night law schools. If they voted to only allow people from approved schools to become lawyers, they would basically be saying they themselves aren’t qualified. Their unwillingness to question their own skills has mainly stopped law from copying medicine successfully. I haven’t studied law admission rules closely for years, but I hear this is changing. More students can afford full-time law schools now, and this is changing who gets elected.

Back to medicine, the rule that you have to graduate from an approved school is the main way the profession controls who can enter. They use this to keep the number of doctors limited. To be clear, I’m not saying that doctors or medical leaders try to limit the number of new doctors just to make more money. That’s not how it works. Even when they say they want to limit numbers to keep incomes high, they justify it by saying if too many doctors enter, incomes drop and doctors might cheat to earn enough. They believe the only way to keep doctors honest is to make sure their income is fair for their work and needs.

I’ve always found this idea wrong both ethically and factually. It’s strange that medical leaders say they need good pay to be ethical. If that were true, there would be no limit to how much they’d want. There’s little connection between being poor and being honest. In fact, dishonesty might sometimes pay off.
