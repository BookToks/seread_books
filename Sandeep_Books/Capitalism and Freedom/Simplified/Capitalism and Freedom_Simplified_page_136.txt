Monopoly and Social Responsibility 123 talks about how people often focus too much on big companies compared to small ones, and how this is just one example of a bigger issue. The main feature of our society is seen as being industrial.

This makes people pay too much attention to factories and manufacturing, even though they only make up about one-quarter of all jobs or products. Monopolies happen more in manufacturing than in other parts of the economy.

People also think monopoly is more important than it really is because they focus too much on technology that helps monopolies grow. For example, mass production is talked about a lot. But changes in transportation and communication that help competition by making markets bigger and less local don’t get as much attention. For example, the car industry is known for being controlled by a few big companies, but the growth of trucking, which helps compete with big railroads, is mostly ignored. The steel industry is also becoming less controlled by a few companies, but that’s not talked about much either.

2. Monopoly in Labor  
People also overestimate how much monopoly power labor unions have. Unions include about a quarter of all workers, which makes people think unions control wages more than they actually do. Many unions don’t have much power. Even strong unions only affect wages a little bit. It’s even clearer with labor than with industry why people overestimate monopoly power. If a union exists, any wage increase is seen as because of the union, even if it’s not. For example, wages for domestic workers have gone up a lot recently. If domestic workers had a union, people would say the union caused the increase.

This doesn’t mean unions aren’t important. Like big companies, they do affect wages and make many pay rates different from what they would be if left to the market. It’s wrong to either ignore or exaggerate their importance.
