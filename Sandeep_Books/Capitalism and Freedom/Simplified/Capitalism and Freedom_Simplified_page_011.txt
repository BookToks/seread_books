Real change only happens when there’s a crisis—whether it’s real or just seems real. When that crisis happens, the choices people make depend on the ideas that are already out there. I think our main job is to come up with different options to current policies and keep those ideas ready until what once seemed impossible becomes something that has to happen.

Let me tell you a personal story to explain this better. In the late 1960s, I had a debate at the University of Wisconsin with Leon Keyserling, who was a strong supporter of collectivism. He thought he won the debate by making fun of my views and read from the end of chapter 2 of my book, listing things I said couldn’t be justified based on my principles. He did well with the students as he criticized things like price supports and tariffs, until he got to point 11: “Conscription to man the military services in peacetime,” which means the draft. When he read that, people cheered for me, and he lost the crowd and the debate.

By the way, the draft is the only one out of my fourteen examples of bad government actions that has actually been gotten rid of—but that win isn’t completely secure. For many of the other problems, we’ve actually moved further away from the ideas I talk about in this book. This shows why people’s opinions have changed but also proves that those changes haven’t really made a big difference yet. It also shows that the main message of this book still matters just as much in 1981 as it did in 1962, even if some examples are old.
