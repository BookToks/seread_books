Chapter III: Controlling Money

"Full employment" and "economic growth" have become the main reasons for the government to get more involved in the economy over the past few decades. People say a free market economy is naturally unstable. If left alone, it will go through repeated cycles of good times and bad times. So, the government must step in to keep things steady.

These ideas were especially strong during and after the Great Depression in the 1930s. They led to the New Deal in the United States and similar government actions in other countries.

More recently, "economic growth" has become the main focus. People say the government must make sure the economy grows to support the Cold War and to show other countries that a democracy can grow faster than a communist country.
