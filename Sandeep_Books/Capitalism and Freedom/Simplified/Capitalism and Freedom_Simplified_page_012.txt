This book is based on a series of talks I gave back in June 1956 at a conference at Wabash College. The conference was run by John Van Sickle and Benjamin Rogge and was sponsored by the Volker Foundation. Over the years, I gave similar talks at other Volker conferences led by Arthur Kemp, at Claremont College with Clarence Philbrook, at the University of North Carolina with Richard Leftwich, and at Oklahoma State University. In all these talks, I explained the first two chapters of this book, which are about basic ideas, and then used those ideas to solve different special problems.

I want to thank the people who organized these conferences, not just for inviting me to speak but also for their helpful feedback and encouragement to write the talks down. I also appreciate Richard Cornuelle, Kenneth Templeton, and Ivan Bierly of the Volker Foundation, who helped set up the conferences. I’m grateful to everyone who joined the talks because their smart questions and strong interest made me rethink many things and fix mistakes. These conferences were some of the most exciting learning experiences of my life.

Of course, not everyone who organized or attended the conferences agrees with everything in this book. But I hope they won’t mind sharing some responsibility for it.
