Certification is less harmful than licensure when it comes to limiting who can work in a certain job. If people with certificates are too strict about who gets certified or if they keep the number of workers too low, the price difference between certified and non-certified workers will get so big that people will choose non-certified workers instead. In simple terms, many people will want to use non-certified workers if certified ones get too expensive, so certified workers can’t overcharge too much.

Because of this, certification without licensure is kind of a middle ground that stops one group from controlling everything. It has some downsides, but it mostly solves the usual reasons people want licensure, especially the idea that people need protection. If the problem is that people don’t know how to pick good workers, just giving out the right information is enough. If people still choose someone not certified after knowing everything, that’s their choice, and they can’t complain later. Since certification already covers most of these concerns, I find it hard to see why licensure is really needed instead.

Even registration, which is simpler than certification or licensure, has big social costs. It’s a step toward everyone having to carry ID cards and telling authorities what they plan to do before doing it. Also, registration often leads to certification and then licensure.

In the medical field, doctors have had to be licensed for a long time. At first glance, the question "Should we let bad doctors practice?" seems obvious: no, we shouldn’t.

But I want to suggest that we should think about it more carefully.
