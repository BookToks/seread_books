Taxes that try to spread money more fairly don’t always work well. In fact, they can cause problems. Some smart people spend a lot of time figuring out how to avoid paying high taxes, and others change what they do just to pay less tax. This wastes a lot of effort. What do we get from this? Mostly, some people feel good thinking the government is sharing money fairly. But even this feeling is based on not really understanding how these taxes actually work, and that feeling would go away if people knew the truth.

When it comes to how money is shared, there are better ways for the government to help than just raising taxes. A lot of money unfairness comes from problems in the market. Sometimes, the government caused these problems or could fix them. It makes sense to change the rules to stop these unfair problems. For example, when the government gives special favors to certain businesses or adds taxes on imports, it makes money unfairly go to some groups. Getting rid of these favors is something people who support fairness should like. Also, making education more available has helped reduce money unfairness. These kinds of actions are good because they fix the root problems instead of just making things look better.

The way money is shared shows how the government sometimes causes more harm than good. Some problems that people blame on private businesses are actually made worse by government actions, big or small. This shows that government involvement isn’t always the fix it’s supposed to be.
