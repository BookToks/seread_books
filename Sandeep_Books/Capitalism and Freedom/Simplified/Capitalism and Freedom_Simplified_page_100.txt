The rule can usually be followed without the government having to pay for it. Forcing a child to stay away from their parent just because the parent can’t afford the required schooling goes against the idea that families are important and that people should have freedom. Also, it could hurt the child’s chances of learning how to be a good citizen in a free society.

If most families in a community can easily pay for school, it might be a good idea to have parents pay for it themselves. In really hard cases, special help could be given to families who need it. There are many places in the United States today where this works well. In these areas, it’s better to have parents pay directly. This would stop the government from having to collect taxes from everyone all their lives and then give most of that money back when kids go to school. It would also make it less likely that the government runs the schools, which is talked about later. It would probably lower the amount of government help for school costs as people’s incomes rise. If the government still pays for most schooling, when incomes go up, even more money just moves through taxes and the government’s role grows. Lastly, having parents pay would make the costs of having kids more balanced with how much it costs society, and this might help families decide how many kids to have.

Because families have different amounts of money and different numbers of kids, and because school costs can be high, this idea doesn’t work well in many parts of the U.S. In those places and in others, it’s not so crazy to think this could affect family size. For example, one reason richer families have fewer kids than poorer ones might be because kids cost more to raise in rich families, partly because rich families spend more on school costs that they have to pay for.
