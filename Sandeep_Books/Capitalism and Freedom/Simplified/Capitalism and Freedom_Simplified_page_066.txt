When people vote on whether Mr. Jones can talk on the street corner, they don’t think about the good things that come from having a general rule that everyone can speak freely. They don’t realize that if people aren’t allowed to speak without special permission, it will stop new ideas, trying new things, and change from happening. This is clear to everyone because we are lucky to live in a society where they decided not to judge each speech separately.

The same idea applies to money and how it’s handled.

If each money problem is looked at one by one, the people in charge might make a lot of wrong choices because they only see a small part and don’t think about how all the decisions added together will affect things. But if there is one general rule for many cases, that rule helps people know what to expect and think in a better way than if decisions were made differently each time.

If we have to make a rule, what should it be? Many people who believe in freedom suggest a "price level rule," which means the government should keep prices steady. But I think this is the wrong rule. It’s wrong because the people in charge of money don’t have the clear power to keep prices stable all the time. This causes confusion about who is responsible and lets those people have too much freedom to do whatever they want. Even though money decisions affect prices, the link isn’t close or simple enough to make keeping prices steady a good daily goal for the money managers.

I have thought about what rule to make in detail somewhere else. So, I will only say a little about it here.
