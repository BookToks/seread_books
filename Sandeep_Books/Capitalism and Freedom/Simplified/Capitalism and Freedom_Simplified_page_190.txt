Chapter XI + Social Welfare Measures

The idea of being kind and fair to everyone helped create the steeply graduated income tax, where richer people pay more taxes. This same idea also led to many other programs that aim to help certain groups of people.

The most important group of these programs is called "social security," but that name can be confusing. There are also things like public housing, minimum wage laws, farm price supports, medical care for certain groups, and special aid programs.

First, I will talk a little about some of these other programs to show how their real effects can be different from what people expect. Then, I will explain in more detail the biggest part of social security, which is old age and survivor's insurance.
