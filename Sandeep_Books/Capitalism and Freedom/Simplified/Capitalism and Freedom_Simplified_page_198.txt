Basically, this argument says people can be tricked into voting for something they don’t actually want if it’s shown in a fake way. Of course, the people who say this are also the loudest when they complain about “misleading” ads on products!

Now, about making the government provide annuities (a type of payment plan): Imagine no one is making money off others by sharing money unfairly. Everyone just pays for the annuity they get, based on how long they live and interest rates. So, why should they have to buy it from the government?

If the goal was to share money fairly, the government would need to use taxes. But since sharing money isn’t part of the plan, why not let people buy annuities from private companies? Think about car insurance — some states require you to buy it, but no state makes you buy it from the government.

Some say the government could save money by selling lots of annuities because of its size. If that’s true, the government could sell them cheaper and get customers without forcing people to buy. If it can’t sell cheaper, then there’s no reason to force people to buy from them.

Here’s another example: some people want the federal government to help pay for schools, but only in the poorest states. Kids might move to other states, so that makes sense. But the laws usually give money to all states, which isn’t fair. Some supporters say the only way to help the poor states is to include everyone in the bill, even if that’s not right.
