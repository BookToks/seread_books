This idea has worked well with the balance-wheel theory. It has helped the government act faster than it could have otherwise.

Things might be very different if the balance-wheel theory was used for taxes instead of spending. Imagine if every time there was a recession, taxes were cut. Then, when the economy got better, people didn’t want taxes raised again. This might have stopped new government spending programs and reduced current ones. We could have less government spending now, and the country’s income might be bigger because lower taxes don’t slow things down as much.

I want to be clear that I’m not saying the balance-wheel theory is the best idea. In real life, even if it worked, the effects would take time and be spread out. To use it well, we’d have to predict economic ups and downs far ahead. In both tax and money policies, ignoring politics, we don’t know enough to change taxes or spending in a way that smoothly stabilizes the economy. Trying to do this often makes things worse. It’s not because we always do the wrong thing—we could fix that by doing the opposite. The problem is we add random changes that just mix with other problems. That’s what has happened before, along with some big mistakes.

What I said about money policy applies to tax and spending too: "We don’t need a perfect driver constantly steering the economy to fix every surprise. Instead, we need a way to stop the person in the back seat from grabbing the wheel and making the car swerve off the road."
