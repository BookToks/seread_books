RULES INSTEAD OF AUTHORITIES If we can achieve our objectives neither by relying on the workingofa thoroughlyautomaticgold standard nor bygiving wide discretion to independent authorities, how else can we es tablish a monetary system that is stable and at the same time free from irresponsible governmental tinkering, a system that willprovide the necessary monetaryframework for afree enter prise economy yet be incapable of being used as a source of power to threaten economic and political freedom?
 
 The only way that has yet been suggested that offers promise istotry to achieve agovernmentof lawinstead ofmen by legis lating rules for the conduct of monetary policy that will have the effect of enabling the public to exercise control over mone tary policy through its political authorities, while at the same time it will prevent monetary policy from being subject to the day-by-day whim of political authorities.
 
 The issueoflegislatingrulesfor monetarypolicyhas much in common with a topic that seems at first altogether different, namely, the argument for the first amendment to the Constitu tion. Whenever anyone suggests the desirability of a legislative rule for control over money, the stereotyped answer is that it makes little sense to tie the monetary authority's hands in this way because the authority, if it wants to, can always do of its own volition what the rule would require it to do, and in addi tion has other alternatives, hence "surely," it is said, it can do betterthantherule.Analternativeversionofthesameargument applies it to the legislature. If the legislature is willing to adopt the rule, it is said, surely it will also be willing to legislate the "right" policy in each specific case. How then, it is said, does the adoption oftherule provideany protectionagainst irrespon sible political action?
 
 The same argument could apply with only minor verbal changes tothefirst amendmenttotheConstitutionand, equally, to the entire Bill of Rights. Is it not absurd, one might say, to have a standard proscription of interference with free speech?
