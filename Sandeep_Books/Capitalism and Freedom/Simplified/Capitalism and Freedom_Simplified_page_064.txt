RULES INSTEAD OF AUTHORITIES

If we can't reach our goals by using a fully automatic gold standard or by giving a lot of power to independent authorities, how else can we create a money system that is steady and not messed with by careless government actions? We want a system that supports a free business economy but can't be used to control or threaten economic and political freedom.

The only promising idea so far is to have a government ruled by laws instead of people. This means making clear rules for how money policy works. These rules would let the public control money policy through their political leaders, but stop those leaders from changing money policy on a whim.

Making laws about money policy is similar to the idea behind the First Amendment to the Constitution. When someone says we should have rules to control money, people often argue that the money authority can just choose to do what the rules say if they want to, or even do better. They also say the same about the legislature: if they want to make a good policy, they will, so why limit them with rules? How does having rules really stop bad political decisions?

This argument is like the one against the First Amendment and the Bill of Rights. It would be strange to have a fixed rule stopping interference with free speech, some might say.
