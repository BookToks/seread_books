If an expert says yes, who can say no? More and more people are joining the social security system. Now that it can't grow much more, new programs like medical care are being added.

I think there are strong reasons against the government taking over annuities, which are plans that pay you money when you get old. This is true not just based on freedom, but also from the ideas of people who support welfare programs. If they believe the government can do better than private companies, then the government should compete with them openly. If the government is better, it will succeed. If not, people will be better off having private options. Only someone who really believes in strong government control would support the government running annuities completely.

3. Forcing people to buy annuities is the main issue now.

One reason to make people do this is because of paternalism. This means that even though people could decide for themselves, they are often short-sighted and don’t plan for the future. "We" know better than they do what’s good for them, so if enough people agree, they can force everyone to do what’s best. This kind of control is meant for responsible adults, not kids or people who can’t make decisions.

This idea makes sense on its own. Someone who believes this way can’t be convinced they are wrong just by logic. They want a kind of dictatorship, maybe a kind that is kind and chosen by most people, but a dictatorship all the same.
