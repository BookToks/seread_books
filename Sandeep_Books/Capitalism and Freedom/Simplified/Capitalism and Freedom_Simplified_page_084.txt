International Trade Arrangements  
ELIMINATING U.S. RESTRICTIONS ON TRADE  

A system like the one explained here would fix the balance of payments problem for good. There would be no deficits that make government leaders ask other countries or banks for help. The U.S. President wouldn’t have to act like a stressed-out banker trying to save his bank or force import limits while saying they support free trade. Important national and personal interests wouldn’t be sacrificed over small issues like the name of the currency used for payments. Payments would always balance because the price—the foreign exchange rate—would adjust freely. No one could sell dollars unless someone else wanted to buy them, and vice versa.

A system with floating exchange rates would help us move straight toward complete free trade in goods and services, except for cases where political or military reasons justify blocking trade, like banning strategic goods to communist countries. As long as we stick to fixed exchange rates, we can’t fully embrace free trade. We’d have to keep tariffs or controls as backup plans if needed.

Floating exchange rates also show why the common argument against free trade is wrong. People say tariffs are needed to protect “high” wages here because of “low” wages somewhere else. But whether 100 yen an hour in Japan is high or low compared to $4 an hour in the U.S. depends on the exchange rate.

What decides the exchange rate? It’s the need to balance payments, meaning what we sell to Japan should be about the same as what they sell to us.

Imagine only Japan and the U.S. trade with each other. At an exchange rate of 1,000 yen to the dollar, Japan could make every product cheaper than the U.S. At that rate, Japan could sell a lot to us, but we couldn’t sell anything to them.
