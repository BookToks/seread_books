70 CAPITALISM AND FREEDOM

4. A big problem with completely ending the gold and wheat price-support programs is deciding what to do with the government’s stored supplies. I think the government should immediately bring back a free market by starting steps 1 and 2, and eventually get rid of all its stocks.

But it’s probably better if the government gets rid of its stocks slowly. For wheat, I think five years is enough time, so I suggest the government sells one-fifth of its stocks each year for five years. This timeline seems good for gold too. So, I suggest the government sell its gold stocks in auctions over five years. If there is a free gold market, people might prefer gold warehouse certificates over actual gold. If that happens, private companies can store the gold and issue certificates. Why should the government be in charge of storing gold and giving out certificates?

5. The U.S. should also say it won’t set official exchange rates between the dollar and other currencies, and it won’t try to influence these rates by trading or other actions.

Instead, exchange rates should be decided by free markets.

6. These ideas don’t fit with our official role in the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which requires us to set an official dollar value. But the IMF allowed Canada to float its currency without setting an official value. So, there’s no reason why the U.S. can’t do the same.

7. Other countries can decide to link their money to the dollar if they want. That’s their choice, and we shouldn’t object as long as we don’t promise to buy or sell their currency at a fixed rate. They can only keep their currency linked to ours by using methods like managing reserves, matching their policies with U.S. policies, or controlling trade.
