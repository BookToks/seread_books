I once guessed that because of unions, about 10 to 15 percent of workers got their wages raised by around 10 to 15 percent. This means that about 85 to 90 percent of workers had their wages lowered by about 4 percent. Since I made these guesses, other people have done more detailed studies. I think their results are pretty similar to mine.

If unions raise wages in a certain job or industry, there will be fewer jobs available there than if wages were lowerâ€”just like when prices go up, people buy less.

This causes more people to look for other jobs, which lowers wages in those other jobs. Since unions are usually strongest in jobs that already pay well, they make high-paid workers earn more but hurt lower-paid workers.

So, unions not only hurt the public and workers overall by messing up how labor is used, they also make income differences bigger by cutting down chances for the poorest workers.

There is an important difference between unions and big companies having control. Big companies have not become more powerful over the last 50 years, but unions have. Unions got a lot stronger during World War I, got weaker in the 1920s and early 1930s, then got much stronger during the New Deal. They kept their strength during and after World War II. More recently, unions have stayed the same or gotten smaller. This is not because unions are weaker in certain jobs but because the jobs where unions are strong are becoming less common compared to jobs where unions are weak.
