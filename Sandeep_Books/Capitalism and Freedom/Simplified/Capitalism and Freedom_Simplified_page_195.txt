At most, only the extra money adds to his income. Even this extra amount is too high because the program has kept more people on farms than would have stayed otherwise.

Only the extra money they can make on the farm because of the price-support program, compared to what they could earn elsewhere, is a real benefit to them. The main result of the purchase program has been to increase farm output, not to raise farmers' income.

Some costs of the farm purchase program are obvious and well-known: consumers pay twice, once through taxes for farm payments, and again by paying higher food prices. Farmers have had to deal with strict rules and lots of control. The country has also had to deal with a growing bureaucracy. But there is one cost that many people don't know about. The farm program has made it harder to carry out good foreign policy. To keep domestic prices higher than world prices, the government had to limit imports. Changing these rules suddenly has hurt other countries. For example, high cotton prices made other countries grow more cotton.

When our high prices caused too much cotton to pile up, we sold it overseas at low prices, causing big losses for producers we had encouraged to grow more cotton. There are many similar examples.

I want to look at the biggest part of it, the payments to older people.
