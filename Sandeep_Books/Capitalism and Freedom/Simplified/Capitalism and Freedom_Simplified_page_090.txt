Fiscal Policy 77 It’s kind of weird that the federal budget is supposed to help balance the economy, but the part of national income that changes the most after the war is actually federal spending. Instead of helping to smooth things out, the federal budget has often made things more unstable.

Because government spending is such a big part of the whole economy, the government can’t avoid affecting the economy a lot. So, first of all, the government needs to get its own spending under control and keep it steady. If it did that, it would help the rest of the economy adjust more easily. Until then, it’s kind of silly for government officials to act like they’re scolding others for being messy. Of course, it’s not surprising — blaming others for your own problems is something people do everywhere, even in government.

Even if you believe the federal budget should be used to balance the economy — which I’ll talk about more later — it doesn’t have to be done by changing spending. Taxes can do the job too. When the economy slows down, people earn less, so the government collects less tax money, which naturally creates a budget deficit. When the economy is booming, the government collects more taxes. If you want to do more, taxes could be lowered during recessions and raised during good times. But politics might make it easier to lower taxes than to raise them.

If the government has tried to balance the economy by changing spending, it’s mostly because other things have pushed spending up. For example, many smart people believe the government should have a bigger role in the economy and people’s lives — this idea is called the welfare state.
