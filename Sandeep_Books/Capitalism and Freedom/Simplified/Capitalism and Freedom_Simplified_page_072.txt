Lately, things have changed. The official price of gold is still $35, but the prices of other things have gone up two or three times. So, $35 is now less than what gold would cost if the market set the price. Because of this, there is a "shortage" of gold instead of extra supply. This happens for the same reason rent controls cause a shortage of houses — the government is keeping the gold price lower than it should be.

The price of gold hasn’t been raised like wheat prices have because the main gold producers are Soviet Russia and South Africa. The United States doesn’t have good political relations with these countries, so it hasn’t been easy to change the price.

Government control of gold prices, like controlling any price, doesn’t work well in a free economy. This kind of fake gold standard is very different from a real gold standard, where gold is used as money freely, which fits a free economy even if it might not be practical. When the Roosevelt administration raised the gold price in 1933 and 1934, they also made big changes that went against free-market ideas. These included taking control of all gold, banning private ownership of gold for money, and canceling gold promises in contracts.

In 1933 and early 1934, people who owned gold had to give it to the government by law. They were paid based on the old price, which was lower than the market price at that time. To make this work, private ownership of gold was made illegal except for art. This was a very harmful action against economic freedom.
