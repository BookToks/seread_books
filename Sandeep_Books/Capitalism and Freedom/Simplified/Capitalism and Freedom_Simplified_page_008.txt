It is hard for people who were alive back then, especially those who were kids or not born yet, to understand what people were thinking at that time. Those of us who worried a lot about freedom and money problems because of the government getting bigger and ideas about welfare and economics becoming popular were a small group. Most other smart people thought we were strange.

Even seven years later, when this book first came out, most big newspapers and magazines didn’t talk about it. Not the New York Times, the Herald Tribune, the Chicago Tribune, Time, Newsweek, or the Saturday Review. But it was noticed by some important magazines in London and professional groups. This was strange because the book was meant for regular people in the U.S., written by a respected university professor, and it ended up selling over 400,000 copies in 18 years. It’s hard to believe a book supporting welfare or socialism by a similar expert would have been ignored like that.

The way people think about these ideas has changed a lot in the last 25 years. This is shown by how differently people reacted to a book my wife and I wrote in 1980 called Free to Choose. It follows the same ideas as Capitalism and Freedom but got a much better response.
