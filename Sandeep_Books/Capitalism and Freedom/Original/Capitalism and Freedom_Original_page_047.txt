Yetthere is'nouse pretending thatproblems are simpler than in fact they are.Thereis noavoidingtheneedfor somemeasureofpaternal ism. As Dicey wrote in 1914 about an act for the protection of mental defectives, "The Mental Deficiency Act is the first step along a path on which no sane man can decline to enter, but which, iftoofar pursued,will bring statesmen across difficulties hard to meet without considerable interference with individual liberty." Thereis noformula thatcantell uswhere tostop.We 1 mustrely on our fallible judgmentand, having reached a judg ment, on our ability to persuade ourfellow men that it is a cor rect judgment, or their ability to persuade us to modify our views. We must put our faith, here as elsewhere, in a consensus reached by imperfect and biased men through free discussion and trial and error.

The consistent liberal is not an anarchist.
