176 CAPITALISM AND FREEDOM alsomust be their redistributive effects. This does not mean that they do no harm. On the contrary. The yield is so low partly because some of the most competent men in the country devote their energies to devising ways to keep it so low; and because many other men shape their activities with one eye on tax ef fects. All this issheerwaste.Andwhatdowegetfor it? Atmost, a feeling of satisfaction on the part of some that the state is re distributing income. And even this feeling is founded on igno rance of the actual effects of the graduated tax structure, and wouldsurelyevaporateifthefactswereknown.
 
 To return to the distribution of income, there is a clear justi fication for social action of a very different kind than taxation to affect the distribution ofincome. Much ofthe actual inequal ity derives from imperfections of the market. Many of these have themselves been created by government action or could be removed by government action. There is every reason to adjust the rules of the game so as to eliminate these sources of in equality. For example, special monopoly privileges granted by government, tariffs, and other legal enactments benefiting par ticular groups, are a source of inequality. The removal ofthese, the liberal will welcome. The extension and widening of edu cational opportunities has been amajor factor tending to reduce inequalities. Measures such as these have the operational virtue that they strike at the sources of inequality rather than simply alleviatingthesymptoms.
 
 The distribution of income is still another area in which government has been doing more harm by one set of measures than it has been able to undo by others. It is another exampleof the justification of government intervention in terms of alleged defects of the private enterprise system when many of the phe nomena of which champions of big government complain are themselves the creation ofgovernment, big and small.
