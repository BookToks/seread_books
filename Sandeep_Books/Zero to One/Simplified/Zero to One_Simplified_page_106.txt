SUBSTITUTION VS. COMPLEMENTARITY

Fifteen years ago, American workers were worried about losing jobs to cheaper workers in Mexico. This made sense because people can replace each other in jobs. Today, people hear about job losses again, but this time they blame big computer centers in Texas instead of factories in Mexico. Americans are scared of technology because they think it will cause the same problems as globalization did before. But this is different: people compete for jobs and resources, while computers don’t compete for either.

Globalization Means Substitution

When Ross Perot warned about foreign competition, both Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton supported free trade. The idea was that everyone is good at certain jobs, so if people focus on what they do best and trade, the economy grows. But in real life, free trade hasn’t worked perfectly for many workers. Trade helps most when some countries are much better at certain jobs, but there are a lot of workers worldwide willing to do simple jobs for very low pay.

People don’t just compete to work; they also want the same things. Americans got cheaper toys and clothes from China, but they also had to pay more for gas because more Chinese people started driving cars. Everyone needs food and homes, whether they live in Shanghai or San Diego. As globalization continues, people want more than just basics. For example, as millions of Chinese farmers get enough food, they want to eat more meat, like pork, instead of just grains. Rich people everywhere want the same fancy things, like Cristal champagne, whether they live in Russia or North Korea.

Technology Means Complementarity

Now think about computers competing with people. Computers and people are very different. People can plan and make decisions in tricky situations, but they aren’t great at handling huge amounts of data. Computers are the opposite: they are great at processing lots of data quickly but bad at making simple judgments that humans find easy.

To see how different they are, look at a Google project from 2012. Their supercomputer looked at 10 million YouTube thumbnails and learned to recognize cats with 75% accuracy. That sounds good, but a four-year-old child can do it perfectly. Sometimes a cheap laptop can beat the smartest mathematicians at certain tasks, but even a supercomputer with 16,000 processors can’t beat a child at others. This shows that humans and computers are not just stronger or weaker than each other—they are totally different kinds of thinkers.
