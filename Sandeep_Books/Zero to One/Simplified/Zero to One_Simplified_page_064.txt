This graph shows a big difference between what people think and what really happens: At Founders Fund, our results show this clearly. Facebook, the best investment in our 2005 fund, made more money than all the other investments combined. Palantir, the second-best, is expected to make more than all the others except Facebook. This kind of uneven result is normal—we see it in all our other funds too. The biggest secret in venture capital is that the best investment in a good fund does as well or better than all the other investments put together.

This means venture capitalists (VCs) have two strange rules. First, only invest in companies that could make as much money as the entire fund. This rule is scary because it rules out most investments. Even successful companies usually grow more slowly. So, the second rule is: since the first rule is so strict, there can’t be any other rules.

Think about what happens if you don’t follow the first rule. In 2010, Andreessen Horowitz put $250,000 into Instagram. Two years later, Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion, and Andreessen made $78 million—a 312 times return in less than two years. That’s amazing and shows why they are a top firm. But strangely, it’s still not enough because their fund is $1.5 billion. If they only gave $250,000 checks, they’d need to find 19 Instagrams just to break even. That’s why investors usually put a lot more money into companies worth funding. (Andreessen would have invested more in Instagram later, but couldn’t because of a conflict with another investment.) VCs must find the few companies that can grow from nothing to huge and support them fully.

Of course, no one can know for sure which companies will succeed, so even the best VCs invest in a group of companies, or a “portfolio.” But every company in a good portfolio has to have the chance to grow really big. At Founders Fund, we pick five to seven companies per fund that we believe could become multibillion-dollar businesses because of what makes them special. When you stop looking at the company itself and start thinking about spreading risk like a financial strategy, venture investing starts to feel like buying lottery tickets. And once you think you’re playing the lottery, you’re already ready to lose.
