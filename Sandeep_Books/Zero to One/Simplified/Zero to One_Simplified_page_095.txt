E is everywhere, but most people don’t realize how important it is. Silicon Valley, where lots of tech stuff happens, often ignores it even more than others.

In the book The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, the story shows how Earth was made because of salespeople. When people had to leave their old home, they escaped on three big ships. The smart and powerful people took the A Ship. The salespeople and consultants got the B Ship. The workers and artists took the C Ship. The B Ship left first, and the salespeople were happy. But they didn’t know the A and C Ship people wanted to get rid of them because they thought salespeople didn’t matter. In the end, it was the B Ship that landed on Earth.

In real life, how you sell and share products—called distribution—really matters. We often think salespeople and middlemen just get in the way. Many believe that if you make a good product, people will buy it automatically. This idea is popular in Silicon Valley, where engineers like to focus on creating cool things, not selling them. But customers won’t just show up because you built something. You have to work hard to make that happen, and it’s not easy.
