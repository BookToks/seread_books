CAN YOU CONTROL YOUR FUTURE?

You can think of the future as something clear and planned, or as something confusing and uncertain. If you believe the future is clear, it makes sense to understand it early and try to shape it. But if you think the future is random and unclear, you might stop trying to control it.

Not being sure about the future is a big problem in today’s world. People focus more on following rules than on real plans. When they don’t have clear goals, they just collect different options instead. This is how many Americans act today. In middle school, kids are told to join lots of activities. In high school, students work even harder to seem good at everything. By the time they reach college, they have a long list of different things they’ve done to get ready for a future they can’t predict. They’re prepared, but not for anything specific.

On the other hand, having a clear idea means having strong beliefs. Instead of trying to be average at many things and calling it “well-rounded,” a person with a clear plan picks the one best thing to focus on and works hard at it. Instead of trying to be like everyone else, they try to be really great at something special. But young people today don’t usually do this because most have lost faith in a certain future. You don’t get into schools like Stanford by being great at just one thing—unless it’s a sport like football.

You can also think the future will be better or worse than now. Optimists look forward to the future; pessimists worry about it. Combining these ideas gives four ways to see the future: One is Indefinite Pessimism. Every culture has a story about how things used to be better, and most people in history have been pessimistic.
