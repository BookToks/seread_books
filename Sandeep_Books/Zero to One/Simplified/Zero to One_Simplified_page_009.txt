ZERO TO ONE: THE FUTURE OF PROGRESS

When we think about the future, we want things to get better. There are two ways this can happen. One way is called horizontal progress, which means copying things that already work—going from 1 to many.

Horizontal progress is easy to understand because we’ve seen it before. The other way is vertical progress, which means doing something totally new—going from 0 to 1. Vertical progress is harder to imagine because it means creating something no one has ever done before. For example, if you take one typewriter and make 100, that’s horizontal progress. But if you start with a typewriter and invent a word processor, that’s vertical progress.

On a big scale, horizontal progress is called globalization—taking things that work in one place and making them work everywhere. China is a good example of this. Their 20-year plan is to become like the United States today. They have been copying everything that worked in developed countries: old railroads, air conditioning, and even whole cities. Sometimes they skip steps, like going straight to wireless phones without using landlines, but they’re still copying.

Vertical progress, going from 0 to 1, is called technology. The fast progress in computers and information technology has made Silicon Valley the center of technology. But technology doesn’t have to be just about computers. It means any new and better way of doing things.
