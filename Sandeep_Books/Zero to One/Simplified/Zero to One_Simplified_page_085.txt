Startups don’t have to pay high salaries because they can offer something better: a piece of the company. This is called equity. Equity is a type of payment that can make people want to help the company grow in the future.

But to make equity work without causing fights, you have to give it out very carefully.

Giving everyone the same amount is usually a bad idea. People have different skills, jobs, and what they give up to work there, so equal shares feel unfair. But giving different amounts right away can also cause problems. If people feel upset early on, it can ruin the company. There’s no perfect way to share ownership that stops this.

The problem gets worse as more people join. Early workers get more equity because they take bigger risks, but some who join later might be even more important. For example, a secretary at eBay in 1996 might have made 200 times more than her boss who joined in 1999. A graffiti artist who painted Facebook’s walls in 2005 got stock worth $200 million, while a great engineer joining in 2010 might have made only $2 million. Since you can’t make ownership perfectly fair, founders usually keep these details secret.

Sending out an email that shows everyone’s shares would cause a huge mess.

Most people don’t even want equity. At PayPal, we hired a consultant who was supposed to help make deals. He only wanted a $5,000 daily cash salary and refused to take stock options. Even though some startup workers become millionaires, many people don’t like equity. It’s not like cash you can spend right away.

Equity is tied to one company. If that company fails, the equity is worthless.

Equity is powerful because of these limits. People who want equity instead of cash care about the company’s future and want to help it grow. Equity can’t make perfect rewards, but it’s the best way for founders to keep everyone working toward the same goals.
