He didn’t have any clearer ideas about a perfect society than Rawls did: both of them cared more about the process. Today, we blow up the differences between left-leaning equality ideas and libertarian individualism because almost everyone actually shares a vague, unclear attitude. In philosophy, politics, and business, arguing about how to do things has become a way to avoid making real plans for a better future.

Our ancestors wanted to understand and live longer lives. In the 1500s, explorers looked for the Fountain of Youth in Florida’s jungles. Francis Bacon said that living longer should be its own part of medicine—and the most important part. In the 1660s, Robert Boyle put life extension and “getting youth back” at the top of his science goals. Whether by exploring new places or doing experiments, smart people during the Renaissance thought death was something to beat. (Some even died trying: Bacon died from pneumonia in 1626 while testing if freezing a chicken could make it live longer.) We still don’t know all the secrets of life, but in the 1800s, insurance experts and statisticians found a secret about death: they figured out how to turn it into math and chance. “Life tables” show us the chance we might die each year, something people didn’t know before. But in exchange for better insurance, we stopped trying to find real secrets about living longer. Knowing how long people usually live made death seem normal. Today, most people believe death is both something that will definitely happen and something that happens by chance.

At the same time, this chance-based thinking has shaped biology itself. In 1928, a Scottish scientist named Alexander Fleming found a strange antibacterial mold growing on a petri dish he forgot to cover: he accidentally discovered penicillin. Since then, scientists have tried to use luck like this on purpose. Modern drug research tries to copy Fleming’s lucky accident millions of times by testing random mixes of chemicals, hoping to find something that works.

But this hasn’t worked as well recently. Even though we made big progress in the last 200 years, biotech hasn’t lived up to what investors or patients hoped for lately. Eroom’s law (which is Moore’s law backward) shows that the number of new drugs made for every billion dollars spent has dropped by half every nine years since 1950. Since information technology improved faster than ever during these years, biotech’s big question now is whether it will ever get better like that. Compared to computer software startups, biotech startups are a clear example of vague, indefinite thinking.
