Some qualities people have can be there from birth (nature) or picked up from their surroundings (nurture). But maybe founders arenâ€™t as different as they seem. 

Maybe they just show off certain traits on purpose. Or maybe everyone else makes those traits seem bigger than they really are. 

All these things can happen at once and make each other stronger. 

This usually starts with people who are a bit different and makes them act and seem even more different. For example, look at Sir Richard Branson, the billionaire who started the Virgin Group.
