DO ONE THING Inside a company, every person should have a clear and different job.

When you give tasks to people in a startup, you might think it’s just about matching the right skills to the right jobs. But even if you do this perfectly, it won’t last long. Startups move fast, so people’s jobs change a lot. Also, job assignments aren’t just about tasks; they’re about how people work together too.

The best thing I did as a boss at PayPal was to make sure each person was in charge of only one thing. Everyone’s one thing was different, and they knew I would only judge them based on that. I started this to make managing easier, but I saw something else happen: it stopped fights. Most arguments happen when people want to do the same job. Startups have this problem a lot because jobs are always changing. When you stop people from competing, it helps them build strong relationships that go beyond just work.

More importantly, peace inside the company helps a startup survive. When startups fail, we often think it’s because of tough outside competition. But every company is like its own small world, and fights inside make it weak. Internal conflict is like a disease inside the body: the visible cause of death might be something else, but the real problem is hidden inside.
