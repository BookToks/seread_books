Being lonely but sure you’re right—spending your life working on something nobody else believes in—is already tough. But being lonely and wrong is even harder to handle.

Next is being too comfortable. Rich and powerful people have the most freedom to try new ideas, but they don’t seem to believe in hidden secrets much. Why look for new secrets if you can just enjoy what’s already been done? Every year, the leaders at top law and business schools tell new students: “You got into this fancy school. You don’t have to worry anymore. Your future is secure.” But that might only be true if you don’t actually believe it.

Another problem is “flatness.” As the world becomes more connected, people see it as one big, super competitive place: the world is “flat.” So, if someone wants to find a secret, they might first think: if it was possible to discover something new, wouldn’t someone smarter from the huge global talent pool have found it already? This doubt can stop people from even trying to find secrets because the world feels too big for one person to do something special.

There’s a hopeful way to look at these trends: today, you can’t start a cult. Forty years ago, people were more open to the idea that not all knowledge was known by everyone. Big groups like the Communist Party or the Hare Krishnas attracted people who believed they had found the truth. Now, hardly anyone takes strange new ideas seriously, and most people see that as progress. We can be happy there are fewer crazy cults today, but that comes with a big downside: we’ve lost some of our excitement about discovering hidden secrets.
