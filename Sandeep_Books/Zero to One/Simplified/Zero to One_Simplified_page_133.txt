Here’s another example: Sean Parker started out as an outsider because he was a criminal. In high school, Sean was a careful hacker. But his dad thought Sean was spending too much time on the computer when he was 16, so one day he took away Sean’s keyboard while he was hacking. Sean couldn’t log out, the FBI saw what was happening, and soon federal agents came to arrest him.

Sean got lucky because he was a minor, and the experience actually made him braver. Three years later, he helped start Napster. This file-sharing service got 10 million users in its first year, making it one of the fastest-growing businesses ever. But the music companies sued, and a judge shut it down 20 months later. After that crazy time, Sean was an outsider again.

Then came Facebook. Sean met Mark Zuckerberg in 2004, helped get Facebook’s first money, and became its first president. He had to leave in 2005 because of drug use rumors, but this made him even more famous. Since Justin Timberlake played him in The Social Network movie, Sean has been seen as one of the coolest people in America. JT is still more famous, but when he visits Silicon Valley, people ask if he’s Sean Parker.
