But these surface-level tricks don’t work without something strong underneath. Apple has a lot of special technology, both in hardware (like better touchscreen materials) and software (like touchscreen designs made for certain materials). It makes products on such a big scale that it controls the prices of the materials it buys. Plus, it has a strong network effect with its content: thousands of developers create apps for Apple devices because millions of people use them, and those users stick with Apple because that’s where the apps are. These hidden advantages are not as obvious as Apple’s cool brand, but they are the real reasons the brand helps Apple stay on top.

Starting with the brand instead of the product is risky. Since Marissa Mayer became CEO of Yahoo! in 2012, she has tried to make the company popular again by making it seem cool. Yahoo! summed up her plan in a tweet like this: “people then products then traffic then revenue.” First, people come because it’s cool.

Yahoo! showed it cared about design by changing its logo, tried to seem young by buying trendy startups like Tumblr, and got media attention because of Mayer’s fame. But the big question is what products Yahoo! will actually make. When Steve Jobs came back to Apple, he didn’t just try to make Apple cool; he cut down the number of products and focused on a few that could improve a lot. No tech company can succeed by just having a cool brand.
