SMARTER COMPUTERS: GOOD OR BAD?

The future of computers is full of unknown stuff. We often think of smart robots like Siri and Watson as signs of what’s coming next. When computers can answer all our questions, maybe they’ll even wonder why they should always listen to us.

The idea of “strong AI” means computers that are smarter than humans in every way. Some people are really scared of this. Even experts aren’t sure if strong AI would help people or cause big problems.

Technology is supposed to help us control nature and make life less random. But super-smart computers might actually bring back a lot of uncertainty.

Strong AI is like a huge gamble: if it works out, we get a perfect world; if it doesn’t, machines might take over and get rid of us.

But strong AI probably won’t happen for a long time—maybe not until the 22nd century. We shouldn’t let worries about the far future stop us from making good choices now. Some people say we shouldn’t build computers that could replace humans, while others say we should. Both ideas are extreme, but there’s a middle ground where smart people can use computers to make the world way better.

As computers get smarter, they won’t just do what humans already do better—they’ll help us do things we never thought possible before.
