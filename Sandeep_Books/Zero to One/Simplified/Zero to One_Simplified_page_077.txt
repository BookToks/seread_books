WHAT TO DO WITH SECRETS

If you find out a secret, you have to decide: Should you tell someone or keep it to yourself?

It depends on the secret. Some secrets can be really risky. As Faust says to Wagner: People who show their true feelings and share what they know often get hurt or judged.

If you don’t believe in sharing everything, it’s usually not smart to tell everyone all your secrets.

So who should you tell? Only the people you need to, and no more. Usually, there’s a balance between telling no one and telling everyone—this balance is like a group or team. Smart business people know this: every successful company has a secret that they keep from outsiders. A great company is like a team with a secret plan to change the world; when you share your secret, the person you tell becomes part of that team.

As Tolkien said in The Lord of the Rings: The road keeps going down from where it started.

Life is a long journey, and the path made by those before us doesn’t seem to end.

But later in the story, another part says: There might be new roads or secret doors around the corner, and even if we don’t notice them now, one day we might take those hidden paths that lead to amazing places.

So the road doesn’t have to go on forever. Sometimes, you should take the hidden paths.
