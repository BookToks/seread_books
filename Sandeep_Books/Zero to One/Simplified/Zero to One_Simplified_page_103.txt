EVERYBODY SELLS Nerds might wish that selling and salespeople didn’t matter, or that they could be sent far away. We all like to think we decide things on our own and that sales tricks don’t affect us. But that’s not true.

Everyone has something to sell—whether you work for a company, started one, or invested money in one.

This is true even if your whole company is just you and your computer. Look around you. If you don’t see any salespeople, then you are the salesperson.
