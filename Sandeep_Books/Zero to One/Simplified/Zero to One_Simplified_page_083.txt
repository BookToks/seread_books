ON THE BUS OR OFF THE BUS

As a rule, everyone involved with your company should work full-time. Sometimes you have to make exceptions, like hiring outside lawyers or accountants. 

But anyone who doesn’t get stock options or a regular paycheck from your company usually doesn’t have the same goals as you. They might focus on getting quick benefits instead of helping the company grow in the long run. 

That’s why hiring consultants or part-time workers usually doesn’t work. Even working from home can cause problems because people aren’t together all the time in the same place. 

When you decide to bring someone into your team, it’s a clear choice. Ken Kesey was right: you’re either on the bus or off the bus.
