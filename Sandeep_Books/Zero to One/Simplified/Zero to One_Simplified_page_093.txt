In the most intense groups, people only spend time with other members. They ignore their families and stay away from the outside world. In return, they feel like they belong and might learn special “truths” that regular people don’t know. We call these groups cults. Cults seem strange to outsiders, partly because some famous cults were violent, like Jim Jones and Charles Manson.

But business leaders should take these extreme groups seriously. Is being only a little interested in your work really healthy? Is just doing your job without passion the best way? The opposite of a cult is a consulting company like Accenture. These companies don’t have a strong mission, and their workers move between different businesses without long-term ties.

Every company culture fits somewhere on a line: the best startups are kind of like less intense cults. The big difference is that cults are strongly wrong about something important, while people at successful startups are strongly right about something others don’t understand. You won’t learn those special secrets from consultants, and it’s okay if regular professionals don’t get your company. It’s better to be called a cult—or even a mafia.
