So, he’s more likely to reward himself by having control over stuff rather than caring about the real value of owning it.

Getting good quarterly results is enough for him to keep his high salary and the company jet.

Even if he gets stock as a reward for “shareholder value,” problems can still happen. If the stock is for short-term success, he’ll prefer to save money now instead of investing in a plan that could help the company grow a lot later.

Startups are small, so founders usually both own and control the company. Most fights happen between owners and those in charge, like founders and investors on the board. Over time, conflicts get worse because their goals change: a board member might want to take the company public quickly to make money, while founders want to keep it private and grow it first.

In meetings, smaller boards work better. With fewer people, it’s easier to talk, agree, and watch over the company. But a small board can also strongly oppose management if there’s a fight. That’s why picking board members carefully is super important. Even one bad member can cause big problems and risk your company.

Having three people on the board is best. Don’t have more than five unless your company is public. Public companies usually have bigger boards because of rules, usually around nine members. The worst thing is having a huge board. When people see a nonprofit with tons of board members, they think it’s well-run. But actually, big boards don’t watch over things well and just let one boss do whatever they want. If you want your board to really work, keep it small.
