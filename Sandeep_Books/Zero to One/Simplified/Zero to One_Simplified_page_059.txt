THE RETURN OF DESIGN What would it mean to focus on design instead of just luck? Today, “good design” is really important, and everyone from lazy people to busy professionals carefully chooses how they look.

It’s true that every great entrepreneur is mainly a designer. Anyone who has used an iPhone or a smooth MacBook has felt Steve Jobs’s obsession with making things look and feel perfect. But the most important thing to learn from Jobs isn’t about looks. The best thing Jobs designed was his business. Apple made clear plans for many years to create new products and sell them well. Forget “minimum viable products”—since he started Apple in 1976, Jobs believed you could change the world by planning carefully, not by copying others or listening only to focus groups.

Long-term planning is often ignored in our short-term world. When the first iPod came out in October 2001, experts thought it was just “a nice feature for Mac users” and “didn’t matter” to most people. But Jobs planned the iPod to be the first of a new kind of portable devices after computers, even though most people didn’t see this. Just looking at Apple’s stock shows how well this plan worked. Planning well also explains why it’s hard to figure out how much private companies are worth. When a big company offers to buy a successful startup, they usually offer too much or too little: founders only sell when they have no clear plans left, so the buyer probably paid too much; strong founders with solid plans don’t sell, meaning the offer wasn’t good enough. When Yahoo! offered to buy Facebook for $1 billion in July 2006, I thought we should think about it. But Mark Zuckerberg told the board, “This is just a formality, it won’t take long. We’re obviously not selling.” Mark knew where he wanted to take Facebook, but Yahoo! didn’t. A business with a strong plan will always be underrated in a world where people think the future is random.
