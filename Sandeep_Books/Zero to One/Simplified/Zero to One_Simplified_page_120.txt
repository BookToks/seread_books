They found out the hard way that the world isn’t a science experiment: selling and delivering a product is just as important as making the product itself.

Just look at the Israeli electric car company Better Place. From 2007 to 2012, they raised and spent over $800 million to build battery packs you could swap out and charging stations for electric cars. The company wanted to create a green option that would reduce our need for dirty transportation. They did sell about 1,000 cars before going bankrupt, which was a big deal because those cars were really hard for people to buy.

First, it wasn’t clear what you were actually buying. Better Place took sedans from Renault and changed them to electric cars. So, were you buying an electric Renault or a Better Place car? If you wanted to buy one, you had to jump through a lot of hoops. You had to get approval from Better Place by proving you lived near a battery swapping station and promised to drive on certain routes. If you passed, you had to sign up for a subscription to recharge your car. Only then could you start learning to swap battery packs on the road.

Better Place thought their technology was so good it didn’t need clear advertising.

Looking back, one unhappy customer asked, “Why wasn’t there a billboard in Tel Aviv showing a Toyota Prius for 160,000 shekels and this car for 160,000 plus fuel for four years?” He still bought one, but he was a fan who “would do anything to keep driving it.” Sadly, he can’t anymore. When Better Place sold its assets for only $12 million in 2013, the board said, “We solved the technical problems, but couldn’t overcome the other challenges.” Every business owner should plan to be the last one standing in their market.
