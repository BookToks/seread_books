This means Tesla’s lead will probably get bigger in the next few years. Having a popular brand shows Tesla has made a big breakthrough. Buying a car is one of the biggest choices people make, and it’s hard to get their trust. Unlike other car companies, Tesla’s founder is still in charge, so the company will keep pushing hard.

Tesla knew that style was important for getting people interested in clean technology. Rich people especially wanted to look “green,” even if they had to drive cars like the boxy Prius or clunky Honda Insight. Those cars only made drivers look cool because famous eco-friendly celebrities owned them.

So Tesla decided to make cars that made drivers look cool all by themselves. Even Leonardo DiCaprio stopped driving his Prius and got a fancy Tesla Roadster that looked expensive.

While other clean tech companies had a hard time standing out, Tesla built a special brand by knowing that clean technology was more about being popular and social than just helping the environment.
