eBay started by selling Beanie Babies and didn’t jump straight to selling sports cars or industrial stuff. It kept focusing on small hobby sellers until it became the most trusted place for people to buy and sell things online, no matter what the item was.

Sometimes growing bigger has hidden problems—eBay has learned this in recent years.

Like all marketplaces, eBay naturally became a monopoly because buyers go where sellers are, and sellers go where buyers are. But the auction style works best for unique items like coins and stamps. It doesn’t work as well for everyday things like pencils or tissues, because people prefer to buy those quickly from places like Amazon. eBay is still an important monopoly, but it’s not as big as people thought it would be in 2004.

Knowing when and how to grow is really important, and it takes patience to expand slowly. The most successful companies first become the best in one small area, then grow into nearby markets. This is a key part of their story.

Silicon Valley talks a lot about “disruption.” At first, disruption meant using new technology to create cheap products that get better over time and eventually beat older, expensive ones. This happened when PCs replaced mainframe computers: PCs seemed useless at first but then took over.

Now, mobile devices might be doing the same to PCs.

But lately, “disruption” has just become a cool word for anything new and trendy. This matters because it can make entrepreneurs think about themselves in a competitive way that isn’t always helpful. The idea of disruption was meant to describe threats to big companies, so startups focusing too much on it see themselves as fighting old companies. If you think of yourself only as fighting against others, you might get stuck on problems instead of creating something new. If your company is just about opposing others, it’s probably not truly new and won’t become a monopoly.

Disruption also gets attention: disruptive kids get in trouble, and disruptive companies often pick fights they can’t win. For example, Napster was a disruptive music-sharing site started by two teenagers in 1999. They got famous quickly but went bankrupt soon after because they fought the powerful music industry.

PayPal was kind of disruptive, but we didn’t directly fight any big company.

We took some business from Visa by making online payments popular, but since we made more people use payments overall, Visa actually ended up with more business.

This was a positive situation, unlike Napster’s fight with the music industry. When you plan to grow into new markets, try not to disrupt—try to avoid competition as much as you can.
