Professors often say that school isn’t super competitive, but business leaders love comparing business to war. MBA students even carry books by famous war thinkers like Clausewitz and Sun Tzu. We use war words all the time in business: we hire “headhunters,” try to “take over” markets, and want to “make a killing.” But actually, it’s competition, not business itself, that is like war—necessary, brave, but also destructive.

Why do people compete? Marx and Shakespeare give us two ways to understand fighting.

Marx says people fight because they are very different. For example, the workers (proletariat) fight the owners (bourgeoisie) because they want different things. The bigger the differences, the bigger the fight.

Shakespeare thinks the fighters are mostly the same. They don’t really have a good reason to fight. Look at Romeo and Juliet: “Two households, both alike in dignity.” They are similar, but they hate each other anyway.

As the fight goes on, they become even more alike and forget why they started fighting.

In business, Shakespeare’s idea fits better. Inside a company, people get obsessed with beating their coworkers to get ahead. Then companies get obsessed with beating their rivals. People forget what really matters and just focus on beating others.

Let’s try Shakespeare’s idea with a real example. Imagine a story called Gates and Schmidt, like Romeo and Juliet. Montague is Microsoft. Capulet is Google. Two big tech families, led by strong leaders, clashing because they are so similar.

The fight looks like it had to happen, but it didn’t. These two started in different places. Microsoft made operating systems and office tools. Google made a search engine. There wasn’t much reason to fight.

But as they grew, they started watching each other closely. Microsoft obsessed about Google, and Google obsessed about Microsoft. This led to fights like Windows vs. Chrome OS, Bing vs. Google Search, Explorer vs. Chrome, Office vs. Docs, and Surface vs. Nexus.

Like in Romeo and Juliet, the fight hurt both families. Microsoft and Google lost their top spots when Apple came along and beat them both. In 2013, Apple was worth $500 billion, more than Google and Microsoft combined. Just three years earlier, Microsoft and Google were each worth more than Apple. Fighting costs a lot.

When companies fight like this, they focus too much on old ideas and copy each other instead of creating new things. For example, after Square made a cool credit card reader for phones in 2010, lots of others copied it. A Canadian company made a half-moon shaped reader, Intuit made a cylinder, and PayPal made a triangle, kind of teasing Square’s square shape. It feels like this fight over shapes will go on forever.

This shows that competition can make people copy each other instead of coming up with fresh ideas.
