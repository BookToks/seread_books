Famous people are sometimes called “American royalty.” We even give special names to our favorite stars: Elvis Presley was the king of rock. Michael Jackson was the king of pop. Britney Spears was the pop princess.

But then things changed. Elvis ruined himself in the ’70s and died alone, overweight, sitting on his toilet. Now, people who dress like him don’t look cool anymore. Michael Jackson went from a beloved kid star to a strange, unhealthy person with drug problems; everyone was interested in his court cases. Britney’s story is the most intense. We made her a superstar as a teenager, but later she had big problems: shaving her head, eating too much or too little, and a public court fight to keep her kids. Was she always a bit crazy? Did the fame mess with her? Or did she do it to get attention?

Some stars become legends after they die. Many famous musicians died at age 27—like Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, and Kurt Cobain—and this is called the “27 Club.” Before she died in 2011, Amy Winehouse sang, “They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said, ‘No, no, no.’” Maybe she didn’t want rehab because she wanted to stay famous forever.
