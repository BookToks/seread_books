A great tech company should have technology that is way better than anything else out there. But clean energy companies usually don’t make products that are even twice as good, let alone ten times better.

Sometimes their products are actually worse than the ones they want to replace. For example, Solyndra made solar cells shaped like cylinders, but these cells only catch about one-third as much sunlight as flat ones. They tried to fix this by using mirrors to bounce more sunlight onto the panels, but it’s hard to make up for starting with a much worse design.

Companies need to aim for products that are ten times better because small improvements often don’t really help the customer. Imagine you create a new wind turbine that is 20% more efficient in lab tests. That sounds good, but in real life, the costs and risks make it hard for that small gain to matter. Also, people often don’t believe small claims, so you’ll have trouble convincing them to buy it. Only when your product is ten times better can you clearly show customers it’s the best choice.
