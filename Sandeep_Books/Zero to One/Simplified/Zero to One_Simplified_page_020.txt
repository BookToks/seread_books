Make small progress step by step. Big, unrealistic dreams caused the bubble to burst, so don’t get caught up in them. If someone says they can do something amazing, be careful, and if they want to change the world, they should be more humble. Taking small, steady steps is the safest way to move forward.

2. Stay simple and flexible. All companies need to be “lean,” which means not having a strict plan. You shouldn’t know exactly what your business will do because planning too much can make you stuck. Instead, try different things, learn from them, and treat starting a business like testing out ideas.

3. Make better versions of what’s already out there. Don’t try to create a new market too soon. The best way to know your business works is to start with customers who already exist. Build your company by improving products that successful competitors already offer.

4. Focus on making a good product, not on selling it. If your product needs ads or salespeople to sell, it’s not good enough. Technology is mostly about making great products, not about marketing. Ads during the bubble were a waste of money, so real growth comes from people sharing your product naturally.

These ideas have become rules in the startup world. People who ignore them are thought to fail like many did in the 2000 tech crash. But actually, the opposite ideas might be more true:

1. It’s better to take big risks than to play it safe.  
2. Having a bad plan is better than no plan at all.  
3. Competing in crowded markets ruins profits.  
4. Selling is just as important as making the product.

It’s true there was a tech bubble in the late ’90s. Back then, people were overconfident and believed in quickly making huge changes. Not many startups actually succeeded; many just talked about it. But people knew we had to find ways to do more with less.

The market peak in March 2000 was crazy, but it also showed people believed in a future where new technology would be very important, and they thought they could create it.

We still need new technology today, and maybe we need some of that bold confidence from 1999 to get it. To build the next big companies, we have to stop following the rules made after the crash.

That doesn’t mean the opposite ideas are always right. You can’t just reject popular opinions blindly. Instead, ask yourself how much of what you believe about business is just a reaction to past mistakes. The smartest thing is not to just go against the crowd, but to think for yourself.
