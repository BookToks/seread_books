Tesla’s success shows that clean technology isn’t a bad idea. The main point is true: the world really needs new ways to get energy. Energy is super important because it helps us grow food, build homes, and make everything we need to live well. Most people want to live as comfortably as Americans do, and as the world becomes more connected, energy problems will get worse unless we invent new technology. There aren’t enough resources to keep doing things the old way or just share what we have differently.

Clean technology made people hopeful about the future of energy. But when investors who were too optimistic gave money to green energy companies without clear plans, it created a bubble. If you look at the value of alternative energy companies in the 2000s and compare it to the internet boom and bust in the 1990s, they look very similar. In the 1990s, everyone thought the internet was going to be huge, but many companies only had that one idea and no clear plan. A business can’t succeed just because it’s part of a big trend; it has to have a clear, focused plan. Clean tech companies had the same problem: no matter how much energy is needed, only companies that solve a specific energy problem in a better way can make money. Just being in an important field isn’t enough to build a great company.

The internet bubble in the 90s was much bigger than the clean tech bubble, and its crash was worse. But the internet dream was right after all. People who doubted the internet’s impact in 2001 seemed smart then, but now that looks silly. Could new energy startups succeed after the clean tech crash just like new internet companies started after the dot-com bust? The need for energy solutions is still real. But a good business has to start by focusing on a small market and becoming the best there.

Facebook began by serving only one university before it grew to other schools and then the whole world. Finding small markets for energy solutions will be hard—you might try to replace diesel power on remote islands or build small nuclear reactors that can be quickly set up at military bases in dangerous areas. The challenge for the people who will build Energy 2.0 is to think small first.
