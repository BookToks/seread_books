What if the right way to measure isn’t just solar energy, but all renewable energy?

Every year, the world can produce 420 gigawatts of renewable energy. Your share is only 0.02% of that. Compared to the total power the world can make, which is 15,000 gigawatts, your 100 megawatts is really tiny.

Clean technology entrepreneurs didn’t understand the market well. They made their market seem smaller to stand out, but then asked to be valued like they had a huge market. You can’t be the best in a market that doesn’t really exist, and big markets have a lot of competitors, so they’re hard to win. Most clean tech founders would have done better opening a new British restaurant in downtown Palo Alto.
