THE WORLD ACCORDING TO CONVENTION

How would you see the world if you didn’t believe in secrets? You’d have to think we’ve already figured out all the big questions. If today’s common ideas are right, we can feel proud and relaxed: “Everything is fine in the world.” 

For example, a world without secrets would have perfect justice. Every unfair thing actually depends on a truth that most people don’t notice at first: in a democracy, a bad practice keeps going only when most people don’t think it’s unfair. At first, only a few people knew that slavery was wrong; later, many agreed, but back then it was still a “secret.” Saying there are no secrets now would mean we live in a world with no hidden unfairness.

In economics, not believing in secrets means trusting that markets always work well. But things like financial bubbles show markets can be really messed up. (The more people believe markets are perfect, the bigger the bubbles get.) In 1999, no one wanted to believe the internet was overpriced. The same happened with houses in 2005: the Fed leader Alan Greenspan said there were some “signs of froth” but denied a national bubble. People thought the market knew everything and couldn’t be wrong.

Then house prices dropped everywhere, causing the 2008 financial crisis that destroyed trillions of dollars. The future had many secrets economists couldn’t ignore.

What happens when a company stops believing in secrets? Hewlett-Packard’s sad fall is a warning. In 1990, HP was worth $9 billion. Then it spent ten years inventing cool stuff. In 1991, HP made the DeskJet 500C, the first cheap color printer. In 1993, it launched the OmniBook, one of the first light laptops. In 1994, HP made the OfficeJet, the first all-in-one printer, fax, and copier. Because of all this, by 2000 HP was worth $135 billion.

But in late 1999, when HP started a new campaign about “inventing,” it actually stopped inventing. In 2001, HP launched HP Services, mostly consulting and support. In 2002, HP merged with Compaq, probably because it didn’t have a better plan. By 2005, HP’s value had dropped to $70 billion—half of what it was five years before.

HP’s board showed the problem: it split into two groups, but only one cared about new technology. That group was led by Tom Perkins, an engineer who joined HP in 1963 to run research. In 2005, Perkins was 73 but still hopeful: he thought the board should find the best new tech and have HP build it. But Perkins’s group lost to the other one, led by chairwoman Patricia Dunn. Dunn was a banker and said the board wasn’t good at planning future tech. She thought the board should just watch over things like accounting and rules.

During this fight, someone on the board leaked info to the press. When it came out that Dunn used illegal wiretaps to find the leaker, the scandal was worse than the fight itself, and the board’s reputation was ruined. Giving up on discovering new tech secrets, HP started focusing on gossip. Because of this, by late 2012 HP was worth only $23 billion—not much more than it was worth back in 1990, even after adjusting for inflation.
