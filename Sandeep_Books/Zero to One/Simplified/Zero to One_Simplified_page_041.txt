2. Network Effects

Network effects mean a product becomes more useful as more people use it. For example, if all your friends are on Facebook, it makes sense for you to join Facebook too. Choosing a different social network alone would just make you look weird.

Network effects can be very strong, but you only get them if your product is useful to the very first users when there aren’t many people using it yet. For example, in 1960, a company called Xanadu tried to build a network connecting all computers, like an early version of the internet. They worked on it for over 30 years but failed because their system needed every computer to join at the same time, which never happened.

So, network effect businesses actually have to start with very small groups. Facebook started only with Harvard students — Mark Zuckerberg’s first goal was to get all his classmates to sign up, not everyone in the world. That’s why businesses based on network effects usually don’t start with big business people, because the first market is so small it doesn’t look like a big opportunity.

3. Economies of Scale

A monopoly business gets stronger as it grows bigger because the fixed costs of making a product (like paying engineers, managers, or rent) can be spread over more sales. Software companies have a big advantage because making extra copies of their product costs almost nothing.

Many businesses don’t get much stronger as they grow. Service businesses are especially hard to turn into monopolies. For example, if you own a yoga studio, you can only serve so many customers. You can hire more teachers or open more locations, but your profit won’t get very big, and you can’t serve millions of people like software engineers can.

A good startup should be designed to grow big from the start. Twitter already has over 250 million users and doesn’t need to add many special features to get more users. There’s no real reason why it can’t keep growing.

4. Branding

A company always owns its own brand, so building a strong brand is a powerful way to create a monopoly. Apple is the strongest tech brand today: their products like the iPhone and MacBook look great and use high-quality materials. Their Apple Stores are designed simply and nicely, and they control the shopping experience. They also have lots of ads, high prices, and the cool image from Steve Jobs that make people think Apple’s products are in a class by themselves.

Many companies have tried to copy Apple’s success by using ads, fancy stores, expensive materials, fun presentations, high prices, and simple designs, but it’s hard to match Apple exactly.
