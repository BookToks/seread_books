He can be called a natural business person: Branson started his first company when he was 16, and at just 22, he created Virgin Records. But some parts of his fame—like his wild lion’s mane hairstyle—aren’t natural. It seems like he wasn’t born with that exact look.

As Branson showed off his extreme traits (like kiteboarding with naked supermodels—was that a way to get attention or just him having fun? Maybe both), the media loved him. They gave him nicknames like “The Virgin King,” “The Undisputed King of PR,” “The King of Branding,” and “The King of the Desert and Space.” When Virgin Atlantic Airways started serving drinks with ice cubes shaped like Branson’s face, he became “The Ice King.”

Is Branson just a regular businessman who got famous because of good media help? Or is he actually a branding genius who knows how to control the media? It’s hard to say—maybe he is both.
