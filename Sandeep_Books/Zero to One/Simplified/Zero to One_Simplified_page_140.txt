THE RETURN OF THE KING

Just as Microsoft was losing its power because of legal problems, Steve Jobs came back to Apple and showed how important a company’s founder really is. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates were very different. Jobs was creative, liked closed systems, and focused on making amazing products. Gates was a businessman, kept his products open, and wanted to control the market. But both were insiders and outsiders at the same time, and both pushed their companies to reach goals no one else could.

Jobs dropped out of college, often walked around barefoot, and didn’t like to shower. He was also the center of his own personality cult. Sometimes he acted charming, sometimes crazy, maybe depending on his mood or plans. His strange habits, like eating only apples, might have been part of a bigger strategy. But this weird behavior caused problems in 1985 when Apple’s board pushed him out after he clashed with the company’s grown-up CEO.

When Jobs came back to Apple 12 years later, it showed that creating new value in business can’t just be done by following rules or by professionals. Before Jobs returned in 1997, Apple’s expert leaders had almost gone bankrupt. That year, Michael Dell said, “What would I do? I’d shut it down and give the money back to the owners.” But Jobs brought out the iPod in 2001, the iPhone in 2007, and the iPad in 2010 before he had to quit in 2011 because of health problems. By 2012, Apple was the most valuable company in the world.

Apple’s success really depended on the unique vision of one person. This shows that tech companies often act more like old kingdoms ruled by one leader than like modern businesses. A unique founder can make big decisions, inspire loyalty, and plan for many years. On the other hand, big companies run by many professionals last longer but usually think only about the short term.
