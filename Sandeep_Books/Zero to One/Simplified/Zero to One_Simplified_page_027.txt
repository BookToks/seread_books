RUTHLESS PEOPLE

The problem with a business where lots of companies compete is more than just not making enough money. Imagine you run a restaurant in Mountain View. You’re not very different from many other restaurants nearby, so you have to work really hard to stay open.

If you sell cheap food and don’t make much profit, you can only pay your workers the minimum wage. You also have to find ways to save money, like having Grandma work at the cash register or making the kids wash dishes in the back.

Even the best restaurants aren’t much better. Top chefs face huge pressure because of tough ratings, like Michelin stars, which can make them really stressed. For example, Bernard Loiseau, a famous French chef with three Michelin stars, said, “If I lose a star, I will commit suicide.” Even though Michelin kept his rating, he still took his own life in 2003 after another guide lowered his restaurant’s score. This kind of competition can make people act cruelly or feel hopeless.

A monopoly, like Google, is different. Since it doesn’t have to worry about other companies beating it, it can spend more time caring about its workers, products, and the world.

Google’s motto, “Don’t be evil,” is partly to look good, but it also shows that successful businesses can care about doing the right thing without risking their survival. In business, making money is either very important or the only thing that matters. Companies with a monopoly can think about more than just money. But businesses that face a lot of competition usually focus only on making money today, not planning for the future. The only way a business can stop fighting just to survive every day is by making monopoly profits.
