STARTUP THINKING

New technology usually comes from new businesses called startups. From important groups like the Founding Fathers in politics, the Royal Society in science, to Fairchild Semiconductor’s “traitorous eight” in business, small teams with a clear goal have changed the world for the better.

The simple reason is that it’s hard to create new things in big companies, and it’s even harder to do it alone. Big companies are slow and don’t like to take risks. Sometimes, people in bad companies focus more on pretending to work than actually working (if this is true for your company, you should leave now). On the other hand, a single genius might make a great piece of art or writing, but they can’t build a whole industry. Startups work because people team up, but stay small enough to get things done.

A startup is the biggest group of people you can convince to help build a different future. The best thing about a new company is new ideas. Being small gives you room to think. This book is about the questions you need to ask and answer to succeed in making new things. It’s not a guide or a list of facts, but a way to think. Because a startup has to question old ideas and rethink business from the beginning.
