This business question is trickier than it seems because your company can create a lot of value but still not be very valuable itself. Making value isn’t enough—you also have to keep some of the value you create.

This means even huge businesses can be bad businesses. For example, U.S. airlines serve millions of passengers and create hundreds of billions of dollars in value each year.

But in 2012, when the average ticket cost $178, airlines only made 37 cents per passenger trip. Compare that to Google, which made less value but kept way more of it. Google made $50 billion in 2012 (compared to $160 billion for airlines) and kept 21% of that as profit—more than 100 times the airlines’ profit margin. Google makes so much money, it’s now worth three times more than all U.S. airlines combined.

The airlines compete with each other, but Google doesn’t have real competition. Economists use two simple ideas to explain this: perfect competition and monopoly.

“Perfect competition” is what you learn first in Economics 101. In these markets, supply meets demand perfectly. Every company sells the same product and has no power to change prices. If a company makes money, new ones join, increase supply, lower prices, and wipe out profits. If too many join, some lose money and leave, so prices go back up.

In perfect competition, no company makes long-term profits.

The opposite of perfect competition is monopoly. A monopoly owns its market and can set prices however it wants. Since it has no competition, it picks the amount and price that earns the most profit.

To economists, all monopolies look the same, whether they got there by unfair means or by being really good. Here, monopoly means a company so good that no one else can offer something close. Google is a great example—it hasn’t had real competition in search since the early 2000s, when it left Microsoft and Yahoo far behind.

Americans love the idea of competition and think it’s what saves us from bad systems.

But actually, capitalism and competition are opposites. Capitalism is about building wealth, but in perfect competition, all profits disappear. So the lesson for entrepreneurs is clear: if you want to create and keep lasting value, don’t build a business that’s just like everyone else’s.
