Out of the six people, five were only 23 years old or younger. Four of us were born outside the United States. Three had come here from communist countries: Yu Pan from China, Luke Nosek from Poland, and Max Levchin from Soviet Ukraine. Making bombs wasn’t something kids usually did in those places back then.

The six of us might have seemed a little strange. My first talk with Luke was about how he signed up for cryonics, which means being frozen after death in hope of coming back to life someday. Max said he didn’t belong to any country and was proud of it because his family got stuck in a weird situation when the USSR broke up while they were moving to the U.S. Russ Simmons had left a trailer park to go to a top math and science school in Illinois. Only Ken Howery had a more typical American childhood—he was PayPal’s only Eagle Scout. But even Ken’s friends thought he was crazy for joining us and taking only a third of the salary he could have gotten at a big bank. So, none of us were really normal.

The PayPal Team in 1999 Were all founders weird in some way? Or do we just remember and make a big deal about whatever made them different? More importantly, what personal qualities really matter in a founder? This chapter talks about why having a unique person lead a company can be super powerful but also risky, instead of having a regular manager who could be replaced.
