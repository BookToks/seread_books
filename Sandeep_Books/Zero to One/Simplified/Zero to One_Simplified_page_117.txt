THE MONOPOLY QUESTION

In 2006, billionaire tech investor John Doerr said, “green is the new red, white and blue.” He could have just said “red.” As Doerr explained, internet markets are worth billions of dollars, but energy markets are worth trillions. What he didn’t say is that huge markets like these mean super tough competition. Many others agreed with Doerr back then. During the 2000s, I heard lots of clean energy business owners start their presentations by talking about these huge trillion-dollar markets—as if that was a good thing.

Clean energy leaders talked about how big the energy market was, saying there was room for everyone. But each one usually believed their own company had an advantage. In 2006, Dave Pearce, CEO of a solar company called MiaSolé, told Congress that his company was one of several strong startups working on a special kind of solar panel. Right after, Pearce said MiaSolé would be the biggest producer of this kind of solar panel within a year. That didn’t happen, and it probably wouldn’t have helped much anyway. That type of solar panel is just one of many kinds. Customers only care about the technology if it solves a problem better than others. If you can’t own a unique solution in a small market, you’ll face harsh competition. That’s what happened to MiaSolé. They were sold in 2013 for much less than their investors put in.

Thinking your company is super unique is an easy way to mess up the monopoly question. Imagine you run a solar company that installed panels with a total power of 100 megawatts. Since the total U.S. solar power is 950 megawatts, you own about 10.5% of the market. Congrats, you might say—you’re a big deal.

But what if the U.S. market isn’t the real market? What if the real market is the whole world’s solar market, which produces 18 gigawatts? Now your 100 megawatts is tiny—you own less than 1% of the market.
