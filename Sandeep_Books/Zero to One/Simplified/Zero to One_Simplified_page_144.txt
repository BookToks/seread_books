Which of the four will it be?

A repeated collapse seems unlikely because today, knowledge is everywhere. If everything was completely destroyed, that would be more likely than a long dark period followed by recovery. But if humans go extinct, there is no future for us at all.

If we think of the future as a time that looks different from now, most people don’t really expect that. They think the next decades will bring more globalization, making countries more alike. Poorer countries will catch up to richer ones, and the world’s economy will level off. But even if this global balance happens, can it last? At best, competition for money and success will be tougher than ever for everyone.

When you add fighting over limited resources, it’s hard to see how this balance could last forever. Without new technology to ease the pressure, this standstill could lead to conflict. If conflicts happen worldwide, this balance breaks down and could even cause extinction.

That leaves the fourth option: creating new technology to build a much better future.

The most extreme idea is called the Singularity. It means new technology will grow so powerful, it goes beyond what we understand now. Ray Kurzweil, a famous thinker about this, uses Moore’s law and growth in many areas to predict superhuman artificial intelligence.

Kurzweil says, “the Singularity is near,” and it’s going to happen. He thinks all we need to do is get ready to accept it.

But no matter the trends, the future won’t just happen on its own. What the Singularity looks like is less important than the big choice we face now: do nothing or do something. It’s up to us. We can’t assume the future will be better, so we have to work to create it today.

Whether we reach the Singularity on a huge scale might be less important than whether we take the chances we have now to do new things in our own lives. Everything important—the universe, the planet, the country, your company, your life, and this moment—is unique.

Our job today is to find unique ways to create new things that make the future not just different, but better—to go from zero to one. The first step is to think for yourself. Only by seeing the world in a new way, as fresh and strange as it was to the first people who saw it, can we recreate and protect it for the future.
