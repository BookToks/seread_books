BUILDING A MONOPOLY

A monopoly happens when a company becomes the biggest in its market by using things like a strong brand, a big size, a helpful network, and good technology. But to make this work, you have to pick your market carefully and grow step by step.

Start Small and Monopolize

Every new company starts small. Every monopoly controls a big part of its market. So, new companies should begin with a very small market. It’s better to start too small than too big.

This is because it’s easier to be the best in a small market than in a big one. If you think your market is too big at first, it probably is.

Small doesn’t mean unimportant. We made this mistake at PayPal. Our first product let people send money using PalmPilots. It was cool technology, but not many people needed it. PalmPilot users were spread out and didn’t use their devices much. So, we had no customers.

After learning this, we focused on eBay auctions. That’s where we found success. In 1999, eBay had a few thousand “PowerSellers” who sold a lot. After three months, we helped 25% of them. It was easier to reach a few thousand people who really needed our product than to try to attract millions of random users.

The best market for a startup is a small group of people who are close together and don’t have many competitors. Big markets are not good, and big markets with lots of competitors are even worse. That’s why it’s a bad sign when people say they want 1% of a $100 billion market. Big markets usually don’t have a good starting point, and competition is tough. Even if you get a small part, you might just break even because of the competition.

Scaling Up

Once you fully control a small market, you can slowly grow into nearby and bigger markets. Amazon shows how to do this. Jeff Bezos wanted to own all online shopping, but he started with just books. Books were easy to handle and ship, and some rare books attracted excited customers. Amazon became the best place for people far from bookstores or looking for unusual books.

After that, Amazon had two choices: find more book readers or move into related markets. They chose the second option and added CDs, videos, and software. They kept adding new types of products until they became a huge online store. The name “Amazon” fits their plan perfectly. The Amazon rainforest has many different kinds of plants and animals, just like Amazon wanted to offer every kind of product.

eBay also started small. When it began in 1995, it didn’t need everyone to use it right away. It worked well for groups with strong interests, like people who collected Beanie Babies.
