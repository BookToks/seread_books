Today, over 1.5 billion people can quickly find information using small devices they carry everywhere. Every smartphone now is way more powerful than the computers that helped astronauts go to the moon. And if technology keeps improving like it has, future computers will be even stronger.

Computers are already better than humans at some things we used to think only people could do. In 1997, IBM’s Deep Blue beat the world chess champion, Garry Kasparov.

In 2011, IBM’s Watson beat the best Jeopardy! player, Ken Jennings. Google’s self-driving cars are already driving on California streets. Dale Earnhardt Jr. doesn’t need to worry about them, but many taxi drivers are scared because self-driving cars might cause a lot of people to lose their jobs. People expect computers to do even more soon, so much that some wonder if humans will have any jobs left in 30 years. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen said “software is eating the world,” meaning computers are taking over many tasks. Another expert, Andy Kessler, said the best way to be more productive is “to get rid of people.” Forbes even asked readers if a machine will replace their jobs.

Some futurists seem to want machines to take over. Others, called Luddites, are so scared of losing their jobs that they want to stop new technology from being made. But both groups are wrong to assume that better computers will always replace people. Instead, computers help humans do better work, not take their place. The most successful businesses in the future will be started by people who want to help others, not replace them.
