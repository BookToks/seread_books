WHY PEOPLE DON’T SEE THE POWER LAW

Why would professional venture capitalists (VCs), who are experts, fail to notice the power law? One reason is that it only becomes obvious over time, but even tech investors often focus too much on the present.

Imagine a firm invests in 10 companies that could become huge and dominate their markets. This is already a very careful way to choose companies.

At first, these companies will all look pretty similar before they start growing really fast.

Over the next few years, some companies will fail, and others will start doing well. Their values will change, but it won’t be clear yet who is growing exponentially or just a little bit.
