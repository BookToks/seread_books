WHY PEOPLE DON’T SEE THE POWER LAW Why would professional VCs, of all people, fail to see the power law? For one thing, it only becomes clear over time, and even technology investors too often live in the present.

 Those companies will look very similar in the early stages before exponential growth.
 
 Over the next few years, some companies will fail while others begin to succeed; valuations will diverge, but the difference between exponential growth and linear growth will be unclear.
