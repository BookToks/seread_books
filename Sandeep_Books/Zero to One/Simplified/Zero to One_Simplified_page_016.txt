The euro started in January 1999, but many people didn’t believe in it or care about it. It went up to $1.19 on its first day, but dropped to $0.83 within two years. In the middle of 2000, big banks from the G7 countries had to spend billions of dollars to help keep it going.

At the same time, the dot-com craze began in September 1998. This happened because nothing else seemed to be working. The Old Economy, which means traditional businesses, couldn’t handle the problems caused by globalization. People needed something to work—and work really well—if the future was going to be better.

Because of this, the New Economy, which was all about the internet, seemed like the only way forward.
