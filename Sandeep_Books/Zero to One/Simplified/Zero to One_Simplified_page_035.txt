Then Informix CEO Phil White decided to make things personal. When White found out that Larry Ellison liked Japanese samurai culture, he made a new billboard showing the Oracle logo with a broken samurai sword. The ad wasn’t really meant for Oracle as a company or the public; it was a personal attack on Ellison. But maybe White spent too much time worrying about the competition. While he was busy making billboards, Informix fell apart because of a big accounting scandal, and White ended up in federal prison for securities fraud.

If you can’t beat a rival, it might be better to join forces. I started Confinity with my co-founder Max Levchin in 1998. When we launched PayPal in late 1999, Elon Musk’s company X.com was right behind us. Our offices were just four blocks apart on University Avenue in Palo Alto, and X.com’s product copied ours feature for feature. By late 1999, we were in a full-on war. Many of us at PayPal worked 100 hours a week. That probably wasn’t the best for productivity, but we weren’t focused on that; we just wanted to beat X.com. One of our engineers even designed a bomb to use against them. When he showed the plan at a team meeting, cooler heads stopped him and said he was just sleep-deprived.

But in February 2000, Elon and I were more worried about the tech bubble bursting than about each other. A financial crash would destroy us both before we could finish fighting. So in early March, we met at a café halfway between our offices and agreed to merge 50-50. It wasn’t easy to calm down the rivalry after merging, but it was a good problem to have. Together, we survived the dot-com crash and built a successful business.

Sometimes you do have to fight. When that happens, you should fight hard and win. There’s no middle ground: either don’t fight at all or strike hard to end it quickly.

This advice is hard because pride and honor can get in the way. That’s why Hamlet said: Exposing what is mortal and unsure To all that fortune, death, and danger dare, Even for an eggshell. To be truly great isn’t to fight without a good reason, but to get upset and fight even over something as small as an eggshell when your honor is at stake.

For Hamlet, being great means being ready to fight even for tiny reasons. Anyone fights for important things; true heroes care about their honor so much they’ll fight over things that don’t really matter. This weird way of thinking is part of being human, but it’s bad for business. If you can see competition as something that destroys rather than adds value, you’re already smarter than most people. The next chapter will show how to use a clear mind to build a monopoly business.
