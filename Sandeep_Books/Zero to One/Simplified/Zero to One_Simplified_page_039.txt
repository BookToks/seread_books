Thinking about future profits is really important, even if it doesn’t seem obvious, even in places like Silicon Valley. For a company to be worth something, it needs to keep growing and last a long time. But many business owners only care about quick growth. They have a reason for this: it’s easy to measure growth, but hard to measure if the business will last.

People who focus too much on numbers get obsessed with things like how many users they have every week, how much money they make each month, and quarterly reports. But you can meet those goals and still miss bigger problems that could make your business fail in the long run.

For example, Zynga and Groupon grew really fast, but that made managers and investors ignore bigger challenges. Zynga had hits like Farmville and said they had a way to predict if new games would be popular. But they faced the same problem as movie studios: it’s hard to keep making popular stuff for an audience that changes all the time. Groupon grew quickly because lots of local businesses tried their service, but getting those businesses to keep using it was much tougher than expected.

If you only focus on quick growth, you won’t ask the most important question: will this business still exist in ten years? Numbers won’t give you the answer. Instead, you have to think carefully about what makes your business strong in ways you can’t easily measure.
