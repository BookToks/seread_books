MONEY ISN’T EVERYTHING

For people to really care about their work, they need to be paid fairly. When someone wants me to invest in their company, I always ask how much they plan to pay themselves. Usually, the less the CEO pays themselves, the better the company does—that’s something I’ve seen over and over after investing in many startups. A CEO of a new startup should never make more than $150,000 a year. It doesn’t matter if they used to earn way more at a big company or have expensive bills to pay. If a CEO makes $300,000 a year, they might start acting like a politician instead of a founder. When they get paid a lot, they want to keep things the same to protect their salary, instead of working hard with the team to find and fix problems. But a CEO who doesn’t get much money will focus on making the whole company better.

Paying the CEO less also shows everyone else what to expect. Aaron Levie, the CEO of Box, always paid himself less than anyone else. Four years after starting the company, he still lived in a small apartment nearby with hardly any furniture. Everyone at the company saw how dedicated he was and followed his example.

If a CEO doesn’t take the lowest salary, they can still set a good example by taking the highest salary, as long as it’s not too high. This way, there’s a clear limit on how much anyone gets paid in cash.

Money is tempting because once you get paid, you can spend it however you want. But when people get paid a lot of money, they tend to focus on taking what the company already has instead of working to build more value later. A cash bonus is a bit better because it depends on doing a good job, but even bonuses make people think short-term and try to grab value now. Any kind of cash payment is more about the present than the future.
