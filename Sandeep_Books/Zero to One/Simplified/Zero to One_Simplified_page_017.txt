The dot-com mania lasted for a short but crazy 18 months from September 1998 to March 2000. It was like a gold rush in Silicon Valley: money was everywhere, and lots of excited, sometimes shady people wanted a piece of it. Every week, many new startups threw huge launch parties. (But actual big deals were rare.) People who made paper millions would order expensive dinners and try to pay with shares of their startup’s stock—sometimes it even worked.

Many people left their good jobs to start or join startups. I knew a grad student in his 40s who was running six different companies in 1999. (Usually, being a 40-year-old grad student is seen as weird. Starting six companies at once is seen as crazy. But in the late ’90s, people thought this could work.) Everyone should have known the mania couldn’t last; the most “successful” companies even lost money as they grew. But it’s hard to blame people for having fun while it lasted; it made sense to act crazy when just adding “.com” to your name could double your value overnight.
