It starts with asking yourself: what will the world look like 10 or 20 years from now, and how will my business fit in?

Few cleantech companies had a good answer. Because of that, their stories all ended the same way.

A few months before it went bankrupt in 2011, Evergreen Solar said it had to close one of its U.S. factories. They explained that solar companies in China got a lot of help from their government and money support. Even though Evergreen’s costs were lower than planned and lower than most Western makers, their costs were still higher than the cheap Chinese competitors.

But it wasn’t until 2012 that blaming China really blew up. When Abound Solar, backed by the U.S. Department of Energy, went bankrupt, it blamed “aggressive pricing” from Chinese solar companies that made it hard for a new company to grow. When Energy Conversion Devices failed in 2012, it didn’t just blame China; it sued three big Chinese solar makers for things like trying to control the market and unfair pricing. Solyndra also sued those companies later that year. But was competition from China really a surprise? Cleantech entrepreneurs should have asked: what could stop China from destroying my business? Without an answer, their failure shouldn’t have shocked anyone.

Besides not predicting competition from China, cleantech also made wrong guesses about the energy market. The industry thought fossil fuels were going away, but it didn’t see fracking coming. In 2000, only 1.7% of America’s natural gas came from fracked shale. Five years later, it was 4.1%.

Still, no one in cleantech took this seriously. They believed renewables were the only future and fossil fuels wouldn’t get cheaper or cleaner. But they did. By 2013, shale gas made up 34% of America’s natural gas, and gas prices dropped more than 70% since 2008. This hurt most renewable energy businesses badly. Fracking might not last forever, but it was enough to crush cleantech companies that didn’t see it coming.
