Besides helping catch terrorists, people using Palantir’s software have been able to guess where bad guys put bombs in Afghanistan, solve big insider trading crimes, stop the world’s largest child pornography ring, help the CDC fight food poisoning outbreaks, and save banks and the government hundreds of millions of dollars each year by catching fraud.

The software was important, but even more important were the people like analysts, lawyers, scientists, and financial experts. Without their hard work, the software wouldn’t have done anything.

Think about what professionals do in their jobs now. Lawyers have to explain solutions in many ways depending on who they’re talking to, like a client or a judge. Doctors need to understand medicine and also explain it simply to patients. Good teachers don’t just know their subjects—they also know how to teach different students in ways that work best for them. Computers can do some of these things, but they can’t do all of them together.

Better technology in law, medicine, and education won’t replace professionals; it will help them do even more.

LinkedIn did this for recruiters. When LinkedIn started in 2003, they didn’t ask recruiters what parts of their jobs were the hardest. They also didn’t try to make software that would replace recruiters completely. Recruiting is part detective work and part sales—you have to check people’s backgrounds, figure out if they’ll fit, and convince the best ones to join. A computer can’t do all that. Instead, LinkedIn changed how recruiters work. Now, over 97% of recruiters use LinkedIn’s powerful search tools to find job candidates, and millions of professionals use it to build their personal brands. If LinkedIn had tried to replace recruiters with technology, it wouldn’t be successful today.

Why do so many people miss how well computers and humans can work together? It starts in school. Software engineers often work on projects that replace human jobs because that’s what they learn to do.

Researchers build their careers by focusing on very specific topics, and they want to publish papers about them. For computer scientists, this means breaking down what humans do into small tasks that computers can learn one by one.

Look at popular areas in computer science now. The phrase “machine learning” makes it sound like computers can replace humans, and many people believe that computers can learn almost any task if given enough data. If you use Netflix or Amazon, you’ve seen machine learning: the sites suggest movies or products based on what you’ve watched or bought before. The more data they get, the better the suggestions. Google Translate works the same way, giving rough but useful translations in 80 languages—not because it understands language, but because it found patterns in a huge amount of text.
