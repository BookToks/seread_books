MONOPOLY CAPITALISM  
So, a monopoly is good for the people running it, but what about everyone else? Do big profits come from taking money away from society? Actually, yes: profits come from customers’ wallets, and monopolies have a bad reputation—but only if nothing changes.

In a world that doesn’t change, a monopolist just collects money without giving anything new. If you control all of something, you can raise the price, and people have to buy from you. Think about the board game Monopoly: the properties don’t change, and you can only win by buying them all. The value of each property stays the same forever, so all you can do is try to get them.

But our world is always changing: new and better things can be invented. Creative monopolists give people more choices by making brand-new kinds of products. These kinds of monopolies are not just good for society; they help make the world better.

Even the government knows this: one part of it creates monopolies by giving patents to inventors, while another part tries to stop bad monopolies by enforcing antitrust laws. Some people wonder if anyone should get a monopoly just for thinking of something first, like a mobile app design. But it’s clear that Apple’s monopoly profits from the iPhone came because they made something people really wanted, not because they limited supply. Customers were happy to pay more for a smartphone that actually worked well.

New monopolies explain why old monopolies don’t stop new ideas.

With Apple’s iOS leading the way, mobile computing has cut down Microsoft’s long control over operating systems. Before that, Microsoft’s software beat IBM’s hardware monopoly. AT&T had a monopoly on phones for most of the 20th century, but now lots of companies offer cheap cell phone plans. If monopolies really held back progress, they’d be dangerous and we should fight them. But history shows that better monopolies replace old ones and help us move forward.

Monopolies push progress because having years of big profits makes companies want to invent new things. They can keep improving because their profits let them plan ahead and pay for big research projects that companies fighting for customers can’t afford.

So why do economists care so much about competition? It’s because of history.

Economists based their ideas on 19th-century physics: they think of people and businesses like tiny atoms that are all the same, instead of unique creators. Their theories focus on perfect competition because it’s easier to study, not because it’s the best way for business. But think about this: in physics, perfect balance means everything stops moving and dies—called the heat death of the universe. This is a good metaphor: in business, perfect balance means nothing changes, and that means death. If your industry is stuck in perfect competition, it doesn’t matter if your business dies; another similar one will always take over.
