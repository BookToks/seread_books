Hiring the right people is super important for any company. You should do it yourself, not let someone else handle it. You need people who aren’t just good on paper but who will actually work well together once they join. The first few hires might come because of big shares in the company or cool job roles. But the real question is: why would the 20th person want to join your company?

Talented people don’t have to work for you; they have lots of choices. You should ask yourself: why would someone join your company as the 20th engineer when they could get more money and fame working at Google?

Here are some bad reasons: “Your stock will be worth more here,” “You’ll work with the smartest people,” or “You can help solve big problems.” What’s wrong with these?

Nothing is wrong with stock, smart people, or big problems. But every company says the same things, so it doesn’t make you special. Generic reasons don’t explain why someone should pick your company over others.

Good reasons are specific to your company, so you won’t find them in this book. But there are two main types: reasons about your mission and reasons about your team. You’ll attract the right people if you can explain why your mission is exciting—not just why it’s important, but why you’re doing something no one else will. That’s what makes it special. For example, at PayPal, if you liked the idea of making a new digital currency to replace the U.S. dollar, they wanted to talk to you. If not, you weren’t the right fit.

Still, even a great mission isn’t enough. The kind of person you want will also ask, “Do I want to work with these people?” You need to explain why your team is a good match for them. If you can’t, they probably aren’t the right fit.

Most of all, don’t try to win by offering cool perks. Anyone who cares more about free laundry or pet daycare isn’t the right person for your team. Just cover basics like health insurance, and promise what no one else can: the chance to do important, unique work with great people. You might not pay like Google in 2014, but you can be like Google in 1999 if you have good reasons about your mission and team.
