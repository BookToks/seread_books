Employees should really like their jobs. They should enjoy going to work so much that they don’t care about strict office hours or watching the clock. The workspace should be open, not full of small cubicles, and workers should feel comfortable, like they’re at home. There might be beanbag chairs and Ping-Pong tables instead of lots of file cabinets. Free massages, sushi chefs at work, and yoga classes would make things even better. Pets should be allowed too, so dogs, cats, and even tropical fish could be part of the office fun.

But what’s wrong with this idea? It talks about some crazy perks popular in Silicon Valley, but it misses what really matters—and without that, perks don’t help. You can’t do something important just by decorating the office, hiring someone to fix policies, or using fancy words to make the company sound cool. “Company culture” isn’t separate from the company itself: every company is its culture. A startup is a group of people working toward a goal, and a good culture is how that team acts and feels inside.
