The first team I built is known in Silicon Valley as the “PayPal Mafia” because many of my old coworkers went on to help each other start and invest in successful tech companies. We sold PayPal to eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002. Since then, Elon Musk started SpaceX and helped start Tesla Motors; Reid Hoffman helped start LinkedIn; Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim started YouTube; Jeremy Stoppelman and Russel Simmons started Yelp; David Sacks helped start Yammer; and I helped start Palantir. Today, all seven of these companies are worth more than $1 billion each. PayPal’s office perks didn’t get much attention, but our team did really well, both together and on their own. The team spirit was strong enough to last even after PayPal.

We didn’t create the mafia by just looking at résumés and hiring the most talented people.

I saw how that didn’t always work when I worked at a law firm in New York. The lawyers were smart and ran a good business, but they didn’t have strong relationships. They spent all day together but didn’t talk much outside work. Why work with people you don’t even like? Many think that’s just how it is if you want to make money. But treating work like just a place to do tasks and move on is worse than cold—it doesn’t even make sense. Since your time is super valuable, it’s strange to spend it with people you don’t see having a future with. If you don’t build lasting friendships at work, you haven’t used your time well, even if you make money.

From the start, I wanted PayPal to be close-knit, not just a place where people come and go. I thought strong friendships would make us happier, better at work, and more successful even after PayPal. So we hired people who would actually enjoy working together. They had to be talented but, more than that, they had to be excited to work with us. That’s how the PayPal Mafia began.
