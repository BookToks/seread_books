I say this a lot, so my friends jokingly call it “Thiel’s law”: if a startup is messed up from the very beginning, it can’t be fixed later.

Starting something new is really important. It’s completely different from everything that happens after. This was true 13.8 billion years ago when the universe began: in the first tiny moments, it grew insanely fast—like a million trillion trillion times! Back then, the laws of physics were not the same as they are now.

It was also true 227 years ago when our country was founded. The people creating the Constitution had big questions to answer during the few months they worked together.

How much power should the central government have? How should Congress be set up? No matter what you think about the compromises they made that summer in Philadelphia, it’s been really hard to change those decisions since then. After the Bill of Rights was added in 1791, the Constitution has only been changed 17 times. Today, California has the same number of Senators as Alaska, even though California has over 50 times more people. Maybe that’s a good thing, maybe not. But it’s probably going to stay that way as long as the U.S. exists. Another big meeting to change the Constitution is unlikely; now we just argue about smaller things.

Companies are like countries in this way. If you make bad choices early on—like picking the wrong partners or hiring the wrong people—it’s really hard to fix later. Usually, it takes a big problem, like going bankrupt, before anyone tries to fix those mistakes. If you start a company, your first job is to get the basics right, because you can’t build a great company on a weak foundation.
