FOUNDING MATRIMONY When you start something new, the most important choice is who you start it with.

Picking a co-founder is like getting married, and fights between founders can be as bad as a divorce.

At the beginning of every relationship, people feel hopeful. It’s not cool to think about what might go wrong, so they don’t. But if founders can’t get along, the company suffers.

In 1999, Luke Nosek was one of my co-founders at PayPal, and I still work with him today at Founders Fund. But a year before PayPal, I invested in a company Luke started with someone else. It was his first startup, and one of my first investments. We didn’t know it then, but the company was doomed because Luke and his co-founder didn’t work well together. Luke is a smart and creative thinker; his co-founder was a business type who just wanted to join the ’90s rush. They met at a networking event, talked a bit, and decided to start a company together. That’s like marrying the first person you meet at a Vegas casino: you might get lucky, but it probably won’t work. Their company failed, and I lost my money.

Now, when I think about investing in a startup, I look closely at the founding team. Skills and experience are important, but how well the founders know each other and work together matters just as much. Founders should have a history together before starting a company — if not, they’re just taking a big risk.
