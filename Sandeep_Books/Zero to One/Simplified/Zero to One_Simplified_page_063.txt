Venture capitalists (VCs) try to find and invest money in new companies that might become really successful. They collect money from rich people and big organizations, put it into a fund, and invest in tech companies they think will grow a lot. If they’re right, they get about 20% of the profits.

A venture fund makes money when the companies they invest in become more valuable and either sell shares to the public or get bought by bigger companies. These funds usually last about 10 years because it takes time for companies to grow and become successful. But most new companies don’t succeed; many fail soon after they start. Because of this, venture funds often lose money at first. VCs hope the fund’s value will grow a lot after a few years when the successful companies start growing fast.

The big question is when this growth will happen. For most funds, it never does. Most startups fail, and so do most funds. Every VC knows they need to find the companies that will succeed, but even experienced investors don’t fully understand how rare those winners really are.

They realize companies are different, but they don’t realize just how different.

The mistake is thinking that returns from investments will be normal: some companies fail, some stay the same, and some do okay, maybe doubling or quadrupling in value. Thinking this way, investors spread their money across many companies and hope the winners will make up for the losers.

But this “spray and pray” method usually means the whole group of companies fails, with no big winners.

That’s because venture returns don’t follow a normal pattern. Instead, they follow a power law: only a tiny few companies do way better than all the rest. If you focus on spreading money around instead of chasing the few companies that can become huge, you’ll miss those rare winners in the first place.
