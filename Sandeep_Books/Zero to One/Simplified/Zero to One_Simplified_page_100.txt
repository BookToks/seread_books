Marketing and advertising work best for products that are pretty cheap and appeal to lots of people but don’t spread on their own. For example, Procter & Gamble can’t pay salespeople to go door-to-door selling laundry detergent. Instead, they hire people to talk to big stores because selling to one store can mean thousands of detergent bottles sold. To reach regular customers, companies make TV commercials, print coupons in newspapers, and design eye-catching packaging.

Advertising can help new companies too, but only when it costs less to get customers this way than any other method. Take Warby Parker, an online company that sells stylish prescription glasses. Each pair costs around $100, and customers usually buy a few pairs over time, so the company makes a few hundred dollars per customer.

That amount isn’t enough to give personal attention to every buyer, but glasses don’t usually go viral either. By making ads and funny TV commercials, Warby Parker can show its cool, cheaper glasses to millions of people who wear glasses. The company says on its website that “TV is a great big megaphone,” and when you have just a little money to get new customers, you need the biggest megaphone you can find.

Every new business wants a famous ad campaign, but startups shouldn’t try to compete with big companies by making the most memorable TV ads or crazy publicity stunts. I learned this myself. At PayPal, we hired James Doohan, who played Scotty on Star Trek, to be our spokesperson. When we launched our first software for the PalmPilot, we invited journalists to hear Scotty say, “I’ve been beaming people up my whole career, but this is the first time I’ve ever been able to beam money!” It didn’t work—the few journalists who came weren’t impressed. We thought Scotty, the engineer, would sound smarter than Captain Kirk, who was always showing off and getting into trouble. We were wrong. When Priceline.com hired William Shatner, who played Kirk, for their ads, it worked great. But by then, Priceline was already a big company. No small startup can afford ads like big companies. Captain Kirk is in a league of his own.

A product is viral if it makes people want to invite their friends to use it too.

This is how Facebook and PayPal grew fast: every time someone shares with a friend or sends money, they bring more people into the network. This way is not only cheap but also fast. If each new user brings in more than one new person, growth happens super quickly. The best viral loop is quick and easy to use.

Funny YouTube videos or memes get millions of views fast because people see something like a cute kitten, feel happy, and share it with friends right away.
