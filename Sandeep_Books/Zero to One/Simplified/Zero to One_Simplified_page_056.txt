Researchers try out ideas that might work instead of focusing on exact theories about how the body works.

Biologists say they have to do this because biology is really hard. They explain that IT startups work well because we built computers ourselves and designed them to follow our commands. Biotech is harder because we didn’t make our bodies, and the more we learn, the more complicated they seem.

But now, some people wonder if biology’s real difficulty is just an excuse for biotech startups not having a clear plan. Most people involved hope something will work eventually, but few want to fully commit to one company to make it succeed. This starts with professors who often work as part-time helpers instead of full-time staff—even in startups based on their own research.

Then everyone else copies the professors’ unsure attitude. Some say strict rules hold biotech back—and they do—but being too hopeful without a clear plan might be an even bigger problem for biotech’s future.
