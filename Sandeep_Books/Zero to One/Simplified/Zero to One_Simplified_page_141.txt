The lesson for business is that we need founders. Actually, we should be even more accepting of founders who seem weird or extreme because unusual people are needed to lead companies beyond small, safe changes.

The lesson for founders is that being famous and admired can quickly turn into being hated and criticized, so be careful.

Most importantly, don’t think you are super powerful alone. Founders matter not because only their work counts, but because a great founder can help everyone at the company do their best. Needing unique founders doesn’t mean we should treat them like heroes who work all alone and depend on no one. In that way, Ayn Rand’s stories were only partly right: her bad guys were real, but her heroes were not. There’s no perfect place where people live completely separate from society. Thinking you are totally independent and better than everyone else isn’t strength; it means you’ve confused what people say about you with the truth. The biggest risk for a founder is believing too much in their own story and losing touch with reality.

But just as bad for a business is to lose all belief in stories and think being unhappy with things is the same as being smart.
