The future depends a lot on planning and using special technology that only certain companies have. Public opinion and public relations are important too. People like Pythagoras, Ayn Rand, and John Rawls have ideas that connect to this.

There was a recession in the mid-1990s, and recruiting workers is a big part of business. Sometimes companies face repeated failures, but renewable energy and research help improve things. Restaurants and risks also play roles in the economy.

Some businesses are complicated and hard for people who donâ€™t use them to understand. People like Sheryl Sandberg and Eric Schmidt are important in tech, especially with search engines and secrets about how companies work. Self-driving cars and service businesses are becoming more common.

Famous people like Shakespeare, Theodore Roosevelt, and others have influenced ideas that still matter. Places like Silicon Valley are known for tech and innovation, and shows like Shark Tank highlight new business ideas.
