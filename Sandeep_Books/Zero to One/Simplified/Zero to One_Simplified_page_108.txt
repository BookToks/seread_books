COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES

Computers and humans work better together, and this idea isn’t just true on a big scale. It’s also how you build a successful business. I learned this when I worked at PayPal.

In 2000, after the dot-com crash, PayPal was growing fast but had a big problem: we were losing over $10 million every month because of credit card fraud. We were handling hundreds or even thousands of transactions every minute, so no human team could check them all.

So, like any engineers, we tried to fix this with automation. Max Levchin put together a group of top mathematicians to study the fraud carefully. Then we wrote software to spot and stop fake transactions automatically. But the fraudsters quickly changed their tricks, and our software couldn’t keep up.

Even though the fraudsters fooled our software, our human analysts could still spot the scams. So Max and the team combined both: the computer would highlight suspicious transactions, and humans would make the final call. We called this system “Igor,” after a Russian fraudster who bragged we couldn’t catch him.

Thanks to Igor, PayPal made its first profit in early 2002, after losing millions the year before. The FBI even asked to use Igor to fight financial crime. Max proudly said he was like “Sherlock Holmes of the Internet Underground.” This teamwork between humans and machines helped PayPal survive, letting many small businesses accept payments online. Most people never saw this system, but it was crucial.

After selling PayPal in 2002, I kept thinking: if humans and computers together work so well, what other businesses could use this idea? In 2003, I talked to my Stanford friend Alex Karp and software engineer Stephen Cohen about a new startup. We wanted to use the human-computer mix from PayPal to find terrorist networks and financial fraud.

We knew the FBI was interested, so in 2004 we started Palantir, a software company that helps people find important info from different sources. By 2014, Palantir was making $1 billion in sales. Forbes called its software a “killer app,” saying it helped the government find Osama bin Laden.

We can’t share details about that, but we know humans alone or computers alone can’t keep us safe. America’s two biggest spy agencies think differently: the CIA trusts humans more, while the NSA relies on computers. CIA analysts get overwhelmed by too much info, and NSA machines can handle tons of data but can’t decide if someone plans a terrorist attack.

Palantir tries to fix this by combining both. Its software looks at government data—like phone records of suspicious people or bank accounts linked to terror groups—and alerts trained analysts to check out the most dangerous activity.
