In the 1950s, Americans believed that planning big ideas for the future was too important to leave only to experts.

After feeling negative for a short time in the 1970s, Americans have mostly stayed hopeful since 1982, when the stock market started doing really well. Since then, money and finance became more important than building or inventing new things. People who are hopeful about the future believe it will get better, but they don’t know exactly how, so they don’t make clear plans. They think they will benefit from the future but don’t try to shape it carefully.

Instead of spending years creating new products, hopeful people rearrange things that already exist. Bankers make money by changing how companies are set up. Lawyers solve problems about old stuff or help people organize their business. Private equity investors and consultants don’t start new companies; they just try to make old ones work better by improving processes. It makes sense that many high-achieving people from top schools like these jobs because they offer a fancy, flexible career that helps them “keep options open” after years of building their resumes.
