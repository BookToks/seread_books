What does a company with lots of money coming in for a long time look like? Every monopoly is different, but they usually have some mix of these things: special technology, network effects, big cost savings from doing things at scale, and strong branding.

This isn’t a checklist to follow to build a monopoly—there’s no easy way to become one.

But thinking about your business with these ideas in mind can help you make it last.

1. Special Technology

Having special technology is the biggest advantage a company can have because it makes your product hard or impossible for others to copy. For example, Google’s search system gives better results than anyone else’s. Their fast page loading and smart search suggestions make their service even stronger and harder to beat. It would be really tough for anyone to take over Google like Google did to other search engines in the early 2000s.

A good rule is that your special technology needs to be at least 10 times better than the closest alternative to really create a monopoly. Anything less just seems like a small improvement and is hard to sell, especially in crowded markets.

The best way to be 10 times better is to invent something totally new. If you create something valuable that didn’t exist before, the value can be huge. For example, a drug that lets people skip sleep safely or a cure for baldness would definitely create a monopoly.

Or you can make an existing product way better: once you’re 10 times better, you leave the competition behind.

PayPal, for example, made buying and selling on eBay at least 10 times easier. Instead of waiting 7 to 10 days for a check to arrive, PayPal let buyers pay right after an auction ended.

Sellers got their money immediately and knew the payment was real, unlike with checks.

Amazon made its first big improvement by offering at least 10 times more books than any other bookstore. When it started in 1995, Amazon called itself “Earth’s largest bookstore” because, unlike regular stores that keep only about 100,000 books, Amazon didn’t need to store books—they ordered them from suppliers when customers bought them. This huge advantage upset Barnes & Noble so much that they sued Amazon three days before Amazon went public, arguing it wasn’t really a bookstore but just a “book broker.”

You can also get a 10 times better product through amazing design. Before 2010, tablets were so bad that hardly anyone used them. Microsoft and Nokia made tablets earlier, but they were hard to use. Then Apple released the iPad. Apple’s design was so much better—about 10 times better—that tablets went from useless to really useful.
