WHAT’S UNDER SILICON VALLEY’S HOODIES

From the outside, everyone in your company should be different in the same way.

Unlike people on the East Coast, who wear the same skinny jeans or suits depending on their job, young people in Mountain View and Palo Alto go to work wearing T-shirts. It’s a common idea that tech workers don’t care about clothes, but if you look closely, their T-shirts have their company’s logos—and they really care about those. What makes a startup worker easy to spot is the branded T-shirt or hoodie that makes them look like their teammates. The startup uniform shows a simple but important idea: everyone at the company should be different in the same way—a group of people who are all focused on the same goal.

Max Levchin, my co-founder at PayPal, says startups should make their early team members as personally similar as possible. Startups have small teams and not much money. They have to work fast and well to succeed, and that’s easier when everyone thinks alike. The early PayPal team got along because we were all the same kind of nerd. We loved science fiction: we had to read Cryptonomicon, and we liked the capitalist Star Wars more than the communist Star Trek. Most importantly, we were all obsessed with making a digital money system that people could control, not governments. For the company to work, it didn’t matter what people looked like or where they came from, but every new worker had to be just as obsessed as the rest.
