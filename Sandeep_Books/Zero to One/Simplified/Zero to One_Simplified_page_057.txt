IS INDEFINITE OPTIMISM EVEN POSSIBLE?

What kind of future will happen if we keep being hopeful without any clear plans? If American families saved money, they could spend it later. If American companies invested, they could make more money in the future. But right now, families aren’t saving much, and companies are just holding on to cash without starting new projects because they don’t have solid plans.

There are other ways to think about the future that can work. Definite optimism means you plan and build the future you want. Definite pessimism means you copy what already exists without expecting anything new. Indefinite pessimism happens when people have low hopes and don’t try much, so that’s what usually happens. But indefinite optimism, being hopeful without plans, doesn’t seem to work: how can things get better if no one plans for it?

Most people have heard an idea that might answer this: progress without planning is called “evolution.” Darwin said life improves over time without anyone meaning it to. Every living thing is just a random change from past life, and the best changes survive.

Darwin’s theory explains animals like trilobites and dinosaurs, but does it explain things far from biology? Just like regular physics can’t explain black holes, Darwin’s ideas might not explain how to build a better society or start a new business. Still, people often compare business to Darwin’s ideas. Journalists talk about “Digital Darwinism” or “Survival of the Clickiest,” meaning companies must survive like animals in nature. In places like Silicon Valley, people say startups should be “lean” and “adapt” to changes. New business owners are told they can’t know everything ahead of time: they should listen to customers, create a simple first product, and change it over time to succeed.
