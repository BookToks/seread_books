Hipster or Unabomber?

All fundamentalists think the same way, not just terrorists and hipsters. Religious fundamentalists believe things are either simple truths or mysterious facts about God that can’t be explained. Anything in the middle is seen as wrong. In the modern religion of environmentalism, the simple truth is that we must protect the environment. Beyond that, nature knows best and can’t be questioned. People who believe in free markets think the same way. Prices are set by the market, and even a kid can check stock prices. But whether those prices make sense isn’t to be doubted; the market knows more than you ever could.

Why do so many people today believe there are no hard secrets left? It might start with geography. There are no empty places left on the map. If you grew up in the 1700s, there were still new places to explore. You might have wanted to become an explorer after hearing exciting stories. This was true through the 19th and early 20th centuries. But after that, photos from National Geographic showed everyone what faraway places look like. Today, explorers are mostly in history books and kids’ stories. Parents don’t expect their kids to become explorers anymore, just like they don’t expect them to become pirates or kings. Maybe a few uncontacted tribes still live deep in the Amazon, and the ocean depths are still a mystery. But the unknown feels less reachable than ever.

Besides the fact that physical frontiers have disappeared, four social trends have made people stop believing in secrets. First is incrementalism. From a young age, we learn to take small steps, day by day, grade by grade. If you learn something not on the test, you don’t get credit. But if you do exactly what’s asked and just a bit better than others, you get an A. This continues in college and work, where people focus on many small achievements instead of big discoveries.

Second is risk aversion. People fear secrets because they’re afraid of being wrong. A secret hasn’t been approved by most people. If you want to never make mistakes, you shouldn’t look for secrets.
