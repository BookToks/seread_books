NERDS VS. SALESMEN  

The U.S. advertising industry makes about $150 billion every year and has over 600,000 workers. The sales industry is even bigger, making $450 billion each year. Around 3.2 million Americans work in sales. Experienced bosses might think this number is too low, but engineers often don’t understand how so many people can have sales jobs.  

In Silicon Valley, nerds don’t trust advertising, marketing, and sales because they seem fake and not logical. But advertising matters because it actually works. It works on nerds, and it works on you too. You might think you’re different and that ads don’t affect you, only other people. It’s easy to ignore obvious ads, so we feel like we are independent thinkers. But advertising isn’t made to make you buy something right away; it’s made to create small ideas in your mind that will make you want to buy later. Anyone who thinks ads don’t affect them is fooling themselves twice.  

Nerds like things to be clear and honest. They add value by becoming experts at a technical skill, like coding. In engineering, a solution either works or it doesn’t. It’s easy to check if someone’s work is good because looks don’t matter much. Sales is the opposite: it’s a planned effort to change how things appear without changing what’s really there. This feels unimportant or even dishonest to engineers. They know their own jobs are hard, so when they see salespeople chatting happily on the phone or having long lunches, they think no real work is happening. People often think science and engineering are harder than they really are because their challenges are obvious.  

What nerds don’t see is that it takes a lot of hard work to make sales look easy.
