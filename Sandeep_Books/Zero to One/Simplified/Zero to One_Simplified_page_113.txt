It all started because the air in Beijing got so bad that people couldn’t see from one building to another, and even breathing was dangerous. In Bangladesh, many people were poisoned by water with arsenic, which the New York Times called “the biggest mass poisoning in history.” In the U.S., Hurricanes Ivan and Katrina showed how global warming could cause serious damage. Al Gore told us to treat these problems like a war and act fast.

People took action: many new clean energy companies were started, and investors put more than $50 billion into them. This was the beginning of the effort to clean up the planet.

But it didn’t work out. Instead of a healthier Earth, we ended up with a big clean energy bubble that burst. Solyndra is the most famous failed green company, but many others also went bankrupt—over 40 solar companies failed in 2012 alone. The main index of clean energy companies shows how badly the bubble popped.

Why did clean energy fail? Some people say it’s because the government’s support ruined it. But there were good reasons to focus on clean energy. The real story is more complicated and important than just blaming the government. Most clean energy companies failed because they didn’t answer key business questions, like: Can you build totally new technology instead of just small improvements?
