TESLA: 7 FOR 7

Tesla is one of the few clean energy companies from the last decade that is still doing really well today. They used the excitement around clean energy better than anyone else, but they also answered seven important questions right. That’s why their success teaches us a lot.

Tesla’s technology is so good that other car companies use it. For example, Daimler uses Tesla’s battery packs. Mercedes-Benz uses Tesla’s powertrain. Toyota uses a Tesla motor. Even General Motors has a special team to watch what Tesla does next. But Tesla’s biggest achievement isn’t any one part—it’s how they put many parts together to make an amazing product. The Tesla Model S sedan is beautifully designed and better than any other car. Consumer Reports gave it the highest rating ever, and Motor Trend and Automobile magazines picked it as the 2013 Car of the Year.

In 2009, it seemed likely the government would keep supporting clean energy. “Green jobs” were important, money was ready to be spent, and Congress seemed ready to pass new laws. But while others thought subsidies would last forever, Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO, saw it as a one-time chance. In January 2010, about a year and a half before Solyndra failed and made subsidies controversial, Tesla got a $465 million loan from the U.S. Department of Energy. Getting that much money was impossible before and is impossible now. There was only one moment for it, and Tesla took full advantage.

Tesla started by focusing on a small market they could own: high-end electric sports cars. Since the first Roadster was made in 2008, Tesla sold about 3,000 of them, but at $109,000 each, that still made a lot of money. Starting small let Tesla do the research and development to build the cheaper Model S. Now Tesla owns the luxury electric sedan market too. They sold over 20,000 sedans in 2013 and are ready to grow into bigger markets soon.

Tesla’s CEO is both a great engineer and a great salesman, so it’s no surprise he put together a team that’s really good at both. Elon says his staff is like “Special Forces.” There’s the regular army, which is fine, but working at Tesla means you’re stepping up your game. Most companies don’t think much about how they sell their cars, but Tesla took it seriously. They decided to control the entire sales process themselves. Other car companies have to use independent dealerships—Ford and Hyundai make cars but rely on others to sell them. Tesla sells and services its cars in its own stores. This costs more at the start but lets Tesla control the customer experience, build a stronger brand, and save money in the long run.

Tesla has a head start and is moving faster than anyone else—and that mix means they have a strong future.
