Parents of recent graduates often support the usual path to success. The Baby Boom generation grew up thinking things would always get better without much effort. If you were born between 1945 and 1955, life kept improving every year during your childhood, and it wasn’t because of anything you did. Technology seemed to get better on its own, so Boomers had big hopes but didn’t make clear plans to reach them.

But when technology stopped improving quickly in the 1970s, rich Boomers still got richer because of growing income inequality. Their lives kept getting better automatically, but many others were left behind. The rich Boomers who influence today’s opinions don’t see a reason to doubt their hopeful thinking. Since their steady careers worked well for them, they believe the same will work for their kids.

Malcolm Gladwell says you can’t understand Bill Gates’s success without knowing about his lucky background: a good family, a private school with computers, and a childhood friend like Paul Allen. But maybe you can’t understand Gladwell himself without knowing he’s a Boomer, born in 1963. When Boomers explain why someone is successful, they focus on luck. But they often miss the bigger picture: their whole generation learned to overestimate luck and underestimate planning. Gladwell seems to challenge the idea of a self-made person, but his story actually fits the usual Boomer way of thinking.
