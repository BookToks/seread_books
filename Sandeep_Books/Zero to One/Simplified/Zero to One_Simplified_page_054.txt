You can see a change to a less certain way of thinking not just in politics but also in the ideas of political philosophers on both the left and right.

Ancient philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, and Lucretius were pretty negative. They believed humans had strict limits and the main question was how to deal with our difficult fate. Modern philosophers, on the other hand, were mostly hopeful. Thinkers like Herbert Spencer, Hegel, and Marx believed in progress. They thought that material and technological advances would make life better for everyone. They were definite optimists.

In the late 20th century, a new kind of thinking called indefinite philosophy became popular. Two important political thinkers, John Rawls and Robert Nozick, are often seen as very different. Rawls, on the left, cared about fairness and how resources are shared. Nozick, on the right, focused on individual freedom. Both believed people could live together peacefully, so they were optimistic. But unlike earlier thinkers, they didn’t have a clear idea of what the future would look like.

Rawls and Nozick had different ways of being indefinite. Rawls started his book, A Theory of Justice, with the “veil of ignorance,” which means fair decisions can’t be made if you know too much about the real world. Instead of changing the actual world with its unique people and technology, Rawls imagined a stable society that was very fair but not very exciting. Nozick disagreed with Rawls’s idea of justice based on patterns. He believed any voluntary trade should be allowed, and no social system should be kept in place by force.
