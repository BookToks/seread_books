THE LAST WILL BE FIRST

You’ve probably heard about “first mover advantage”: if you’re the first to enter a market, you can grab a lot of customers while others are just starting. But being first is just a strategy, not the main goal.

What really matters is making money in the future. So being first doesn’t help if someone else comes later and takes your place. It’s actually better to be the last mover—that means making the final big move in a market and enjoying many years of big profits.

The best way to do this is to focus on a small part of the market and grow from there, aiming for your big long-term goal. In this way, business is like chess.

Grandmaster José Raúl Capablanca said it well: to win, “you must study the endgame before everything else.”
