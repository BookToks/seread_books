Energy problems need smart engineering, so you’d expect tech experts to run clean energy companies. But that’s not true: the ones that failed were led by people who didn’t really understand the technology. These sales-focused leaders were good at getting money and government help, but bad at making products people actually wanted.

At Founders Fund, we noticed this early. One big sign was how these leaders dressed: clean energy bosses wore suits and ties. This was a red flag because real tech people usually wear T-shirts and jeans. So, we made a rule: don’t invest in any company whose founders dressed up for meetings. Maybe we could have avoided bad investments by studying the technology more, but this rule helped us figure it out faster. Good sales are quiet. It’s okay if a CEO can sell, but if they look like a salesman, they’re probably not good at sales or tech.
