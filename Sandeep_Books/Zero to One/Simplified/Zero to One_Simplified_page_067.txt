Even investors who focus on fast-growing startups often don’t notice the power law, so it’s no surprise that most people miss it too. Power law patterns are huge and easy to overlook.

For example, when people outside Silicon Valley think about venture capital, they might imagine a small, strange group—like the TV show Shark Tank but without the ads. Actually, less than 1% of new businesses in the U.S. get venture capital each year, and the total money from venture capital is less than 0.2% of the country’s economy.

But the companies that do get this money have a big impact on the economy. Venture-backed companies create 11% of all private jobs. They also make money equal to 21% of the U.S. economy each year. In fact, the 12 biggest tech companies all got venture capital. Together, these 12 companies are worth over $2 trillion, which is more than all other tech companies combined.
