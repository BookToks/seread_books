The math rule about the sides of a triangle, like the one we use today, was a secret for thousands of years.

Pythagoras had to work really hard to figure it out. If you wanted to learn his new idea back then, joining his weird vegetarian group was the best way to find out about it. Now, his math is just a normal fact we teach kids in school. Normal facts can be important—like basic math—but they don’t give you a special advantage. They aren’t secrets.

Think about our tricky question: what important truth do very few people agree with you on?

If we already know everything about the world, if all our current ideas are perfect, and if nothing new can be done, then there are no good answers. Thinking differently only makes sense if the world still has secrets to discover.

Sure, there are lots of things we don’t understand yet, but some might be impossible to figure out—mysteries, not secrets. For example, string theory talks about the universe using tiny vibrating strings. Is string theory true? We can’t really test it with experiments. Almost no one can understand all of it. But is that because it’s super hard or because it’s impossible? That matters. You can do hard things, but you can’t do the impossible.

Remember the business version of our tricky question: what valuable company is nobody making? Every good answer has to be a secret: something important and unknown, something hard but possible. If there are many secrets left in the world, there are probably many big companies waiting to be started. This chapter will help you think about secrets and how to find them.
