Extreme leader stories aren’t new. Old myths have lots of them. Oedipus is a classic example: he was left as a baby and grew up in a foreign place, but he became a smart king who solved the Sphinx’s riddle.

Romulus and Remus were born into royalty but were left as orphans. When they found out they were royal, they wanted to start a city. But they argued about where to build it. When Remus crossed the line Romulus set, Romulus killed him and said, “Anyone who jumps over my wall will die.” Romulus was both a lawmaker and a lawbreaker, a criminal and a king, both inside and outside the group.

Regular people aren’t like Oedipus or Romulus. The stories only remember their extreme parts. But why did old cultures care so much about remembering these special people?

Famous and hated people have always shown how society feels. People praise them when times are good and blame them when things go wrong. Early societies had one big problem: they could fall apart if people kept fighting. So when bad things like sickness or fights happened, it helped to blame one person, someone everyone agreed on. This person was called a scapegoat.

Who makes a good scapegoat? Like founders, scapegoats are extreme and mixed-up figures. They are weak because they can’t stop being blamed. But they are also powerful because they stop fights by taking the blame.

Before being killed, scapegoats were often treated like gods. The Aztecs saw their victims as gods on Earth before sacrifice. They wore nice clothes and had big feasts until their short rule ended and their hearts were taken out. This is where kings come from: every king was like a god, and every god was once a killed king. Maybe every king today is just a scapegoat who has delayed being killed.
