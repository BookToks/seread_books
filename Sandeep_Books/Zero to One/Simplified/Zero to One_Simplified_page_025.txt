We had fewer workers than the restaurants on Castro Street, but our business was worth way more than all those restaurants put together. Starting a new South Indian restaurant is really hard if you want to make money. If you ignore what your competitors are doing and only care about small things—like thinking your naan is better because of your great-grandmother’s recipe—your business probably won’t last.

Creative industries are like that too. No screenwriter wants to admit that their new movie script is just a copy of something already made. Instead, they say: “This movie will mix cool things in totally new ways.” Sometimes that might be true. Imagine a movie where Jay-Z stars in a mix of Hackers and Jaws: a rap star joins a hacker group to catch the shark that killed his friend. That’s never been done before. But, like there not being many British restaurants in Palo Alto, maybe that’s actually a good reason.

People who don’t have a monopoly make their market seem smaller by mixing together small groups: British food ∩ restaurant ∩ Palo Alto Rap star ∩ hackers ∩ sharks But people with monopolies hide it by mixing big groups together: search engine ∪ mobile phones ∪ wearable computers ∪ self-driving cars What does this look like in real life? Look at what Google chairman Eric Schmidt said in 2011 at a congressional hearing: We face a super competitive world where people have tons of ways to get information.
