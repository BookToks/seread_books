THE MYTH OF SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP

Cleantech entrepreneurs wanted more than just regular business success. The cleantech bubble was the biggest trend—and the biggest failure—in the history of “social entrepreneurship.” This way of doing business starts with the idea that companies and charities have been very different: companies have a lot of power but only care about making money; charities want to help people but don’t have much influence in the economy. Social entrepreneurs try to mix the best parts of both and “do well by doing good.” But most of the time, they don’t succeed at either.

The mix-up between social and money goals makes things confusing. But the word “social” is even more confusing: does “socially good” mean good for society, or just seen as good by people? If something is liked by everyone, it’s usually just normal, like the broad idea of green energy.

Progress isn’t stopped because companies are greedy and charities are good. Instead, it’s because they are too similar. Companies copy each other, and charities focus on the same things. Cleantech shows this: hundreds of similar products all aiming for the same big goal.

Doing something different is what really helps society—and it’s also how a business can make money by being the only one in a new market. The best projects often get ignored, not celebrated; the best problems to solve are usually the ones no one else tries to fix.
