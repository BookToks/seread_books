The big differences between people and computers mean we get more benefits by working with computers than by trading with other people. We don’t trade with computers like we do with animals or lamps. That’s because computers are tools, not competitors.

The differences go even deeper when we look at what they need. Unlike people in developing countries, computers don’t want fancy food or expensive houses. They only need a little electricity, and they don’t even know they need it.

When we create new computer technology to help solve problems, we get all the advantages of a super-skilled partner without having to fight with them for resources. If we understand this right, technology helps us avoid competition in a world that’s becoming more connected. As computers get stronger, they won’t replace humans—they will work together with us.
