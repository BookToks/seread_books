OUR INDEFINITELY OPTIMISTIC WORLD

Indefinite Finance

A clearly hopeful future might need engineers to build underwater cities or space colonies. But an endlessly hopeful future needs more bankers and lawyers. Finance shows indefinite thinking because it’s how people try to make money when they don’t really know how to create real wealth.

If smart college grads don’t go to law school, they often go to Wall Street because they don’t have a clear plan for their careers. Once they get to places like Goldman Sachs, they see that even in finance, nothing is certain. It’s still hopeful—you wouldn’t invest if you expected to lose—but the main idea is that the market is random; you can’t really know what will happen. So spreading out your investments is super important.

The uncertainty in finance can be weird. Think about what happens when successful business owners sell their companies. What do they do with the money? In today’s world:  
- The founders don’t know what to do with it, so they give it to a big bank.  
- The bankers don’t know what to do with it, so they spread it out among many investors.  
- The investors don’t know what to do with it, so they buy lots of different stocks.  
- Companies try to raise their stock prices by making more cash. If they succeed, they pay dividends or buy back shares, and the cycle keeps going.

No one in this chain really knows how to use money to help the real economy. But in an indefinite world, people actually like having lots of options; money itself becomes more valuable than what you can do with it. Only in a clear future is money a tool to reach goals, not the goal itself.

Indefinite Politics

Politicians have always had to answer to voters during elections, but now they watch what people think all the time. Modern polls let politicians shape their image to match what people want to hear, so usually, that’s what they do. Nate Silver’s election predictions are very accurate, but what’s even crazier is how much attention these predictions get every four years. Today, we care more about guessing what people will think in a few weeks than about imagining what the country will be like in 10 or 20 years.

It’s not just elections—the whole government has become uncertain, too. The government used to solve big problems like nuclear weapons and moon missions. But after 40 years of uncertainty, the government mostly just provides insurance. Our answers to big problems are programs like Medicare, Social Security, and many others that send money to people. It’s not surprising that spending on these programs has been bigger than other government spending since 1975. To spend more on new projects, we’d need clear plans to fix specific issues. But with indefinite thinking, we just believe things get better by sending out more checks.
