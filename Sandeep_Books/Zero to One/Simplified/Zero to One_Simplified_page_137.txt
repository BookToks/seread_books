Maybe the only way to be a rock star forever is to die young.

We both admire and hate tech founders, kind of like how we feel about celebrities. Howard Hughes’s story, going from famous to sad, is one of the most extreme in the 20th century. He was born rich but cared more about building things than living in luxury. When he was 11, he made Houston’s first radio transmitter. The next year, he built the city’s first motorcycle. By the time he was 30, he had made nine successful movies while Hollywood was still new with technology. But Hughes was even more famous for flying. He designed, built, and flew planes himself. He set records for flying the fastest, the quickest across the country, and around the world.

Hughes was obsessed with flying higher than anyone else. He often said he was just a normal guy, not a god—but people usually say that when they want you to think they are like gods. His lawyer once said in court that Hughes was “a man you can’t judge like normal people.” Hughes paid the lawyer to say this, but even the judge and jury agreed. When Hughes won the Congressional Gold Medal in 1939 for his flying achievements, he didn’t even come to get it. Years later, President Truman found it in the White House and mailed it to him.

Hughes’s troubles started in 1946 when he had his third and worst plane crash.

If he had died then, people would have remembered him as one of the coolest and most successful Americans ever. But he barely lived. After that, he became obsessed with being clean and organized, got addicted to painkillers, and stayed away from everyone. He spent the last 30 years of his life alone. Hughes had always acted a bit crazy, hoping that if people thought he was weird, they wouldn’t bother him. But when his weirdness turned into real problems, people felt sorry for him as much as they admired him.
