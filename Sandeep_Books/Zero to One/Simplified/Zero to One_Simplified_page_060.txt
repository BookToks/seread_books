YOU ARE NOT A LOTTERY TICKET

We need to find a clear path to the future, and the Western world needs a big change in culture to get there.

Where should we start? We might need to stop listening so much to people like John Rawls in philosophy classes. Malcolm Gladwell should rethink his ideas. And pollsters shouldn’t have so much power in politics.

But these professors, writers, and politicians don’t like to change their minds. It’s really hard to make changes when there are so many people involved, even if they mean well.

Starting a new business is one of the biggest things you can fully control. You can take charge not just of your own life but also of something small and important in the world. It all starts by saying no to the unfair idea of luck deciding everything. You are not just a lottery ticket.
