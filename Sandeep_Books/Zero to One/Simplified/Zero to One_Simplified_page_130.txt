But that doesn’t explain the weirdest thing about founders. Usually, we think opposite traits can’t happen at the same time. For example, a person can’t be both rich and poor at once.  

But for founders, it happens all the time. Startup CEOs might have little cash but still be millionaires on paper. They can switch between being grumpy and being really charming.  

Almost all successful entrepreneurs are both insiders and outsiders at the same time. When they succeed, they get both famous and sometimes hated.  

If you look closely, founders’ traits seem to follow a strange pattern. So, where do these weird and extreme traits come from?
