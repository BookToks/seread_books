Think about how much the New York Times Company and Twitter are worth. Both have a few thousand workers and help millions of people get news. But when Twitter started selling shares in 2013, it was valued at $24 billion—over 12 times more than the Times—even though the Times made $133 million in 2012 and Twitter was losing money. Why was Twitter worth so much more?

The answer is cash flow. This might seem strange because the Times was making money while Twitter wasn’t. But a great business is about how much money it can make in the future. Investors believe Twitter will make a lot of money in the next ten years, while newspapers aren’t the only source for news anymore.

Simply put, a business’s value today is all the money it will make in the future added together.

To figure out a business’s real value, you also have to think about how money now is worth more than the same amount later. Comparing this way shows the big difference between slow-growing businesses and fast-growing startups. Most slow-growth businesses are only worth what they make soon. A business like a newspaper might keep its value if it can keep making money for five or six years. But if a company has many competitors, its profits usually go down.

Nightclubs or restaurants are good examples: they might make good money now, but their earnings will likely drop as people go to newer places.

Technology companies are different. They often lose money at first because it takes time to create valuable products, so their profits come later. Most of a tech company’s value comes from money it will make 10 to 15 years in the future.
