This question sounds easy because it’s simple. But actually, it’s very hard to answer. It’s hard to think about because what we learn in school is something everyone agrees on. It’s also hard because anyone who tries to answer has to say something that most people don’t like. Smart ideas are rare, but being brave enough to share them is even rarer.

Usually, I hear answers like these: “Our school system is broken and needs fixing.” “America is special.” “There is no God.” These are bad answers. The first two might be true, but a lot of people already agree with them. The third one just picks a side in a common argument. A good answer sounds like this: “Most people believe in x, but the truth is the opposite.” I’ll share my own answer later in this chapter.

What does this tricky question have to do with the future? At the simplest, the future is just all the time that hasn’t happened yet. But what makes the future special is that it will be different from today.

If nothing changes in our society for 100 years, then the future is really far away. But if big changes happen soon, the future is almost here. No one can know exactly what will happen, but we do know two things: it will be different, and it will come from what’s happening now. Most answers to the tricky question are just new ways of looking at today. Good answers are the closest we can get to seeing the future.
