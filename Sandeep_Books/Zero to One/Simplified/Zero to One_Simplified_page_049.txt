Even today, many parts of the world are still full of negative thoughts. An indefinite pessimist sees a sad future but doesn’t know what to do about it. This has been true for Europe since the early 1970s, when the continent started drifting without clear direction. Right now, the whole Eurozone is slowly falling apart, and no one is really in charge. The European Central Bank doesn’t have a clear plan; while the U.S. Treasury prints “In God We Trust” on the dollar, the ECB might as well print “Kick the Can Down the Road” on the euro. Europeans just react to problems as they come and hope things don’t get worse. The indefinite pessimist can’t tell if the decline will be fast or slow, or really bad or just a little bad. All they can do is wait, so they might as well enjoy life for now. That’s why Europe is famous for loving vacations.

A definite pessimist believes they can predict the future, but since it looks bad, they think they must get ready for it. Surprisingly, China is probably the most definitely pessimistic place today.

When Americans see China’s economy growing super fast (about 10% every year since 2000), they think China is confident and in control of its future. But that’s because Americans are still optimistic and assume China feels the same. From China’s view, the economy can’t grow fast enough. While other countries worry China will take over the world, China is actually scared it won’t.

China grows so fast because it started from a very low point. The easiest way for China to grow is by copying what’s already worked in the West. And that’s exactly what they’re doing: following strict plans, burning more coal, and building more factories and tall buildings. But because China has so many people, resources get more expensive, and there’s no way Chinese living standards will ever fully catch up with the richest countries. The Chinese know this.

That’s why China’s leaders worry a lot about things getting worse.

Every top Chinese leader lived through famine as a kid, so when they think about the future, disaster feels real. The Chinese people know tough times are coming too. Outsiders are amazed by the big fortunes made in China, but they don’t notice rich Chinese people trying hard to move their money out of the country. Poorer Chinese save everything they can and hope it will be enough. Everyone in China takes the future very seriously.

A definite optimist believes the future can be better than today if they plan and work for it. From the 1600s through the 1950s and ’60s, definite optimists led the Western world.

Scientists, engineers, doctors, and businesspeople made the world richer, healthier, and longer-lasting than ever before. As Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels pointed out, the 19th-century business class created more powerful tools and machines than all the generations before them combined. They used nature’s forces, machinery, chemistry, steamships, railways, telegraphs, cleared huge lands for farming, changed rivers, and built whole new cities—no earlier time even dreamed of such amazing progress.
