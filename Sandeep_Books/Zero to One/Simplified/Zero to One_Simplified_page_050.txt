Every generation of inventors and dreamers did more than the one before. In 1843, people in London were able to travel under the River Thames for the first time through a new tunnel. In 1869, the Suez Canal made it easier for ships to travel between Europe and Asia without going all the way around Africa. In 1914, the Panama Canal made the trip between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans much shorter.

Even during the Great Depression, progress in the United States didn’t stop. The Empire State Building was started in 1929 and finished in 1931. The Golden Gate Bridge was built between 1933 and 1937. The Manhattan Project began in 1941 and created the first nuclear bomb by 1945. Americans kept changing the world during peaceful times too: they started building the Interstate Highway System in 1956, and by 1965, 20,000 miles of road were ready to drive on. People even planned beyond Earth: NASA’s Apollo Program began in 1961 and sent 12 men to the moon before it ended in 1972.

Big ideas weren’t only from government leaders or scientists. In the late 1940s, a man named John Reber from California wanted to change the whole San Francisco Bay Area. Reber was a teacher, theater producer, and a self-taught engineer. Even without official experience, he suggested building two huge dams in the Bay, making big freshwater lakes for drinking and farming, and creating 20,000 acres of new land. Although he didn’t have any power, people took his plan seriously. Newspapers across California supported it, Congress talked about it, and the Army Corps of Engineers made a 1.5-acre model of the Bay to test the idea. The tests showed problems, so the plan was never done.

But would anyone take such a big idea seriously today? In the 1950s, people liked big plans and wanted to see if they could work. Now, a big plan from a teacher would probably be called crazy, and a plan from a powerful person might be seen as too arrogant. You can still visit the Bay Model in Sausalito, but now it’s just a tourist spot. Big plans for the future seem old-fashioned and rare today.
