Lately, Bill Gates has shown that being very successful can also bring a lot of focused criticism.

Gates was the perfect example of a founder: he was both a shy, nerdy college dropout and the richest insider in the world. Did he wear his geeky glasses on purpose to create a unique image? Or did his nerdy personality just make him wear those glasses? It’s hard to say. But there’s no doubt he was very powerful: in 2000, Microsoft’s Windows controlled 90% of the operating system market. That year, TV host Peter Jennings even asked, “Who is more important right now: Bill Clinton or Bill Gates? I don’t know. It’s a good question.” The U.S. government didn’t just ask questions—they started an investigation and sued Microsoft for unfair business practices. In June 2000, a court said Microsoft should be broken up. Gates had already stepped down as CEO six months before, because he had to spend most of his time dealing with legal problems instead of making new technology.

Later, a higher court canceled the breakup order, and Microsoft made a deal with the government in 2001. But by that time, Gates’s opponents had already stopped him from fully focusing on his company, and Microsoft didn’t grow much after that. Today, Gates is better known for giving away money and helping others than for making new technology.
