THE SECRET QUESTION

Every clean energy company believed it was important to help make the world cleaner.

They thought that because people really needed alternative energy, their companies would automatically make a lot of money.

By 2006, many people were very excited about solar power. That year, President George W. Bush talked about a future where families could make their own electricity with solar roofs. Investor Bill Gross said solar power had huge potential. Suvi Sharma, CEO of a solar company, said it felt like a gold rush, but there was real value there—like sunshine.

But many solar companies rushed in and failed fast, like Q-Cells, Evergreen Solar, SpectraWatt, and even Bill Gross’s own company, Energy Innovations. They all talked about their bright futures based on ideas everyone believed in. 

Great companies have secrets: special reasons they succeed that others don’t notice.
