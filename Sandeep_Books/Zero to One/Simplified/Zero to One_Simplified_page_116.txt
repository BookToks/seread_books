THE TIMING QUESTION

Cleantech entrepreneurs really wanted to believe that their time had finally come.

When Andrew Wilson, the CEO of SpectraWatt, announced his new company in 2008, he said that the solar industry was like the computer chip industry in the late 1970s. He meant there was still a lot to figure out and make better. The part about needing improvement was true, but the comparison to computer chips was way off.

Since the first microprocessor was made in 1970, computers got better really fast, growing at an amazing rate. For example, Intel released new products often and quickly. But solar cells are different. The first silicon solar cell was made back in 1954 by Bell Labs—more than 50 years before Wilson’s announcement. Solar panels got better over the years, but just slowly and step by step. Bell’s first solar cell had about 6% efficiency, and even today, the best solar panels don’t go over 25% efficiency when used in real life.

In the mid-2000s, there weren’t many new ideas or improvements that showed solar power was about to take off. Joining a slow-moving market can be smart, but only if you have a clear and realistic plan to succeed. The cleantech companies that failed didn’t have that.
