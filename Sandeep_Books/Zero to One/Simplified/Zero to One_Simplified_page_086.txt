Bob Dylan once said that if you’re not busy being born, you’re busy dying. If he’s right, being born doesn’t happen just once—you might keep being born in a way, at least in a poetic sense. But the founding moment of a company really happens only once: only at the very beginning can you set the rules that help people work together to create value later on.

The most valuable companies stay open to new ideas, which is something that usually happens at the start. This gives us a second, less obvious idea about founding: it lasts as long as the company keeps creating new things, and it ends when the company stops creating. If you get the founding moment right, you can do more than just build a valuable company—you can guide its future so it keeps making new things instead of just managing past success. You might even keep its founding spirit going forever.
