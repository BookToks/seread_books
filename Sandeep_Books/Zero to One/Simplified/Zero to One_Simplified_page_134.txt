The most famous people in the world are also founders, but instead of starting companies, they create and grow their own personal brands. Lady Gaga, for example, became one of the most important people alive.

But is she even a real person? Her real name isn’t a secret, but almost no one knows it or cares. She wears crazy costumes that are so weird they might make others think she needs to see a doctor.

Gaga wants you to believe she was “born this way,” which is the name of her second album and its main song. But no one is born looking like a zombie with horns on their head. So, Gaga must have made up this image herself.

Still, what kind of person would do that to themselves? Probably no normal person. So maybe Gaga really was born that way after all.
