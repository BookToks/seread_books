Globalization and technology are two different ways the world can improve. You can have both at the same time, just one, or even neither. For example, from 1815 to 1914, there was a lot of new technology and the world became more connected. But between World War I and 1971, technology improved a lot, while the world didn’t become much more connected. Since 1971, the world has become more connected again, but new technology mostly comes from computers and the internet.

Because of this connected world, many people think the future will be more similar everywhere. Even the way we talk about countries shows this idea. Calling some countries “developed” and others “developing” makes it seem like the rich countries are finished improving, and the poorer ones just need to catch up.

But I don’t think that’s right. Most people believe globalization will shape the future, but really, technology is more important.

If technology doesn’t change, problems will get worse. For example, if China doubles how much energy it uses, pollution will also double. If millions of families in India lived like Americans do now, using today’s technology, it would seriously hurt the environment. Just copying old ways of making money everywhere will cause big problems. In a world with limited resources, we can’t rely on globalization alone without new technology.

New technology hasn’t always been a part of history. Long ago, people lived in societies where they had to take from others to succeed. They rarely made new wealth, and life was very hard for most people. After thousands of years of slow progress—from farming to windmills and old telescopes—the modern world suddenly had fast technological growth starting with the steam engine in the 1760s and continuing until about 1970.

Because of this, we now live in a richer world than people in the past could imagine.

Except for our parents and grandparents, who in the late 1960s expected this progress to keep going.
