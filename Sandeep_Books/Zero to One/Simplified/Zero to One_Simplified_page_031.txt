Competition means no one makes much money, nothing really stands out, and everyone just tries to survive.

So why do people think competition is good? It’s not just about money or a problem we have to deal with. Competition is more like a belief system that’s everywhere in our society and messes with how we think. We keep telling ourselves competition is necessary and follow its rules, but the more we compete, the less we actually gain.

This is simple, but we’ve all been taught to ignore it. Schools show how much we care about competition. Grades measure who is better, and students with the highest marks get respect and awards. Everyone learns the same stuff in mostly the same way, no matter what they’re good at or like. Kids who don’t do well sitting quietly in class feel less important, while kids who do well on tests end up seeing themselves only through school success.

It gets worse as students move up. The smartest students keep climbing the ladder until the competition gets so tough that it crushes their dreams.

College is where people with big plans in high school get stuck fighting with other smart students for common jobs like consulting and banking. Students (or their families) pay huge amounts of money for tuition that keeps going up faster than prices on everything else. Why do we put ourselves through this?

I wish I had asked myself that when I was younger. My path was so planned that in 8th grade, a friend predicted I’d enter Stanford as a sophomore. After doing well in college, I went to Stanford Law School, where I competed even harder for the usual signs of success.

The biggest prize for law students is clear: out of thousands who graduate every year, only a few get a Supreme Court clerkship. After working for a year at a federal appeals court, I got to interview for clerkships with Justices Kennedy and Scalia. The meetings went well. I was so close to winning this final competition. I thought if I got the clerkship, I’d be set for life. But I didn’t. I was really upset at the time.

In 2004, after I had built and sold PayPal, I met an old law school friend who helped me with those clerkship applications. We hadn’t talked in almost ten years. His first question wasn’t “How have you been?” or “Can you believe it’s been so long?” Instead, he smiled and asked, “So, Peter, aren’t you glad you didn’t get that clerkship?” Looking back, we both knew winning that competition would have actually made my life worse. If I had clerked on the Supreme Court, I probably would have spent my whole career doing boring legal work instead of creating new things. It’s hard to say how much would be different, but I lost a lot of chances. All Rhodes Scholars had a great past but a limited future.
