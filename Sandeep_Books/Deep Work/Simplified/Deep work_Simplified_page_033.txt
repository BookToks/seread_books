George Packer, a well-known writer for The New Yorker, explained why he doesn’t use Twitter. He said, “Twitter is like a drug for people who love the media. It scares me, not because I think I’m better than it, but because I don’t think I could handle it. I’m worried I’d end up ignoring my son’s needs.” When he wrote that, he was working on his book The Unwinding, which won a big award soon after—and maybe his success was helped by not using social media.

Big changes in business today actually make it harder for people to focus deeply on their work. Even though these changes promise things like more chances to meet people, faster replies, and more attention, the real benefits come from deep work—like learning difficult things quickly and doing really great work. This chapter wants to explain this strange problem. Deep work is rare, but not because it’s a bad habit. When we look closely, the reasons we get distracted at work are often random and based on wrong ideas, mixed with the confusing nature of knowledge jobs. The goal is to show you that even though distractions are common now, they don’t have a strong base and you can stop them if you choose to practice deep work.

In the fall of 2012, Tom Cochran, the tech boss at Atlantic Media, got worried about how much time he spent on email. Like a good tech guy, he decided to count how many emails he got and sent. In one week, he received 511 emails and sent 284, which was about 160 emails every workday. Even if he spent only 30 seconds on each email, that still took almost an hour and a half a day. That felt like a lot of time doing something that wasn’t really the main part of his job.

Cochran wrote a blog about this for the Harvard Business Review. His numbers made him wonder about the rest of his company. How much time were other employees spending moving information around instead of doing the special tasks they were hired for? So he collected data on how many emails people sent every day and how long the emails were.
