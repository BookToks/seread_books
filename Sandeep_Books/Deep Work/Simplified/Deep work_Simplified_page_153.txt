But I had been getting ready for this moment. Not only did I keep up my research work; it actually got better.

Before, as a graduate student with fewer responsibilities, I wrote two good papers a year. After becoming a busy professor, that number jumped to four good papers a year on average.

This was impressive to me, but I soon learned I hadn’t even reached the best results deep work could bring. This lesson came during my third year as a professor. From fall 2013 to summer 2014 at Georgetown, I focused again on my deep work habits, looking for ways to improve.

One big reason was the book you’re reading now—most of it was written then. Writing a seventy-thousand-word book added a new challenge to my busy schedule, and I wanted to make sure my academic work didn’t suffer.

Another reason was the tenure process. I had a year or two left before submitting my case, so this was the time to prove what I could do. This was especially important since my wife and I were planning to have a second child before tenure.

The last reason was personal and a little annoying. I had applied for a well-known grant but got rejected, while many colleagues got it. I felt upset and embarrassed, so instead of just feeling bad, I decided to work harder and publish more impressive papers to show I really knew my stuff, even if that grant didn’t work out.

I was already good at deep work, but these reasons pushed me to take it further. I started saying no to things that took up too much time and worked in quiet places outside my office. I kept track of my deep work hours on a chart near my desk and got frustrated if the number didn’t grow fast enough.

Most important, I went back to my old habit from MIT of thinking about problems in my head whenever I had free time—walking the dog, commuting, or doing chores. Before, I only worked hard when deadlines were close, but that year I was always pushing my mind to solve important problems, even without deadlines.

I solved proofs on subway rides and while shoveling snow. When my son napped on weekends, I paced outside thinking, and stuck in traffic, I worked through tough problems step by step.
