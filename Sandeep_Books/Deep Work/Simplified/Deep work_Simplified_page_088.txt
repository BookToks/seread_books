If you keep stopping your evening to check emails or spend a few hours after dinner finishing work, you’re not giving your brain the rest it needs. Even short work breaks stop you from relaxing deeply enough to recharge. Your brain only starts to relax fully when it knows you’re done with work for the day. If you try to do more work at night, you might actually be less effective the next day and get less done than if you had just stopped working.

Reason #3: The work you do during your evening break is usually not that important. Let’s go back to Anders Ericsson, who came up with the idea of deliberate practice. Deliberate practice means working hard on a skill to get better at it. It’s very similar to deep work, which is focused, hard thinking.

In a famous paper from 1993, Ericsson looked at how much hard thinking people can do each day. He found that beginners can only focus deeply for about an hour a day, while experts can do it for around four hours—but usually not more.

One study he mentioned looked at top violin players in Berlin. These players practiced deeply for about three and a half hours a day, usually split into two sessions. Players who weren’t as good practiced less deeply.

This means you can only do so much deep work in one day. If you manage your time well (with tips like those in Rule #4), you should reach your limit of deep work during the day.
