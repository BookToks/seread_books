Your willpower isn’t something you can use forever without getting tired; it’s more like a muscle that gets worn out. That’s why in the Hofmann and Baumeister study, people found it really hard to resist temptations—their willpower ran out over time, so they couldn’t fight the distractions anymore. The same thing will happen to you, no matter how much you want to focus—unless you’re smart about your habits.

This is why the strategies coming up are important: to build a strong habit of deep work, you need more than just good intentions. You need to create routines and rituals in your work life that use as little willpower as possible to start focusing and keep concentrating without breaks.

For example, if you suddenly try to switch from scrolling the web to a hard task, you’ll need a lot of willpower to pull your attention away from the distractions. This often won’t work. But if you have a smart routine, like working at the same time and quiet place every day, you’ll need less willpower to get started and keep going. This way, you’ll do better with deep work more often.

So, the six strategies that follow are like a set of routines and rituals made to fit how limited your willpower is, helping you do more deep work regularly.

These strategies will ask you to pick a schedule for deep work and develop rituals to get your brain ready before you start. Some will use simple tricks to boost your motivation, and others will help you recharge your willpower quickly.

You could just try to decide to focus more, but using these strategies—or ones you come up with that follow the same ideas—will make it way more likely that deep work becomes an important part of your life.
