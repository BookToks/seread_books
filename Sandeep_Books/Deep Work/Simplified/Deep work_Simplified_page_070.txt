By making fewer decisions about when to do deep work, I can save more brainpower for actually thinking deeply.

Scheduling deep work like a journalist does isn’t easy. But if you believe what you’re working on is important and have practiced focusing deeply (a skill we’ll keep improving with new tips), it can help you get a lot done even with a busy schedule.

People who create valuable things with their minds usually don’t work in a random way. Take Robert Caro, a famous writer who won a Pulitzer Prize. A magazine showed that everything in his office had a set place. How he arranged his books, notebooks, what he put on the walls, even what he wore to work—all followed a routine he didn’t change much. He said, “I trained myself to be organized.”

Charles Darwin had a strict daily routine when he worked on his famous book, On the Origin of Species. His son said Darwin got up at seven, took a short walk, ate breakfast alone, then worked in his study from eight to nine thirty. After that, he spent an hour reading letters, then worked again from ten thirty to noon. Later, he thought about hard problems while walking a set path on his property. He kept walking until he felt satisfied with his thoughts, then stopped working for the day.

Mason Currey, a writer who studied the habits of famous thinkers and artists, said that people often think artists wait for a sudden burst of inspiration to work. But he says that’s a bad idea. The best advice he can give to anyone trying to be creative is to ignore inspiration and just work regularly.
