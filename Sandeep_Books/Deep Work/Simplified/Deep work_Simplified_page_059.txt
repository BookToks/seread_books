Before we get into the strategies, I want to answer a question you might have: Why do we need such complicated methods? If deep work is important, can’t we just start doing more of it? Do we really need something as fancy as the Eudaimonia Machine just to help us focus better?

The truth is, it’s not that simple to replace distractions with focus. One big problem is the constant urge to pay attention to easy, fun stuff instead of hard work. Most people know this urge makes focusing tough, but they don’t realize how often and how strong it really is.

A 2012 study by psychologists Wilhelm Hofmann and Roy Baumeister tested this by giving 205 adults beepers that went off at random times. When the beeper rang, they had to think about any desires they felt recently and answer questions about them. After a week, the researchers had over 7,500 samples. What they found was that people deal with desires all day long. Baumeister said, “Desire turned out to be the norm, not the exception.” The top five desires included eating, sleeping, and sex, but also things like taking breaks from hard work, checking email or social media, surfing the web, listening to music, or watching TV. The internet and TV were especially hard to resist, with people only able to say no about half the time.

This is bad news if you want to build a deep work habit. It shows that you’ll constantly feel like doing anything but deep work, and if you’re like the people in the study, these urges will often win.

You might think you’ll do better because you know deep work is important and willpower will help you stay focused. That sounds good, but research shows it’s not that simple. Studies, especially by Baumeister, have proven that willpower is limited and gets used up the more you use it.
