A Philosophical Argument for Depth

Our last reason for linking depth and meaning asks us to think more deeply and less about science, like brain stuff or psychology, and more about big ideas. To help with this, I’ll talk about two experts who know a lot about philosophy: Hubert Dreyfus, who taught at Berkeley for over 40 years, and Sean Dorrance Kelly, who is the head of Harvard’s philosophy department right now.

In 2011, Dreyfus and Kelly wrote a book called All Things Shining. It looks at how ideas about what is special and meaningful have changed throughout history. They wanted to understand this because they are worried about what things are like today.

They say, “The world used to be full of sacred, shining things.” But now, those shining things feel far away. What changed? They say it’s because of a thinker named Descartes. Descartes started an idea that people should trust themselves to find the truth, not God or kings. This led to the Enlightenment, which helped people get freedom and human rights.

But, Dreyfus and Kelly point out, even though this was good for politics, it made the world feel less meaningful and less ordered in a spiritual way. Now, we have to decide what matters on our own, which can feel random and make life seem pointless. They worry this way of thinking makes life not just boring, but almost impossible to live happily.

At first, this might seem far from understanding why we feel deep satisfaction. But their answer to this problem gives us new ideas about how meaning comes from work and skill. This makes sense because their solution is based on something we talked about in the beginning of this chapter: the craftsman.

In the end of their book, Dreyfus and Kelly say that being a craftsman is a way to bring back a sense of something sacred and meaningful in a real and responsible way. To explain this, they tell a story about a master wheelwright—a skilled person who made wooden wagon wheels, a job that no longer exists.
