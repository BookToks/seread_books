Rule #4 says people should enjoy nice weather in the summer. Jason Fried decided to change his company, 37signals (now called Basecamp), to a four-day workweek. He wrote about this in “Workplace Experiments: A Month to Yourself.”

Some people criticize the idea of packing 40 work hours into four days. For example, a Forbes article by Tara Weiss said a four-day workweek doesn’t work well.

But Jason Fried replied on his company blog that most people don’t even work full 8-hour days. The real point of the four-day workweek is to work smarter, not longer.

Fried also said he would prefer to work five days in a row, but shorter days.

He talked about how his company could afford to give workers a month off in an article on Inc.com.

Matt Welsh talked about the busy travel life of junior faculty in his blog post called “The Fame Trap.”
