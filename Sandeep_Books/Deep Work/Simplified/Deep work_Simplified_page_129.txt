For most businesses, if you got rid of a lot of the shallow, less important work, their profits probably wouldn’t change much. Jason Fried found out that if you not only cut out shallow work but also use that saved time for more deep, important work, the business can actually do better.

This idea asks you to do the same with your own work. The tips that follow will help you spot the shallow stuff in your schedule and cut it down as much as possible—so you have more time for the deep work that really matters.

But before getting into these tips, remember there’s a limit to how much deep work you can do. Deep work is way more valuable than shallow work, but that doesn’t mean you should spend all your time on it. You still need to do some shallow work to keep most jobs going.

For example, you might stop checking your email every ten minutes, but you can’t ignore important messages forever. So, the goal here is to reduce shallow work, not get rid of it completely.

Also, deep work is tiring because it pushes your brain to its limits. Experts have studied how long people can do this kind of focused work each day. For beginners, like kids learning a new skill, about an hour a day is realistic. For people used to this kind of work, the limit is about four hours, but rarely more.

This means that once you hit your deep work limit for the day, trying to do more won’t help much. Shallow work only becomes a problem if it starts taking up time that you could spend on your limited deep work. This might sound like good news. A normal workday is eight hours, and even the best deep workers can only spend about half of that on deep work. So, you could spend the other half on shallow work without any problems.

But the tricky part is how easily shallow work can fill your day, especially when you have meetings, calls, and appointments that take up time.
