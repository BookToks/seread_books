The New York Times has a team focused on social media, with more than 800 employees tweeting regularly.

For example, I found an article by Alissa Rubin while working on this chapter: Rubin, Alissa J., and Maïa de la Baume wrote “Claims of French Complicity in Rwanda’s Genocide Rekindle Mutual Resentment,” published in the New York Times on April 8, 2014.

Neil Postman wrote a book called Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology, published in 1993.

He said, “It does not make them illegal” (page 48).

Evgeny Morozov wrote in his book To Save Everything, Click Here (2013), “It’s this tendency to see ‘the Internet’ as a source of wisdom” (page 25).
