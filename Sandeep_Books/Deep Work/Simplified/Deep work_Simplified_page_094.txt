People who always try to do many things at once can’t ignore distractions. They struggle to remember what they need to do right now. They get distracted all the time. Their brain uses too many parts that don’t help with the task, making them feel like a total mess mentally.

Flatow asks Nass if people who are always distracted realize their brain is changing because of it. Nass says these people often say, “When I really need to focus, I shut everything off and concentrate hard.” But sadly, they have habits that stop them from focusing well. They get distracted easily and can’t stick to what they’re supposed to be doing.

Nass found that once your brain gets used to constant distractions, it’s really hard to stop, even if you want to focus. For example, if every boring moment—like waiting in line or sitting alone—makes you check your phone, your brain changes. It becomes like the “mental wrecks” in the study, not ready for deep thinking, even if you try to practice focusing.

Rule #1 taught you how to add deep work into your day with habits to help you concentrate as much as you can now. Rule #2 will help you get even better at focusing. The next strategies are based on the idea that you need training to improve your focus and to fight off distractions. These strategies include things like cutting off distractions and practicing a special kind of meditation. Together, they give you a clear plan to go from a distracted brain to one that can focus like a laser.

Don’t take breaks from distractions. Instead, take breaks from focusing.

Many people think they can switch between being distracted and focused whenever they want, but that’s not really true. When your brain is used to distractions, it actually wants them. This strategy is made to help you train your brain to stay focused better.
