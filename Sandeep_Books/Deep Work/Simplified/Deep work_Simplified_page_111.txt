The farm doesn’t sell its steaks through big stores like Whole Foods. Instead, it sells directly to customers at busy farmers’ markets around Washington, D.C. From what people say, the farm is doing really well, even though small farms usually have a hard time.

I first met Pritchard at our local farmers’ market in Takoma Park, Maryland. The Smith Meadows booth there is popular. Pritchard is usually taller than most of his customers and wears a worn-out flannel shirt, like a typical farmer. He seems very confident in his skills. I talked to him because farming takes good tool management, and I wanted to learn how someone who works with their hands thinks about using tools.

“Haymaking is a good example,” he said early in our talk. “I can explain it without ignoring the money side of things.” When Pritchard took over Smith Meadows, the farm made its own hay to feed the animals in winter when they couldn’t graze outside.

Haymaking uses a machine called a hay baler. It’s pulled behind a tractor and packs dried grass into bales. If you raise animals on the East Coast, you’d think it makes sense to own a hay baler because animals need hay. Why buy hay when you can grow your own grass? If a farmer thought like an office worker, they would definitely buy a hay baler.

But Pritchard told me (after joking a bit) that if a farmer thought that way, “I’d be waiting for the day I have to sell the farm.” Instead, he thinks more carefully when deciding about tools. After thinking it over, he sold the hay baler and now buys all the hay the farm needs.

Here’s why. “Let’s look at the costs of making hay,” Pritchard said. “There’s fuel, repairs, and the shed to store the baler. Plus, you pay taxes on it.” These costs were easy to figure out. The harder part was the “opportunity costs.” He explained, “If I spend all summer making hay, I’m not doing other things. Now, I use that time to raise chickens for meat. That makes money because I can sell them.”
