First, your time guesses will probably be wrong. For example, you might think writing a press release will take two hours, but it actually takes two and a half hours. Second, you’ll get interrupted or have new things to do that pop up unexpectedly. These things will mess up your schedule.

That’s okay. If your schedule gets messed up, take a few minutes as soon as you can to make a new plan for the rest of the day. You can start a new page, erase and redraw your blocks of time, or do what I do: cross out the old blocks and make new ones next to them on the page (I make my blocks skinny so I have space to do this). Some days, you might have to rewrite your schedule six times. Don’t worry if that happens. Your goal isn’t to stick to the first plan no matter what; it’s to keep control of how you spend your time, even if you have to change your plans a lot during the day.

If you feel like you’re changing your schedule too much, here are some tips to help. First, know that you’ll probably underestimate how long things take at first. When people start planning their day, they often hope everything will go perfectly. Over time, try to guess how long tasks really take, or even a bit longer to be safe.

Second, use extra “overflow” time blocks. If you don’t know how long something will take, block off the expected time, and then add another block after it that can be used for either finishing the task or doing something else if you finish early. For example, if you schedule two hours to write a press release, add one more hour after that. If you need more time, keep working on the press release. If not, use that hour to catch up on emails.

Third, use lots of task blocks throughout your day and make them longer than you think you need. Stuff always comes up during the day, so having extra time blocks helps you handle surprises without messing up your whole schedule.
