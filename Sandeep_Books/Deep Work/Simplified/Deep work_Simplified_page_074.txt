The cabins aren’t valuable because of their fancy features. Instead, they show a big commitment to helping people write better by being designed just for that purpose.

But not every big commitment has to last forever. William Shockley, a super competitive scientist at Bell Labs, missed out on inventing the transistor because two of his team members did it while he was busy with something else. After that, he locked himself in a hotel room in Chicago—where he had gone for a conference—and didn’t come out until he figured out a better design he had been thinking about. When he finally left, he sent his notes back to his lab to make sure the idea was officially recorded. This new version of the transistor he worked out helped him win part of the Nobel Prize later on.

An even crazier example comes from Peter Shankman, an entrepreneur who spends a lot of time flying. He realized that being 30,000 feet in the air was the best place for him to focus because there were no distractions. When he got a book contract with only two weeks to finish the whole thing, he needed to concentrate hard. So, he did something unusual: he bought a business-class round-trip ticket to Tokyo. He wrote the whole flight there, had an espresso in the lounge, then wrote the whole flight back, finishing the book in just 30 hours. The trip cost $4,000, but he said it was totally worth it.

In all these stories, it’s not just about being somewhere quiet or different. The main thing is the mental commitment to the task. Going to a special place to focus, taking time off just to think, or locking yourself away until you finish something important—these actions show how serious you are. That seriousness helps your brain focus better. Sometimes, to really dive deep into a project, you have to make a big move first.
