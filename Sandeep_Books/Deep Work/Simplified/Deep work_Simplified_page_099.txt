The Bulletin of the Nuttall Ornithological Club—a magazine that takes bird books really seriously—liked Roosevelt’s work a lot. Because of this, Morris said that Roosevelt was “one of the most knowledgeable young naturalists in the United States” even when he was young. But to spend so much time on his hobbies, Roosevelt had to cut back on the time for his main job: studying at Harvard. Morris looked at Roosevelt’s diary and letters and guessed that he spent only about a quarter of his day studying.

You might think Roosevelt’s grades would be bad because of this. But they weren’t. He wasn’t the best student, but he didn’t do badly either. In his first year, he got good grades in five out of seven classes. The reason for this was how Roosevelt managed his schoolwork. He planned his day from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., then took away the time for classes, sports training (which was once a day), and lunch. The leftover time was for studying only.

Even though this leftover time wasn’t very long, Roosevelt made the most of it by focusing really hard. Morris said, “He didn’t spend a lot of time at his desk, but he concentrated so much and read so fast that he could take more breaks than most students.” You can try this too by adding some of Roosevelt’s intense focus to your work. Pick one important task that needs deep thinking. Think about how long you usually spend on it, then give yourself a much shorter deadline.

If you can, tell someone else this new deadline so you feel more committed. If that’s not possible or might cause problems, set a timer on your phone and put it where you can always see it while you work.

Now, the only way to finish this task on time is to work super hard—no checking email, no daydreaming, no scrolling on Facebook, no extra coffee breaks. Like Roosevelt at Harvard, focus all your brain power on the task until it’s done.
