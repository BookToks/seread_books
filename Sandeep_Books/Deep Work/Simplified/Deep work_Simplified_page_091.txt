Shutdown rituals can be annoying because they add another ten to fifteen minutes to the end of your workday, sometimes even longer. But they are important if you want to get the benefits of taking regular breaks from work.

In my experience, it takes about a week or two before the shutdown habit really sticks. That means your mind starts to trust the routine enough to let go of work thoughts in the evening. Once it becomes a habit, the ritual will be part of your life, and skipping it will make you feel uncomfortable.

Many studies in psychology show that resting your brain regularly helps you do better deep work. When you work, work hard. When you’re done, stop working. You might reply to emails a bit slower, but you’ll make up for it by getting way more important work done because your brain is fresh and ready to focus better than tired people.
