Try this experiment only once a week at first—this lets your brain practice focusing hard but also gives it time to rest and lowers your stress. When you feel good about trading focus for finishing tasks faster, try doing these Roosevelt dashes more often. But always set your deadlines just barely possible to meet. You should usually finish before time runs out (or get really close), but it should take serious concentration.

The reason for this is simple. Deep work needs way more focus than most people are used to.

Roosevelt dashes use fake deadlines to help you slowly get better at focusing. It’s like training your brain’s attention like an athlete trains their muscles. Another plus is you can’t get distracted during these dashes because you have to finish on time. So, every time you finish, you practiced ignoring boredom and the urge to look for something more exciting.

Like the last strategy said, the more you practice ignoring these urges, the easier it gets.

After doing this for a few months, your idea of focus will change a lot because you’ll be able to concentrate harder than ever before. And if you’re like a young Roosevelt, you can use the extra free time you get to enjoy cool things, like impressing people who know a lot about birds.

During the two years I was a postdoc at MIT, my wife and I lived in a small but nice apartment on Pinckney Street in historic Beacon Hill. Even though I worked in Cambridge and lived in Boston, the two places were close—only a mile apart across the Charles River. To stay fit during the long, dark New England winter, I decided to walk as much as possible between home and work.

In the morning, I walked to campus, crossing the Longfellow Bridge no matter the weather (the city was often slow to clear snow from the sidewalks). Around lunch, I changed into running clothes and ran back home on a longer path along the Charles River, crossing the Massachusetts Avenue Bridge.
