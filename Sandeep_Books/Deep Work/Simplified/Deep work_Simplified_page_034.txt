He then looked at these numbers together with how fast employees typed, read, and how much they earned. He found out that Atlantic Media was spending more than a million dollars each year just to pay people to handle emails. Every email sent or received cost the company about ninety-five cents in work time. “A ‘free and easy’ way to communicate,” Cochran said, “actually cost as much as buying a small company jet.” Tom Cochran’s test showed how much a simple habit like emailing can really cost. But the most important part of this story is the experiment itself, and how complicated it was. It’s actually really hard to answer a simple question like: How do our email habits affect the company’s money? Cochran had to do a company-wide survey and collect data from the IT system. He also needed salary info and how fast people type and read, then used a statistical model to get his final answer. Even then, the result wasn’t exact because it couldn’t tell how much good work came from all those emails to balance out the cost.

This example shows what happens with most habits that either help or hurt deep work. Even though we know distractions cost us and focusing deeply is valuable, it’s hard to measure exactly how much. This isn’t just true for distractions and deep work: As jobs get more complicated, it becomes harder to figure out how much one person’s work is really worth. The French economist Thomas Piketty talked about this when he studied why some bosses get paid way more than others. His main idea is that “it’s really hard to measure what each person actually contributes to a company.” Without clear numbers, weird things can happen, like some bosses getting paid way more than the value they bring. Some parts of Piketty’s theory are debated, but most agree that it’s true it’s harder and harder to measure individual work. So, we shouldn’t expect to easily see how much bad habits like constant distractions hurt the bottom line. Like Cochran found, these things fall into what I call a “metric black hole” — a place where measurements just don’t work well.

But just because it’s hard to measure deep work doesn’t mean companies ignore it. There are lots of things that are hard to measure but still happen a lot in business. For example, the trends mentioned at the start of this chapter, or the huge salaries that confused Thomas Piketty.
