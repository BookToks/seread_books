In general, having fewer distractions in my life lowers the constant nervous energy that many people feel every day. I’m okay with being bored, and this can be a useful skill—especially on a slow summer night in D.C. when I’m listening to a Nationals game on the radio.

This book is my way of explaining why I prefer deep, focused work over shallow, easy tasks. I also share the strategies that help me do this. I wrote it partly to help you build your life around deep work, but that’s not the whole reason. I also want to improve my own habits. Understanding the idea of deep work has helped me succeed, but I know I can still do better. As you try out the ideas and rules in this book and succeed, know that I’m doing the same—cutting out shallow work and working hard to get deeper. (You’ll find out how I do in the end of the book.)

When Carl Jung wanted to change psychiatry, he built a quiet retreat in the woods. His Bollingen Tower was a place where he could think deeply and create amazing work that changed the world. In this book, I’ll try to convince you to build your own version of a Bollingen Tower—to develop the skill to create real value in a world full of distractions. The most successful people from the past believed this: living a deep life is a good life.
