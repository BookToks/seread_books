But they also make manure that I can use to improve my soil. Then there’s the tricky part of figuring out the extra value of buying a bale of hay. As Pritchard said, “When I buy hay, I’m not just spending money on food for my animals, but also on manure (after the animals eat it), which gives more nutrients to my land. I’m also avoiding damaging the soil by not driving heavy machines over it all summer.”

When deciding about the baler, Pritchard looked past the money cost, which was about the same either way, and thought more about the long-term health of his fields. Because of this, he decided that buying hay led to healthier fields. He summed it up by saying, “Soil fertility is my main priority.” So, he chose to get rid of the baler.

Look at how complicated Pritchard’s choice about tools was. This shows something important: just finding one good reason to buy a tool isn’t enough for people like him. Sure, a hay baler has its good points—every farm tool does.

But it also has downsides. Pritchard knew this decision wouldn’t be simple. He started with a clear main goal—in his case, that keeping the soil healthy is super important for his work—and then used that to decide if a tool was worth using.

I think if you work with ideas—especially if you want to focus deeply—you should pick your tools as carefully as skilled workers like farmers do. Here’s my idea for how to do this. I call it the craftsman approach to choosing tools because it reminds us that tools should help us reach the big goals in our work.

The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection: Figure out what really matters for your success and happiness in work and life. Use a tool only if its good effects on these things are much bigger than its bad effects.

Notice that this craftsman approach is different from the any-benefit approach. The any-benefit way says any small good thing is enough to use a tool, but the craftsman way says those good things must affect what’s really important to you and be stronger than the bad things.

Even though the craftsman approach isn’t as simple as the any-benefit one, it doesn’t ignore the reasons people like network tools or say what’s “good” or “bad” technology. It just asks you to think about any tool carefully, like skilled workers have always done when choosing their tools.
