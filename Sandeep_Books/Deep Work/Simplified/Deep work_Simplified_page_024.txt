If you’re trying to learn something really hard, like managing SQL databases, but you’re not paying full attention (maybe you have Facebook open too), your brain gets confused. It’s trying to do too many things at once, so it can’t focus on the part you actually need to learn.

A long time ago, a guy named Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges said you should use your mind like a lens to focus your attention. Now, scientists explain this with brain cells called oligodendrocytes. The important idea is this: to learn hard stuff fast, you have to focus deeply without distractions. Learning means doing deep work. If you’re good at focusing deeply, you’ll be able to learn complicated skills that help you succeed in today’s world. But if you get distracted a lot and don’t like focusing, these skills will be much harder for you.

Deep work helps you do amazing things. Adam Grant is a good example. When I met him in 2013, he was the youngest professor to get tenure at Wharton School of Business. A year later, he became the youngest full professor there.

Grant got ahead fast because he works really hard and produces a lot. In 2012, he published seven articles in big journals, which is a lot for his field since most professors don’t have big teams to help them. In 2013, he published five articles, which is still a lot, but fewer than before. That year, he also wrote a book called Give and Take, which became very popular. It was even on the cover of the New York Times Magazine and sold really well. By 2014, when he became a full professor, he had written over sixty research papers and a bestselling book.
