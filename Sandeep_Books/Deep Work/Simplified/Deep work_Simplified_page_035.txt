If a business doesn’t have clear ways to measure success, its actions can easily change based on random choices and outside pressures. In this kind of messy situation, deep work—focusing without distractions—usually struggles the most.

This problem of not having good measurements is what this chapter is about. I’ll explain different ways of thinking and habits that have made businesses avoid deep work and choose more distracting activities instead. These habits wouldn’t last if people knew for sure they were hurting the company’s profits, but because there’s no clear data, distractions keep taking over in many workplaces.

One big reason for distracting habits at work is the culture of always being connected. People are expected to check and answer emails fast. A Harvard professor, Leslie Perlow, found that workers often spend 20 to 25 hours a week outside of work just checking emails because they think it’s important to reply within an hour.

Some say this quick email response is needed in busy jobs. But Perlow wanted to test if being always connected really helps. She worked with a team at a busy consulting company and made them take one day a week completely offline—no emails or messages at all.

At first, the team didn’t like this idea. The leader worried about telling clients, and the workers were scared it might hurt their jobs. But nothing bad happened. The team didn’t lose clients or their jobs. Instead, they enjoyed work more, communicated better, learned more, and gave clients better results.
