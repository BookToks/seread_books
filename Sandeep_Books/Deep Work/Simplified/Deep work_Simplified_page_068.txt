For many bosses, the rule is that you can focus as much as you want, as long as you still answer their emails quickly. This is probably why many people who do deep work in regular office jobs follow a steady, regular schedule.

In the 1980s, a journalist named Walter Isaacson was in his thirties and doing really well at Time magazine. People who thought a lot about important stuff knew who he was. For example, Christopher Hitchens, writing for the London Review of Books, called him "one of the best magazine journalists in America." At that time, Isaacson wanted to write a big, important book—a must-do for journalists who want to get ahead. He picked a tough topic: a story about six people who helped shape early Cold War politics. He worked with another young Time editor, Evan Thomas, to write a long, detailed book called The Wise Men: Six Friends and the World They Made.

The book came out in 1986 and the right people liked it.

The New York Times said it was “a richly textured account,” and the San Francisco Chronicle praised the two writers for making a Cold War story that felt like a classic biography. Less than ten years later, Isaacson reached the top of his journalism career by becoming the editor of Time. Later, he became the CEO of a think tank and wrote popular biographies about Benjamin Franklin, Albert Einstein, and Steve Jobs.

What I find interesting about Isaacson isn’t just what he achieved with his first book, but how he wrote it. I learned about this from a lucky personal connection. Before The Wise Men was published, my uncle John Paul Newport, who was also a New York journalist, shared a summer beach house with Isaacson. My uncle still remembers Isaacson’s amazing work habits: Isaacson would go up to the bedroom to work on his book while the rest of them hung out outside. He’d work for twenty minutes or an hour, typing away, then come back down feeling just as relaxed as everyone else. The work didn’t stress him out; he just happily worked whenever he had free time.
