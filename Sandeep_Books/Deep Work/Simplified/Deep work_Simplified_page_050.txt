“I’ll pick what’s important to me carefully… then pay full attention to it. Basically, I’ll live a focused life, because that’s the best way to live.” We should try to do the same.

Here’s a psychological reason why focusing deeply makes life meaningful. One famous psychologist, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, worked on this in the early 1980s with a young researcher named Reed Larson at the University of Chicago.

Back then, it was hard to figure out how different activities really made people feel. If you asked someone later how they felt hours ago, they probably wouldn’t remember. If you gave them a diary to write down their feelings all day, they might stop doing it because it’s too much work.

Csikszentmihalyi and Larson came up with a smart idea using new technology at the time. They gave people pagers that beeped randomly during the day. When the pager beeped, people had to write down what they were doing and how they felt right then. Sometimes they used a journal, other times they called someone to answer questions.

Because the beeps were random but hard to ignore, people usually did it. And because they recorded their feelings right away, their answers were more accurate. They called this the experience sampling method (ESM), and it gave new understanding about how we feel during daily life.

One big discovery from this work was that the best moments happen when you’re fully involved in something challenging but worth doing. Csikszentmihalyi called this feeling “flow,” which he explained more in a 1990 book.

This idea was different from what most people thought. Many believe that relaxing and doing less work makes them happy. But flow shows that pushing yourself in a focused way can bring more joy.
