Here’s the thing: This is okay. Tim Ferriss, a writer, once said, “Get used to letting small bad things happen. If you don’t, you’ll never have time for the big important stuff.” It should make you feel better to know that, as some smart people at MIT found out, people quickly get used to how you communicate. The fact that you didn’t answer their quick messages probably isn’t a big deal to them.

Once you stop feeling awkward about this way of doing things, you’ll start to see the benefits. There are two common ideas people talk about when trying to fix email overload. One says that sending emails just causes more emails to come in. The other says that dealing with confusing or unimportant emails is a big cause of stress. The method here fights both problems—you send fewer emails and ignore the ones that are hard to deal with—and by doing this, your inbox won’t control your time and attention as much.
