After Malcolm Gladwell made the idea of deliberate practice popular in his 2008 book, Outliers: The Story of Success, many psychologists started to question it. These experts usually don’t trust Gladwell’s ideas right away and tried to find problems with the deliberate practice theory.

But most of these studies didn’t prove that deliberate practice isn’t important. Instead, they tried to find other things that also help people become experts.

In a 2013 article called “Why Expert Performance Is Special and Cannot Be Extrapolated from Studies of Performance in the General Population,” published in the journal Intelligence, Ericsson responded to these critics. He said that many of their experiments were flawed because they wrongly assumed you could compare the gap between average and above average people to the gap between experts and beginners.
