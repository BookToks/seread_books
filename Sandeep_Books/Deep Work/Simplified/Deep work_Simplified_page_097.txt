Point #2: No matter how you plan your Internet time, you have to keep the time outside those blocks completely free from using the Internet.

This sounds easy, but it gets tricky during a busy workday. Sometimes, while you’re offline, you might suddenly realize you need some important info from the Internet to keep working. If your next Internet block is far away, you might get stuck. It’s tempting to just quickly check online and then go back offline. But you have to resist this! The Internet is super distracting. You might think you’re just checking one important email, but then you end up looking at other “urgent” messages. If you do this too often, your brain stops seeing offline time and online time as separate, which ruins the whole point.

So, if you get stuck during offline time, don’t stop right away. If you can, switch to another offline task or just relax for a bit. If you really need to finish the current task soon, then change your schedule to start your next Internet block earlier. But don’t make it right away. Wait at least five minutes before going online. This short wait won’t slow you down much, but it helps your brain separate the feeling of wanting to go online from actually doing it.

Point #3: Planning your Internet time at home as well as at work can help you focus better.

If you’re always on your phone or laptop in the evenings and weekends, then what you do outside work might be ruining your efforts to focus during the day. Your brain doesn’t really see work and home as totally different. So, try to stick to your Internet schedule even after work is over.
