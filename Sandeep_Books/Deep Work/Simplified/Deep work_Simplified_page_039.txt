Many knowledge workers face a problem. They want to show they are useful and working hard, but they aren’t always sure what that really means. They don’t have clear proof like a growing list of achievements or fixed machines to show they’re valuable. Because of this, many are looking back to the old industrial times when productivity was easier to see.

Back then, with the assembly lines, there was something called the Efficiency Movement. Frederic Taylor, who started it, would watch workers with a stopwatch to see how fast they did their jobs. Productivity was simple to measure: how many items were made in a certain time. Today, many knowledge workers try to copy this old idea of productivity to prove they matter at work. For example, David Allen talks about “cranking widgets” to mean working productively. These workers often act very busy because they don’t have a better way to show their value. Let’s call this idea “Busyness as Proxy for Productivity.”

This means that when workers don’t know how to show they are productive, they just try to look busy by doing a lot of visible tasks. This explains why some people are always sending emails, going to meetings, quickly answering messages, or talking to everyone in the office. All these actions show they are busy and help convince themselves and others they are working hard.

This way of thinking isn’t always wrong. For some jobs, being busy like this really matters. For example, in 2013, Yahoo’s CEO Marissa Mayer stopped employees from working at home. She checked the computer logs and saw that people working remotely weren’t logging in enough during the day, so she made them come to the office to make sure they were working.
