Deep work should be really important in today’s business world. But it’s not. I’ve explained a few reasons why this happens. One is that deep work is hard, while shallow work is easier. Another is that when people don’t have clear goals at work, they end up doing lots of small, visible tasks just to look busy. Also, many people believe that anything related to the Internet is good, even if it doesn’t help us make valuable things. These problems happen because it’s hard to measure how useful deep work is or how bad it is to ignore it.

If you think deep work is important, this is bad news for most businesses because they miss out on making a lot more value. But for you, as a person, it’s actually good news. Since most people and bosses don’t focus on deep work, you have a big chance to stand out. If these trends keep going, deep work will become rare and more valuable.

Now that we know deep work isn’t broken and distractions aren’t necessary, you can keep going with confidence. The main goal here is to help you build your skill to do deep work—and get great rewards from it.
