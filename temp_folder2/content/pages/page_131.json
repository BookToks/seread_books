  "simplified_text": "Where do these weird and extreme traits come from? They might be there from the start (nature) or picked up from the people and places around us (nurture). But maybe the founders arenâ€™t as extreme as they look. Could they be making certain traits seem bigger than they really are? Or is it that everyone else is making them seem more extreme?
