  "simplified_text": "We were a payments company that was worth a lot more than all the restaurants on Castro Street, even though we had fewer employees. Starting a new South Indian restaurant is really tough if you don’t pay attention to what’s actually going on in the market. If you focus too much on small details—like thinking your naan is better because of your great-grandmother’s recipe—your restaurant might not make it.\n\nCreative jobs are similar. No screenwriter wants to admit that their new movie is just a copy of something that’s already been done. Instead, they say, “This film will mix exciting ideas in a brand new way.” Sometimes that’s true. For example, if a writer has an idea for a movie where Jay-Z plays a hacker trying to catch a shark that killed his friend, that’s definitely something new. But just like there aren’t many British restaurants in Palo Alto, maybe that’s a good thing.\n\nCompanies that aren’t monopolies try to stand out by saying they belong to a mix of smaller markets. For example, British food, restaurants, and Palo Alto all come together. On the other hand, monopolies try to hide their power by saying they cover several big markets, like search engines, mobile phones, wearable tech, and self-driving cars.\n\nWhat does a monopolist’s story look like in real life? Take a look at what Google’s chairman Eric Schmidt said during a congressional hearing in 2011: “We have a really competitive market where customers have a lot of choices.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage explains how businesses, whether restaurants or creative industries, must understand their market to succeed. It contrasts how non-monopolistic companies highlight their uniqueness while monopolies emphasize their broad market reach.",
