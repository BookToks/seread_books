  "simplified_text": "THE PEOPLE QUESTION\n\nEnergy problems are really about engineering, so you might think that smart tech people would be in charge of cleantech companies. But that’s not always true. Many of the companies that didn’t do well were led by teams that didn’t know much about technology. These business people were good at getting money and government help, but they struggled to create products that people actually wanted to buy.\n\nAt Founders Fund, we noticed this trend early on. One big clue was how the cleantech leaders dressed. They were often seen in suits and ties, which was a big warning sign. Real tech people usually wear T-shirts and jeans. So, we made a rule: we wouldn’t invest in any company whose founders dressed up for meetings. We might have still avoided bad investments if we had looked closely at each company’s technology. But our insight—never invest in a tech CEO who wears a suit—helped us figure things out much quicker. The best sales are often not obvious. There’s nothing wrong with a CEO who can sell, but if they look like a typical salesman, they probably aren’t great at sales and even worse at technology.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Many cleantech companies failed because their leaders weren't tech-savvy and focused more on sales than on creating good products. The Founders Fund learned to avoid investing in CEOs who dressed in suits, as it often signaled a lack of real tech knowledge.",
