We don’t know the details, but we can see some big ideas.  \n\nPhilosopher Nick Bostrom talks about four possible paths for humanity's future. In the past, people thought history was just a cycle of good times and bad times. Recently, some have started to believe we might actually avoid bad times forever, but we still wonder if the stability we have now will last.  \n\nUsually, we push our worries aside. Most people think that the whole world will eventually develop to a level similar to the richest countries today. In this view, the future will look a lot like our present.  \n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The future is uncertain, but philosopher Nick Bostrom suggests four possible paths for humanity. While some hope for a stable future, many believe it will resemble the current state of the richest countries.",
