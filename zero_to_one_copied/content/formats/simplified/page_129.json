If you were to draw a graph showing where everyone fits, it would look like a bell curve.\n\nSince many founders have really strong traits, you might think that if you only looked at founders, the graph would show more people with extreme traits on both ends. \n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** This passage talks about how people have different strengths and weaknesses, and how most fall in the middle.
