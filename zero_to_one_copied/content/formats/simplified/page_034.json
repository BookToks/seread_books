  "simplified_text": "The problems with trying to copy what others do might explain why people who struggle with social skills, like those with Asperger’s, are doing well in Silicon Valley today. If you don’t pick up on social hints as easily, you’re less likely to follow the crowd. If you love creating things or coding, you’re not as scared to focus on those interests and get really good at them. When you use your skills, you’re also less likely to change your beliefs to fit in, which can help you avoid getting lost in competition for obvious rewards.\n\nCompetition can make people see chances that aren’t really there. A wild example from the '90s was the fight for the online pet store market. It was Pets.com against PetStore.com against Petopia.com, and many more. Each company was so focused on beating the others because they didn’t have anything special to offer. They got caught up in silly questions like who could sell dog toys cheaper or who could make the best Super Bowl ads. They totally forgot to ask if the online pet supply market was even a good place to be. Winning is great, but everyone loses when the fight isn’t worth it. When Pets.com went under after the dot-com crash, $300 million in investments vanished with it.\n\nSometimes, competition can just be strange and distracting. Take the rivalry between Larry Ellison, the co-founder and CEO of Oracle, and Tom Siebel, a top salesman at Oracle who later started his own company, Siebel Systems. Ellison was furious with Siebel for leaving, and Siebel didn’t like being in Ellison’s shadow. They were very similar—both were driven Chicagoans who loved selling and hated losing—so their anger ran deep. They spent the late '90s trying to sabotage each other. At one point, Ellison even sent tons of ice cream sandwiches to Siebel’s office to lure his employees away. The wrappers said, “Summer is near. Oracle is here. To brighten your day and your career.”\n\nOddly, Oracle seemed to want enemies. Ellison believed it was good to have a rival, as long as that rival was big enough to motivate employees but not so big that it could actually hurt the company. So, he was probably happy when a small database company called Informix put up a billboard near Oracle’s headquarters that said, “CAUTION: DINOSAUR CROSSING.” Another Informix billboard on the highway said, “YOU’VE JUST PASSED REDWOOD SHORES. SO DID WE.” Oracle responded with a billboard that suggested Informix’s software was slower than snails.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how people with social challenges can thrive in Silicon Valley by focusing on their interests without getting caught up in competition. It highlights the absurdity of rivalries in business, using examples like the online pet store wars and the conflict between Oracle's Larry Ellison and Tom Siebel. Competition can distract from what really matters and lead to losses.",
