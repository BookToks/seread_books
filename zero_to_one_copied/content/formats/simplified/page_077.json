  "simplified_text": "WHAT TO DO WITH SECRETS\n\nWhen you find out a secret, you have to decide: Do you share it with someone or keep it to yourself? \n\nIt really depends on the secret. Some secrets can be risky. As Faust says to Wagner, people who show their true feelings often get hurt. If your beliefs are different from what most people think, it’s usually not smart to tell everyone everything you know. \n\nSo, who should you tell? Only the people you really need to, and not more. There’s a balance between telling no one and telling everyone, and that’s where a small group comes in. The best business leaders understand this: every successful company is built around a secret that outsiders don’t know. When you share your secret with someone, they become part of your team. \n\nAs Tolkien wrote in The Lord of the Rings, life is like a long journey with no clear end. The paths we take are shaped by those who came before us. But later in the story, he reminds us that there might be new paths or hidden doors waiting for us. Even if we miss them today, we might find them tomorrow and discover exciting new adventures. \n\nThe journey doesn’t have to go on forever. Sometimes, it’s worth exploring those hidden paths.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Secrets can be tricky; deciding who to share them with is important. Successful people often keep secrets within a small group. Life is a journey with many paths, and exploring hidden ones can lead to new adventures.",
