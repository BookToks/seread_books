  "simplified_text": "The main point for businesses is that we really need founders. We should be open to founders who might seem a bit weird or extreme because they can help companies grow in new ways, not just slowly improve what’s already there.\n\nFor founders, it’s important to know that being popular can quickly turn into being hated, so you have to be careful. Don’t think you’re more powerful than you really are. Founders matter not because they do everything alone, but because they can inspire everyone at their company to do their best work. We need unique founders, but that doesn’t mean we should treat them like they’re perfect superheroes who don’t need anyone else. \n\nAyn Rand, a famous writer, had some good ideas, but her heroes were unrealistic. There’s no perfect place where you can escape from society. Thinking you can do everything by yourself isn’t a sign of strength; it’s a sign that you’ve confused people’s praise or criticism for the truth. The biggest risk for a founder is to believe their own hype so much that they lose touch with reality. But another big risk for any business is to lose all hope and think that being disillusioned is the same as being wise.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Founders are crucial for businesses, and we should accept their uniqueness. However, founders must be cautious of their own popularity and not overestimate their power. They inspire others, but they shouldn’t think they can succeed alone.",
