Today, we have so much knowledge that it would be more likely for everything to be wiped out than for us to go through a long dark period and then recover. If we do face extinction, there won’t be any future for humanity to think about.\n\nIf we think of the future as a time that looks different from now, most people don’t really expect a different future. Instead, they think the next few decades will bring more globalization, where everything becomes more similar. In this idea, poorer countries will catch up to richer ones, and the whole world will reach a point where the economy levels off. But even if this global level could happen, could it last? In the best case, competition for resources would be super intense for everyone.\n\nWhen you mix competition with limited resources, it’s hard to believe that this global balance could last forever. Without new technology to ease the pressure, things could get really tense and lead to conflict. If that happens on a global scale, we could end up facing extinction.\n\nThat brings us to the fourth option, where we create new technology to build a much better future. The most extreme version of this idea is called the Singularity. This term describes a future where new technologies are so advanced that they go beyond what we currently understand. Ray Kurzweil, a well-known supporter of the Singularity, looks at trends in technology and predicts a future with super-smart artificial intelligence. He believes that “the Singularity is near,” and it’s unavoidable, so we just need to get ready for it.\n\nBut even with all these trends, the future won’t just happen by itself. What the Singularity might look like is less important than the big choice we have today: nothing or something. It’s up to us to make sure the future is better, which means we need to start working on it now.\n\nWhether we reach the Singularity on a huge scale isn’t as important as taking the chances we have to do new things in our own lives. Everything that matters to us—like the universe, the planet, our country, our jobs, and our lives—is unique.\n\nOur job today is to find special ways to create new things that will make the future not just different, but better—to go from nothing to something. The first step is to think for yourself. Only by seeing things differently can we make real changes.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses four possible futures for humanity, emphasizing the importance of creating new technology to improve our world. It highlights the need for individuals to think independently and take action today to shape a better future.",
