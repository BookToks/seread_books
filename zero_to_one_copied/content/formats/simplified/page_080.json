Before PayPal, I invested in a company that Luke started with someone else. It was his first startup and one of my first investments. We didn’t realize it at the time, but the business was set to fail from the start because Luke and his co-founder were a bad match. Luke is a creative thinker, while his co-founder was more of a business type who just wanted to cash in on the ’90s tech boom. They met at a networking event, chatted for a bit, and decided to team up. That’s like marrying the first person you meet at a casino: you might get lucky, but it’s more likely to flop. Their company failed, and I lost my money.\n\nNow, when I think about investing in a startup, I look closely at the founding teams. It’s important that they have the right skills, but it’s just as crucial that they know each other well and can work together smoothly. Founders should have a history together before starting a company; otherwise, it’s like taking a gamble.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Choosing the right co-founder is crucial for a startup's success. It's important to know each other well and work together effectively. Without a strong partnership, the company is likely to fail.",
