  "simplified_text": "THE DISTRIBUTION QUESTION\n\nCleantech companies did a great job getting attention from the government and investors, but they often forgot about the customers. They found out the hard way that selling and delivering a product is just as important as the product itself.\n\nTake the Israeli electric vehicle startup Better Place, for example. From 2007 to 2012, they raised and spent over $800 million to create battery packs that could be swapped out and charging stations for electric cars. They wanted to make a green option that would help reduce our reliance on polluting transportation. They did achieve this—sort of—by selling 1,000 cars before going bankrupt. Even selling that many was impressive since it was tough for customers to actually buy one.\n\nFirst off, it was confusing what you were really buying. Better Place took regular sedans from Renault and changed them to run on electricity. So, were you getting an electric Renault or a Better Place car? If you wanted to buy one, you had to go through a bunch of steps. First, you needed to get approval from Better Place. To do that, you had to show that you lived close to a battery swapping station and agree to stick to certain routes. If you passed that test, you then had to sign up for a subscription to recharge your car. Only after all that could you start learning how to swap out battery packs on the road.\n\nBetter Place thought their technology was so cool that they didn’t need to market it well. Looking back on the company’s failure, one unhappy customer asked, “Why wasn’t there a big ad in Tel Aviv showing a picture of a Toyota Prius for 160,000 shekels and a picture of this car, for 160,000 plus fuel for four years?” He still bought one of the cars, but he was a hobbyist who was willing to do anything to keep driving it. Sadly, he can’t anymore. As the Better Place board said when they sold the company’s assets for just $12 million in 2013, “We solved the technical problems, but we couldn’t get past the other issues.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Cleantech companies often focused on getting investors but ignored customers. Better Place, an electric vehicle startup, struggled to sell cars due to confusing buying processes and poor marketing. Despite raising a lot of money, they went bankrupt after selling only 1,000 cars.",
