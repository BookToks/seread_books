If you want to change the world, be humble. The best way to move forward is by taking small, steady steps.\n\n2. Keep it simple and flexible.  \nCompanies should be “lean,” which means not having a strict plan. You shouldn’t know exactly what your business will do. Planning too much can be arrogant and stiff. Instead, try different things, learn from them, and see what works.\n\n3. Improve what’s already out there.  \nDon’t rush to create something completely new. To know if your business is real, start with customers who already exist. Build your company by making better versions of products that are already successful.\n\n4. Focus on the product, not just selling.  \nIf your product needs a lot of ads or salespeople to sell it, it’s probably not good enough. Technology should be about making great products, not just getting them out there. The best growth happens when people share your product naturally.\n\nThese lessons are now common in the startup world, and ignoring them can lead to failure like what happened in the tech crash of 2000. But there are other ideas that might be more accurate:  \n1. It’s better to take bold risks than to play it safe.  \n2. Having a bad plan is better than having no plan at all.  \n3. Competitive markets can hurt profits.  \n4. Sales are just as important as the product itself.\n\nIt’s true that there was a tech bubble. In the late '90s, people were overly confident, thinking they could go from nothing to something great. Many startups didn’t succeed and only talked about their ideas. But we realized we needed to do more with less. The market peak in March 2000 was crazy, but it also showed us what we needed for the future. People saw how much new technology was needed and believed they could create it.\n\nWe still need new technology, and maybe we need some of that confidence from 1999 to get there. To build the next wave of companies, we should let go of the strict rules made after the crash. This doesn’t mean the opposite ideas are always right; you can’t just ignore the crowd. Instead, think about how much of what you know is based on past mistakes. The most unique thing you can do is to think for yourself.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how to succeed in business by taking small steps, staying flexible, improving existing products, and focusing on quality over sales. It argues against strict rules from past failures and encourages independent thinking for future success.",
