  "simplified_text": "The first team I built is known in Silicon Valley as the “PayPal Mafia.” This is because many of my old coworkers have helped each other start and invest in successful tech companies. We sold PayPal to eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002. Since then, Elon Musk started SpaceX and co-founded Tesla Motors. Reid Hoffman co-founded LinkedIn. Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim created YouTube together. Jeremy Stoppelman and Russel Simmons founded Yelp. David Sacks co-founded Yammer, and I co-founded Palantir. Today, all seven of these companies are worth over $1 billion each. PayPal’s office perks didn’t get much attention, but the team has done really well, both together and on their own. The culture we built was strong enough to last beyond the original company.\n\nWe didn’t create a mafia by just hiring the most talented people based on their résumés. I saw how that didn’t always work when I worked at a law firm in New York. The lawyers there ran a successful business, and they were impressive individuals, but they didn’t really connect. They spent all day together, but they didn’t seem to talk much outside of work. Why work with people who don’t even like each other? Some think it’s just part of making money, but only seeing work as a business deal is not a good idea. Since time is super valuable, it’s strange to spend it with people who don’t plan to stick together long-term. If you can’t build lasting friendships at work, you’re not using your time wisely, even if you’re making money.\n\nFrom the beginning, I wanted PayPal to be a close-knit team rather than just a group of people working together. I believed that better relationships would make us happier and more successful in our careers, even after PayPal. So, we aimed to hire people who would actually enjoy working with us. They needed to be talented, but more importantly, they had to be excited about joining our team. That was how the PayPal Mafia began.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The \"PayPal Mafia\" is a group of former PayPal employees who helped each other succeed in tech. They focused on building strong relationships rather than just hiring talent. This approach led to their success in various companies, proving that connections matter in the workplace.",
