  "simplified_text": "What if we think of Google as a tech company with many sides instead? That makes sense because, besides its search engine, Google creates lots of other software, robotic cars, Android phones, and wearable tech. But here's the catch: 95% of Google's money comes from ads in its search engine. In 2012, its other products only made $2.35 billion, and its consumer tech products made even less. Since the whole consumer tech market is worth $964 billion, Google has less than 0.24% of it, which isn’t much at all. By calling itself just another tech company, Google can avoid a lot of unwanted attention.\n\nOn the flip side, companies that aren't monopolies often say, “We’re in a league of our own.” Entrepreneurs usually downplay how much competition they really have, but that’s a big mistake for a startup. The temptation is to define your market really narrowly so that you seem to own it. For example, if you want to open a British restaurant in Palo Alto, you might think, “No one else is doing this, so we’ll dominate.” But that’s only true if you only look at British food. What if the real market is all the restaurants in Palo Alto? And what if restaurants in nearby towns count too? \n\nThese are tough questions, but the bigger issue is that you might not want to ask them. When you hear that most new restaurants fail in one or two years, you might feel the need to convince everyone that yours is different. Instead of thinking about whether your restaurant is truly special, you should consider if there are actually people in Palo Alto who really want to eat British food. It’s possible that they don’t exist.\n\nBack in 2001, my coworkers at PayPal and I often grabbed lunch on Castro Street in Mountain View. We had so many restaurant choices, like Indian, sushi, and burgers. Once we picked a type of food, we had even more options, like North Indian or South Indian, cheap or fancy, and so on. Compared to the local restaurant scene, PayPal was the only email-based payment system at that time.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Google is more than just a search engine, but most of its money comes from ads. Startups often underestimate competition, which can lead to failure. It's important to understand the real market and not just focus on being unique.",
