But cleantech companies often don’t make improvements that are 2 times better, let alone 10 times better. Sometimes, their products are even worse than what they are trying to replace. \n\nFor example, Solyndra made new cylindrical solar cells, but these cells are only about 1/π as effective as flat ones because they don’t get as much direct sunlight. The company tried to fix this by using mirrors to reflect more sunlight onto the panels, but starting with a much weaker product makes it really hard to catch up.\n\nCompanies need to aim for being 10 times better because small improvements usually don’t help the customer at all. Imagine you create a new wind turbine that is 20% more efficient than what’s already out there. That sounds great in a lab, but it doesn’t really help with the costs and risks of launching a new product in the real world. Even if your turbine is truly 20% better for the customer, people are often skeptical because they’ve heard too many exaggerated claims. Only when your product is 10 times better can you clearly show customers that it’s superior.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Tech companies need to create products that are significantly better than existing ones. Small improvements often don’t convince customers, so aiming for 10 times better is essential for success.",
