This made sense because people can replace each other in jobs. Today, some people think they hear Ross Perot’s “giant sucking sound” again, but now they blame it on computer server farms in Texas instead of low-cost factories in Tijuana. Americans are scared of technology because they see it as a repeat of past job losses due to globalization. But the two situations are different: people compete for jobs and resources, while computers don’t compete for jobs.\n\nGlobalization Means Substitution\n\nWhen Perot warned about foreign competition, both George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton talked about free trade. They said that since everyone is good at different jobs, the economy works best when people focus on what they do best and trade with each other. In reality, it’s not clear how well free trade has worked for many workers. The benefits of trade are biggest when there’s a big difference in skills, but there are a lot of workers around the world willing to do simple jobs for very low pay.\n\nPeople don’t just compete to provide labor; they also want the same resources. While American shoppers enjoy cheap toys and clothes from China, they also have to pay more for gas because many new Chinese drivers want it too. Whether people are eating shark fins in Shanghai or fish tacos in San Diego, everyone needs food and shelter. And as globalization grows, people will want even more. Now that many Chinese farmers can get enough basic food, they want more variety, like pork instead of just grain. The rich people everywhere also want the same fancy things, like Cristal champagne.\n\nTechnology Means Complementarity\n\nNow, let’s think about competition from computers instead of from other workers. Computers are really different from people, way more than any two people are different from each other. People can plan and make decisions in tricky situations, but we aren’t great at handling huge amounts of data. Computers are the opposite: they’re amazing at processing data quickly, but they struggle with simple decisions that are easy for humans.\n\nTo see how different we are, think about one of Google’s projects where a supercomputer tried to replace humans. In 2012, a supercomputer scanned 10 million YouTube thumbnails and learned to recognize a cat with 75% accuracy. That sounds cool, but a four-year-old can do it perfectly. When a cheap laptop can outsmart the best mathematicians at some tasks, but even a supercomputer can’t beat a child at others, it shows that humans and computers are not just different in power—they’re completely different.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how American workers used to worry about job competition from cheaper workers in Mexico, but now they fear technology replacing jobs. It explains the differences between human labor and computer capabilities, highlighting how globalization and technology affect job markets and resources.",
