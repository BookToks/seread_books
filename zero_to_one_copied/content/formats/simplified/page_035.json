  "simplified_text": "Then Informix CEO Phil White decided to get personal. When he found out that Larry Ellison liked Japanese samurai culture, he made a new billboard showing the Oracle logo with a broken samurai sword. This ad wasn’t really meant for Oracle or the public; it was a personal dig at Ellison. But White might have focused too much on his rival. While he was busy making billboards, Informix fell apart because of a huge accounting scandal, and White ended up in federal prison for fraud.\n\nIf you can’t beat a competitor, it might be better to join forces. I started a company called Confinity with my co-founder Max Levchin in 1998. When we launched PayPal in late 1999, Elon Musk’s X.com was right behind us. Our offices were just four blocks apart, and X’s product was almost exactly like ours. By late 1999, we were in a fierce battle. Many of us at PayPal worked 100-hour weeks. This wasn’t very productive, but we were more focused on beating X.com than on getting things done. One of our engineers even designed a bomb to help us win, but when he showed it in a meeting, everyone realized it was just a crazy idea from being super tired.\n\nIn February 2000, Elon and I were more worried about the growing tech bubble than about each other. A financial crash could ruin us both before we could finish our fight. So in early March, we met at a café halfway between our offices and agreed to merge our companies 50-50. It wasn’t easy to stop the rivalry after merging, but it was a good problem to have. As a united team, we managed to survive the dot-com crash and build a successful business.\n\nSometimes you have to fight. When that happens, you should fight to win. There’s no middle ground: either don’t fight at all or hit hard and finish it quickly. This advice can be tough to follow because pride can get in the way. Shakespeare’s Hamlet talks about how people will fight for things that don’t really matter just to protect their honor. True heroes will stand up for their honor, even if it’s for something small. This way of thinking can be harmful in business. If you see competition as a bad thing instead of something valuable, you’re already ahead of the game. The next chapter will explain how to stay focused and build a monopoly business.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Phil White, CEO of Informix, got personal with a billboard aimed at rival Larry Ellison, but his company fell apart due to a scandal. Meanwhile, I co-founded Confinity, which merged with Elon Musk’s X.com to survive the tech crash. The passage highlights the importance of recognizing competition and staying focused in business.",
