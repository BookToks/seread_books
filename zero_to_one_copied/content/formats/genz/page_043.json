  "simplified_text": "BUILDING A MONOPOLY\n\nA monopoly is when one company controls a big part of a market. To create one, you need to pick your market wisely and grow step by step.\n\nStart Small and Monopolize\n\nEvery new business starts off small, and every monopoly takes over a large part of its market. So, new businesses should begin with a really small market. It’s better to start too small than too big. The reason is simple: it’s easier to be the best in a small market than in a huge one. If you think your first market is too big, it probably is.\n\nStarting small doesn’t mean you have no customers. We learned this lesson at PayPal. Our first product let people send money using PalmPilots. It was cool tech, but there weren’t enough PalmPilot users in one place, and they didn’t use them often. So, nobody wanted our product, and we had no customers.\n\nAfter that, we focused on eBay auctions, where we found our first success. Back in late 1999, eBay had a few thousand top sellers, and after just three months of hard work, we were helping 25% of them. It was way easier to reach a few thousand people who really needed our product than to compete for attention from millions of random people.\n\nThe best market for a new business is a small group of specific people who are close together and have few or no competitors. Big markets are usually a bad idea, especially if there are already other companies in them. It’s a warning sign when entrepreneurs talk about getting just 1% of a $100 billion market. In reality, a big market is either hard to start in or has a lot of competition, making it tough to get that 1%. Even if you do manage to get a small piece, you’ll just be trying to survive because the competition will eat up your profits.\n\nScaling Up\n\nOnce you take over a small market, you can slowly move into related and bigger markets. Amazon is a great example of this. Jeff Bezos wanted to control all online shopping, but he started with books. There were tons of books to sell, they were easy to ship, and even the rare ones attracted excited customers. Amazon became the go-to place for people far from bookstores or looking for something special. \n\nThen, Amazon had two choices: get more people to read books or expand into similar markets. They chose to expand, starting with CDs, videos, and software. Amazon kept adding new categories until it became the world’s one-stop shop. The name “Amazon” reflects this idea, starting with books and now representing everything you can buy.\n\neBay also began by dominating small niche markets. When it launched its auction marketplace, it focused on specific groups before growing bigger.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To build a monopoly, start with a small market where you can easily succeed. Once you dominate that niche, gradually expand into related areas. Companies like Amazon and eBay show how starting small can lead to big success.",
