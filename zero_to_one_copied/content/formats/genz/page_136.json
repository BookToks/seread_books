For example, Elvis Presley was known as the king of rock, Michael Jackson was the king of pop, and Britney Spears was called the pop princess. \n\nBut things didn’t always go well for them. Elvis had a tough time in the ’70s and died alone, overweight, sitting on his toilet. Now, the people who impersonate him don’t look cool like he did. Michael Jackson went from being a loved child star to someone who struggled with drugs and looked very different from his younger self. People were really interested in his problems. \n\nBritney’s story is the craziest of all. We made her a superstar when she was just a teenager. But then things went wrong: she shaved her head, had issues with eating, and faced a big court case about her kids. Was she always a little off? Did the fame mess with her mind? Or did she act out to get more attention?\n\nFor some stars, dying can make them even more famous. Many musicians have died at age 27, like Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, and Kurt Cobain. This group is known as the “27 Club.” Before she died in 2011, Amy Winehouse sang about refusing rehab, saying, “They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said, ‘No, no, no.’” Maybe rehab didn’t seem appealing to her because of all the pressure.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Celebrities are often treated like royalty in America, but many face serious struggles. Stars like Elvis, Michael Jackson, and Britney Spears had dramatic falls from grace. Some even become more famous after their deaths, like those in the \"27 Club.\"",
