They believed there were strict limits to what people could achieve, and the main question was how to deal with our sad fate. But in modern times, philosophers have been more hopeful. Thinkers like Herbert Spencer on the right, Hegel in the middle, and Marx on the left all believed in progress. They thought that advancements in technology and society would make life better for everyone.\n\nIn the late 20th century, new ideas became popular. Two important political thinkers, John Rawls and Robert Nozick, are often seen as opposites. Rawls, from the left, cared about fairness and how resources are shared, while Nozick, from the right, focused on individual freedom. Both believed people could live together peacefully, so they were more optimistic than the ancient philosophers. However, unlike Spencer or Marx, Rawls and Nozick didn’t have a clear idea of what the future should look like.\n\nTheir uncertainty showed in different ways. Rawls started his book, A Theory of Justice, with the idea of a “veil of ignorance.” He thought that fair political decisions couldn’t happen if people knew too much about the real world. Instead of trying to change our actual world with its unique people and technologies, Rawls imagined a perfect society that was fair but not very dynamic. Nozick disagreed with Rawls’s idea of justice being based on a pattern. He believed that any voluntary exchange should be allowed, and no social system could be good enough to justify forcing people to follow it.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how political philosophy has evolved from ancient pessimism to modern optimism, highlighting thinkers like Rawls and Nozick. While they believed in progress and peaceful coexistence, they lacked a clear vision for the future, focusing instead on fairness and individual freedom.",
