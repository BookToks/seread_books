Plus, the founder is still running the company, so they won’t slow down anytime soon.\n\nTesla understood that style matters when it comes to green technology. Wealthy people wanted to look “green,” even if it meant driving cars like the boxy Prius or the clunky Honda Insight. Those cars only seemed cool because famous eco-friendly celebrities drove them. So, Tesla decided to make cars that were just cool on their own. For example, Leonardo DiCaprio switched from his Prius to a fancy Tesla Roadster. While other green companies struggled to stand out, Tesla created a unique brand by showing that being eco-friendly was more about social status than just saving the environment.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Tesla is becoming more popular because of its strong brand and the founder's leadership. They realized that looking cool matters in green tech, so they made stylish cars that attract attention, unlike other companies.",
