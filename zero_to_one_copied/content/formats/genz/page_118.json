  "simplified_text": "What if the right focus isn’t just on solar energy, but on all types of renewable energy? \n\nRight now, the total power we can get from renewable sources is 420 gigawatts worldwide. That means your small 100 megawatts is only 0.02% of that. When you look at the entire global power generation, which is 15,000 gigawatts, your 100 megawatts is basically nothing.\n\nMany people starting clean technology businesses are really confused about the market. They try to make their market seem smaller to stand out, but then they want to be valued like they’re part of a huge, profitable market. The problem is, you can’t be a leader in a made-up market, and big markets are super competitive, not easy to win. A lot of these clean tech founders would have been better off just opening a new British restaurant in downtown Palo Alto.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how focusing on all renewable energy is better than just solar. It highlights the confusion among clean tech entrepreneurs about market size and competition, suggesting they might be better off with simpler business ideas.",
