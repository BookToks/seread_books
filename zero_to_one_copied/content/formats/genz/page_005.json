And the next Mark Zuckerberg won't start another social network. If you're just copying these people, you're not really learning from them.\n\nSure, it's easier to copy what others have done than to come up with something new. When we do what we already know, we’re just adding more of what’s familiar. But every time we create something new, we go from 0 to 1. Creating is special, and so is the moment when something new is made. \n\nIf American companies don’t focus on creating new things, they will struggle in the future, even if they’re making a lot of money right now. What happens when we’ve done everything we can with the old ways of doing business? It might sound unlikely, but the answer could be worse than the 2008 crisis. Following today’s “best practices” can lead to dead ends; the best paths are often new and unexplored.\n\nIn a world filled with huge organizations, looking for a new way might feel impossible. But if American businesses want to succeed, we’ll need many breakthroughs. This might sound depressing, but there’s one important fact: humans are different from other species because we can create amazing things. We call these amazing things technology.\n\nTechnology is incredible because it helps us do more with less, boosting our abilities to new levels. Other animals build things like dams or hives, but we’re the only ones who can invent new things and better ways to make them. We don’t just pick what to build from a list of options; by creating new technologies, we change how the world works. These are simple truths we teach young kids, but they can be easy to forget when we often repeat what’s already been done.\n\n\"Zero to One\" is about how to create companies that make new things. It includes everything I’ve learned as a co-founder of PayPal and Palantir and as an investor in many startups, like Facebook and SpaceX. While I've noticed a lot of patterns, this book doesn’t give a step-by-step guide to success. The tricky thing about teaching entrepreneurship is that there can’t be a formula for it; every new idea is different, so no one can tell you exactly how to be innovative. The most powerful pattern I’ve seen is that successful people find value in unexpected places by thinking about business from the ground up instead of using formulas.\n\nThis book comes from a course I taught about startups at Stanford in 2012. College students can get really good at specific skills, but many don’t learn how to use those skills in the real world. My main goal in teaching the class was to help my students look beyond their academic paths and see the bigger future they can create.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** This passage discusses the importance of creating new ideas in business rather than copying existing ones. It emphasizes that true innovation leads to success and that technology allows us to achieve more. The author shares insights from his experiences and teaching, highlighting the need for fresh thinking in entrepreneurship.",
