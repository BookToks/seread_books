Power law distributions are so huge that they can be hard to notice. For example, when people outside of Silicon Valley think about venture capital, they might imagine a small, quirky group like the show Shark Tank, but without the ads. \n\nIn reality, less than 1% of new businesses started each year in the U.S. get venture funding, and total venture capital investment is only about 0.2% of the country’s economy. But the companies that do get this funding have a huge impact on the economy. Venture-backed businesses create 11% of all private sector jobs and bring in yearly revenues that make up about 21% of the GDP. In fact, the twelve biggest tech companies all received venture backing, and together, they are worth over $2 trillion, which is more than all other tech companies put together.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Venture capital is a small part of the economy, but it helps create a lot of jobs and revenue. The biggest tech companies are backed by venture funding, showing its huge impact."
