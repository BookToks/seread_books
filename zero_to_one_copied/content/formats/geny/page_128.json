  "text": "THE FOUNDER’S PARADOX\n\nOut of the six people who started PayPal, four of them built bombs in high school. Five of them were only 23 years old or younger. Four of us were born outside the U.S. Three of us came from countries with communism: Yu Pan from China, Luke Nosek from Poland, and Max Levchin from Soviet Ukraine. Building bombs wasn’t something kids usually did in those places back then.\n\nWe might have seemed a bit strange to others. My first chat with Luke was about how he signed up for cryonics, which means he wanted to be frozen when he died, hoping to come back to life later. Max said he didn’t belong to any country and was proud of it because his family got stuck in a tough situation when the USSR fell apart while they were trying to get to the U.S. Russ Simmons went from living in a trailer park to a top math and science school in Illinois. Only Ken Howery had a typical American childhood; he was the only Eagle Scout in our group. But even Ken’s friends thought he was nuts for joining us and taking a much lower salary than what a big bank offered him. So, he wasn’t exactly normal either.\n\nAre all founders weird people? Or do we just remember the unusual things about them? More importantly, what traits really matter in a founder? This chapter talks about why it can be both powerful and risky for a company to be led by someone unique instead of just a regular manager.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The founders of PayPal were a unique group, with many unusual backgrounds and experiences. This chapter explores the traits that make founders stand out and why having a distinctive leader can be both beneficial and risky for a company."
