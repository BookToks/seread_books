  "simplified_text": "ENERGY 2.0\n\nTesla's success shows that clean technology (cleantech) isn't a bad idea. The main point is clear: the world needs new energy sources. Energy is super important; it helps us eat, build homes, and make everything we need to live well. Many people around the world want to live as comfortably as Americans do today. But if we don’t create new technology, we’ll face serious energy problems as globalization grows. There just aren’t enough resources to keep doing things the old way or to share what we have to make everyone rich.\n\nCleantech gave people hope for a better energy future. However, when overly optimistic investors put money into cleantech companies without solid business plans, it led to a bubble. If you look at the value of alternative energy companies in the 2000s and compare it to the rise and fall of the NASDAQ a decade earlier, you’ll see a similar pattern. In the 1990s, everyone thought the internet would be huge, but too many internet companies had that same idea without anything else to offer. Entrepreneurs can’t succeed just by thinking big; they need to start with specific, practical plans.\n\nCleantech companies had the same issue: even though the world needs energy, only companies that provide a great solution to a specific energy problem can make money. No industry is so important that just being part of it will guarantee success. The tech bubble was much bigger than cleantech, and the crash hurt even more. But the dream of the '90s was right: people who doubted the internet's impact on things like publishing or shopping looked smart in 2001, but now they seem silly. \n\nCan new energy startups succeed after the cleantech crash, just like Web 2.0 companies did after the dot-com bust? The need for energy solutions is still real. However, a successful business must start by finding a small market and becoming the best in that area. For example, Facebook began as a service for one college before expanding to others and then the whole world. Finding small markets for energy solutions will be tough—you could try to replace diesel fuel for remote islands or create small reactors for quick use in military areas. Ironically, the challenge for the entrepreneurs who will create Energy 2.0 is to think small.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Tesla shows that clean technology is still a good idea. The world needs new energy sources, but successful companies must focus on specific solutions for small markets. Entrepreneurs should think small to find unique opportunities in the energy sector.",
