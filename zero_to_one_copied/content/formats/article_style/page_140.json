  "simplified_text": "THE RETURN OF THE KING\n\nAs Microsoft was losing its grip on the tech world, Steve Jobs came back to Apple, showing how important a company's founder can be. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates were pretty different. Jobs was more of a creative type who liked to keep things private and focused on making amazing products. Gates was a businessman who wanted to keep things open and aimed to control everything. But both of them had a unique way of pushing their companies to achieve things that no one else could.\n\nJobs was a college dropout who often walked around barefoot and didn't care much about personal hygiene. He was also the center of his own fan club. Sometimes he seemed charming, and other times he acted a bit crazy, which might have been part of his plan. However, this quirky behavior got him in trouble in 1985 when Appleâ€™s board kicked him out after he clashed with the new CEO they hired to manage the company.\n\nWhen Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he showed that creating new value in business isn't something that can just be done by following a set formula. The experienced leaders before him almost drove Apple into bankruptcy. In fact, Michael Dell famously said he would just shut Apple down and return the money to the investors. But Jobs turned things around by launching the iPod in 2001, the iPhone in 2007, and the iPad in 2010. By the time he stepped down in 2011 due to health issues, Apple had become the most valuable company in the world.\n\nApple's success was largely because of Jobs's unique vision. This shows that companies creating new tech can sometimes feel more like kingdoms led by a single ruler rather than modern organizations. A strong founder can make big decisions, inspire loyalty, and plan for the future. On the other hand, big companies run by many professionals may last longer but often focus on short-term goals.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Steve Jobs's return to Apple highlighted the importance of a founder in business. Despite being different from Bill Gates, both pushed their companies to great heights. Jobs's unique vision led to Apple's success, showing how tech companies can resemble kingdoms led by strong leaders.",
