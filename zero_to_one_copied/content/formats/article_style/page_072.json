With everyone sharing their thoughts online, there’s a lot of pressure to fit in. If you say something different or challenge popular ideas, you might get criticized or ignored. So, many people just go along with the crowd instead of exploring new ideas.\n\nFinally, there’s a focus on instant information. We have everything at our fingertips, so we think we know it all. If we can Google something, why bother digging deeper? This makes it seem like there’s nothing left to discover.\n\nSo, why do so many people think there are no secrets left? It’s partly because we’ve explored most of the world, and also because of how we learn and communicate today. We’re taught to take small steps, avoid risks, follow trends on social media, and rely on quick answers. This makes it hard to believe that there are still mysteries out there waiting to be uncovered.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Many people today think there are no secrets left because we’ve explored most of the world and rely on small steps in learning. Social media pressures us to fit in, and quick access to information makes it seem like we know everything.",
