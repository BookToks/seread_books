  "simplified_text": "HAPPY COMPANIES ARE UNIQUE\n\nThe business version of our tricky question is: what valuable company is no one creating? This question is tougher than it seems because a company can create a lot of value but still not be very valuable itself. Just creating value isn’t enough—you also need to keep some of that value for yourself.\n\nThis means that even big companies can be bad businesses. For example, U.S. airlines serve millions of passengers and create hundreds of billions of dollars in value each year. But in 2012, when the average ticket price was $178, airlines only made 37 cents for each passenger trip. In contrast, Google created less value but kept way more of it. Google made $50 billion in 2012 (compared to $160 billion for the airlines), but it kept 21% of that as profit—over 100 times more than the airlines made that year. Google is so successful that it's now worth three times more than all U.S. airlines combined.\n\nAirlines compete against each other, but Google stands out on its own. Economists use two simple ideas to explain the difference: perfect competition and monopoly. \n\n“Perfect competition” is seen as the best situation in Economics 101. In perfectly competitive markets, supply meets demand. Every company sells the same products, so they have no power to set prices. If there’s money to be made, new companies will join the market, increase supply, lower prices, and take away the profits that attracted them. If too many companies enter, they’ll lose money, some will go out of business, and prices will go back up to normal levels. In the long run, no company makes a profit in perfect competition.\n\nOn the other hand, a monopoly is when one company controls the market and can set its own prices. Since there’s no competition, it can produce at the level that maximizes its profits. To an economist, all monopolies look the same, whether they push out rivals, get a special license, or innovate to the top. In this book, we’re not talking about illegal companies or government favorites: by “monopoly,” we mean a company that’s so good at what it does that no other company can offer something similar.\n\nMy name is Sandeep Gautam\n\nGoogle is a great example of a company that went from nothing to being number one: it hasn’t faced real competition in search since the early 2000s when it pulled ahead of Microsoft and Yahoo! Many Americans believe competition is what keeps us from bad situations. However, capitalism and competition are actually opposites. Capitalism is about making money, but in perfect competition, all profits get competed away. The lesson for entrepreneurs is clear: if you want to create and keep lasting value, don’t start a business that’s just like everyone else’s.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage explains how some companies, like Google, create and keep more value than others, like airlines. It discusses the difference between perfect competition and monopoly, emphasizing that unique businesses can succeed better than those that are just like everyone else.\n\nMy name is Sandeep Gautam",
