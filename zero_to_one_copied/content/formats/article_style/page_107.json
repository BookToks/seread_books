  "text": "The big differences between humans and machines mean that working with computers gives us way more benefits than trading with other people. We don’t really trade with computers like we do with other people or things like animals or lamps. That’s important to remember: computers are just tools, not our enemies.\n\nThe differences are even clearer when we think about what we want. Unlike people in developing countries, computers don’t crave fancy food or nice houses; they just need a little bit of electricity, and they don’t even know they need it. When we create new computer tech to help us solve problems, we get all the benefits of a super-specialized trading partner without having to fight over resources. If we understand it right, technology is our way to avoid competition in a world that’s getting more connected. As computers get stronger, they won’t replace humans; they’ll work alongside us.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** This passage explains how computers are tools that help us rather than competitors. They don’t have desires like humans do, and as they improve, they will complement our work instead of replacing us. Technology helps us avoid competition in a connected world."
