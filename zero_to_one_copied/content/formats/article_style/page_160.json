In 2004, he was the first outside investor in Facebook, where he still helps out as a director. That same year, he created Palantir Technologies, a software company that helps people analyze data for things like national security and finance. He also helped fund LinkedIn, Yelp, and many other successful tech startups, often run by his former coworkers known as the “PayPal Mafia.” He is a partner at Founders Fund, a venture capital firm in Silicon Valley that has invested in companies like SpaceX and Airbnb.
