  "simplified_text": "RUTHLESS PEOPLE\n\nRunning a restaurant in a competitive place like Mountain View is tough. You have to work hard to stay in business because there are so many other restaurants just like yours. If you want to keep prices low, you can only pay your workers the minimum wage. This means you have to find ways to save money, like having Grandma help at the cash register and getting the kids to wash dishes.\n\nEven the fancy restaurants aren’t safe from this pressure. They deal with intense competition and ratings that can make chefs really stressed out. For example, a famous French chef named Bernard Loiseau once said that if he lost a Michelin star, he would kill himself. He ended up taking his life in 2003 after a different guide downgraded his restaurant, even though Michelin kept his star. The competition in the restaurant world can push people to their limits.\n\nOn the other hand, a company like Google doesn’t have to worry about competition. This gives them the chance to care more about their workers, their products, and how they affect the world. Their motto, “Don’t be evil,” is partly for marketing, but it also shows that they can think about ethics because they’re doing well financially. In business, money can be everything, especially for companies that have to compete hard. Those with a monopoly, like Google, can focus on more than just making money, while others can’t. When a business is only worried about making money today, it can’t think about the future. The only way to escape this daily struggle is to have monopoly profits.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Running a restaurant in a competitive area is really tough, pushing owners to cut costs and work hard. In contrast, companies like Google can focus on ethics and their impact on the world because they don’t face the same competition. Monopolies allow businesses to think beyond just making money.",
