  "simplified_text": "THE SECRET QUESTION\n\nEvery cleantech company thought they were doing the right thing by saying we need a cleaner world. They convinced themselves that since people wanted alternative energy, it meant there was a big chance to make money in cleantech.\n\nBy 2006, it was pretty common to be excited about solar energy. That year, President George W. Bush talked about how families could have solar roofs to make their own electricity. Investor Bill Gross said that solar energy had huge potential. Suvi Sharma, who was the CEO of a solar company called Solaria, said there was a lot of excitement around solar, but there was also real opportunity, like sunshine.\n\nHowever, jumping on this excitement led many solar panel companies, like Q-Cells, Evergreen Solar, SpectraWatt, and even Gross’s own Energy Innovations, to go from promising starts to bankruptcy really fast. Each of these companies thought they had bright futures based on ideas everyone agreed on. But successful companies often have hidden reasons for their success that others don’t see.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Cleantech companies believed that a cleaner world meant big business opportunities. While many were excited about solar energy, this rush led several companies to fail quickly. Successful companies often have unique reasons for their achievements that others overlook.",
