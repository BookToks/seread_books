  "simplified_text": "In some organizations, members only hang out with each other and ignore their families and the outside world. They do this to feel a strong sense of belonging and to learn special “truths” that regular people don’t know. We call these groups cults. From the outside, they can seem really strange, especially since some famous cults were involved in terrible things, like Jim Jones and Charles Manson.\n\nBut entrepreneurs should pay attention to these intense cultures. Is being just okay with your job a sign that you’re healthy? Is it normal to only act professional? On the other hand, you have consulting firms like Accenture, which don’t have a strong mission. Their consultants come and go from different companies without any long-term ties.\n\nYou can think of company cultures on a scale. The best startups might be seen as less extreme versions of cults. The main difference is that cults are often wrong about something important, while people at a successful startup are usually right about something that others don’t see. You won’t find these kinds of secrets from consultants, and it’s okay if your company doesn’t make sense to traditional professionals. It might be better to be called a cult—or even a mafia.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Some organizations, like cults, focus on intense dedication and belonging, while others, like consulting firms, lack a strong mission. Startups can be seen as less extreme cults, often being right about important ideas that outsiders miss.",
