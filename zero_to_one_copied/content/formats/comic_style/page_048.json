  "simplified_text": "CAN YOU CONTROL YOUR FUTURE?  \nYou can think of the future as something clear and certain, or you can see it as unclear and random. If you believe the future is clear, it makes sense to plan for it and try to shape it. But if you think the future is just random, you might stop trying to control it.  \n\nThis unclear way of thinking about the future explains a lot of the problems we see today. People often focus on following rules instead of making real plans. This is especially true for Americans. In middle school, we’re told to collect a bunch of “extracurricular activities.” In high school, students work even harder to seem like they can do everything well. By the time they get to college, they’ve spent years building a confusing list of activities to prepare for a future that is totally unknown. In the end, they’re ready for anything—but not really for anything specific.  \n\nOn the other hand, having a clear view of the future means having strong beliefs. Instead of trying to be okay at many things and calling it “well-rounded,” someone with a clear plan picks one important thing to focus on and works hard at it. Instead of blending in, they aim to be really good at something unique. This isn’t what most young people do today because everyone around them has lost faith in a clear future. You usually can’t get into a top school just by being great at one thing, unless that one thing is sports.  \n\nYou can also think about the future as either better or worse than now. Optimists look forward to the future, while pessimists worry about it. Mixing these ideas gives us four different views:  \n\nIndefinite Pessimism. Every culture has stories about how things were better in the past, and many people throughout history feel the same way.  \n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how people view the future, either as clear and certain or random and uncertain. It explains how this affects their planning and ambitions, especially among students. It contrasts those who focus on one goal with those who try to do everything, leading to confusion and a lack of direction.",
