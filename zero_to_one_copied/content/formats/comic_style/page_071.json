  "simplified_text": "WHY AREN’T PEOPLE LOOKING FOR SECRETS?\n\nMost people act like there are no secrets left to discover. A famous example of this is Ted Kaczynski, known as the Unabomber. He was a child genius who started college at Harvard when he was just 16. He later got a PhD in math and became a professor at UC Berkeley. But you probably only know him because he carried out a 17-year campaign of terror using pipe bombs against professors, tech experts, and business people.\n\nIn late 1995, no one knew who the Unabomber was or where he was hiding. The biggest clue was a 35,000-word manifesto he wrote and sent to the media anonymously. The FBI asked some big newspapers to publish it, hoping someone would recognize him. It worked: Kaczynski’s brother saw his writing style and reported him.\n\nYou might think his writing would show signs of craziness, but the manifesto was surprisingly clear. Kaczynski said that to be happy, everyone needs to have goals that require effort and succeed in achieving some of those goals. He divided human goals into three types:\n\n1. Goals that are easy to achieve.\n2. Goals that need serious effort to achieve.\n3. Goals that can’t be achieved no matter how hard you try.\n\nThis is the classic idea of easy, hard, and impossible goals. Kaczynski believed that people today are unhappy because all the tough problems have already been solved. What’s left to do is either too easy or impossible, and working on those tasks doesn’t feel fulfilling. What you can do is something even a child could do, and what you can’t do is something even a genius couldn’t manage. So, Kaczynski thought the solution was to destroy current systems, get rid of technology, and let people start fresh to tackle hard problems again.\n\nKaczynski’s actions were extreme, but his doubts about technology are everywhere. Look at the trends in urban hipster culture: old-school photography, handlebar mustaches, and vinyl records all remind us of a time when people were hopeful about the future. If it feels like everything important has already been done, some people might just pretend they don’t care about success and choose a simpler life, like working as a barista.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, believed that modern life lacks meaningful challenges. He argued that people are unhappy because all tough problems are solved, leading some to reject achievement and embrace simpler lifestyles.",
