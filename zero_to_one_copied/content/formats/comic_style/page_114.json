No matter what kind of business you want to start, a solid business plan needs to cover all of them. If you can’t answer these questions well, you might face a lot of “bad luck,” and your business could fail. If you get all seven right, you’ll likely succeed. Even getting five or six right might be enough. But during the cleantech boom, many people started companies without good answers, which meant they were just hoping for a miracle.  \n\nIt’s tough to say exactly why many cleantech companies failed because most made several big mistakes. But just one mistake can be enough to sink your business, so it’s important to look closely at what went wrong for cleantech companies.  \n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** This passage discusses key questions to consider when starting a business, like timing, team, and market position. It emphasizes that having good answers is crucial for success, as many cleantech companies failed due to poor planning and mistakes.",
