  "simplified_text": "WAR AND PEACE\n\nProfessors often downplay how competitive school can be, but business leaders love to compare business to war. MBA students carry around books by famous military strategists like Clausewitz and Sun Tzu. We use war-related words in business all the time: we hire headhunters to build a strong sales team that will help us dominate the market and make a lot of money. But really, it’s the competition that feels like war: it seems necessary and brave, but it usually ends up causing a lot of damage.\n\nSo, why do people compete? Marx and Shakespeare give us two ways to think about conflict. According to Marx, people fight because they are different. The working class fights the wealthy class because they have totally different ideas and goals, which come from their different life situations. The bigger the differences, the bigger the fights. On the other hand, Shakespeare shows that fighters often look pretty similar. It’s hard to see why they’re even fighting since they don’t have a real reason. For example, in Romeo and Juliet, both families are alike but still hate each other. As their feud goes on, they forget why they started fighting in the first place.\n\nIn business, Shakespeare’s view makes more sense. Inside a company, people get really focused on competing with others for promotions. Then, companies start obsessing over their rivals in the market. In all this drama, people forget what really matters and just focus on beating their competitors.\n\nLet’s see how Shakespeare’s idea works in real life. Imagine a story called Gates and Schmidt, based on Romeo and Juliet. Montague is Microsoft, and Capulet is Google. These two big companies, led by smart leaders, clash because they are so similar. Looking back, it seems like the conflict was bound to happen, but it could have been avoided. These companies started out doing different things. Montague created software, while Capulet built a search engine. So why fight?\n\nSurprisingly, they found plenty to argue about. When they were startups, they were fine leaving each other alone and growing on their own. But as they got bigger, they started focusing on each other. Montagues worried about Capulets, and Capulets worried about Montagues. This led to battles like Windows vs. Chrome OS, Bing vs. Google Search, and more. Just like the feud cost the Montagues and Capulets their kids, it cost Microsoft and Google their top spots. Apple came in and took over. In January 2013, Apple was worth $500 billion, while Microsoft and Google together were only worth $467 billion. Just three years earlier, Microsoft and Google were each worth more than Apple. War in business is expensive.\n\nRivalry makes us focus too much on old ideas and copy what worked before. For example, think about mobile credit card readers. In October 2010, a startup called Square launched a small, white card reader that let anyone with an iPhone accept credit cards. It was the first good option for mobile payments. Soon, other companies jumped in. A Canadian company called NetSecure made a half-moon shaped reader. Intuit created a cylindrical one. In March 2012, eBay’s PayPal released a triangle-shaped reader, poking fun at Square since three sides are simpler than four. It seems like this competition won’t stop until they run out of shapes.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how competition in business is often compared to war, using examples from companies like Microsoft and Google. It highlights how rivalry can distract from important goals and lead to costly mistakes, ultimately showing that focusing too much on competitors can harm businesses.",
