  "simplified_text": "THE MECHANICS OF MAFIA\n\nLet’s start with a fun idea: what would the perfect company culture be like? Employees should really love their jobs. They should enjoy going to work so much that they don’t even care about the clock. The office should be open and friendly, not filled with boring cubicles. It should feel like home, with beanbag chairs and Ping-Pong tables instead of just desks. Free massages, sushi chefs at work, and maybe even yoga classes would make it even better. Pets should be allowed too, so employees' dogs and cats could hang out with the office's fish as unofficial mascots.\n\nBut what’s wrong with this picture? It has some crazy perks that companies in Silicon Valley are known for, but it lacks real substance. You can’t achieve anything important just by making your office look nice or hiring someone to fix your policies. “Company culture” isn’t something separate from the company; every company is its own culture. A startup is just a group of people working together towards a goal, and a good culture is simply how that teamwork feels on the inside.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The ideal company culture should make employees love their jobs and feel at home. However, perks alone aren't enough; real culture comes from the people working together towards a common goal.",
