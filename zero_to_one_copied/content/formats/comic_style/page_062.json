  "simplified_text": "FOLLOW THE MONEY\n\nMONEY MAKES MONEY. “For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them” (Matthew 25:29). Albert Einstein once said that compound interest is “the eighth wonder of the world” and “the greatest mathematical discovery of all time.” No matter how you say it, the point is clear: don’t underestimate how quickly money can grow.\n\nActually, there’s no proof that Einstein ever said those things—the quotes are made up. But this mistake shows his point: he invested his genius, and now he still gets credit for things he never actually said.\n\nMost quotes are forgotten, but a few people like Einstein and Shakespeare are quoted all the time. This isn’t surprising because a small number of people can achieve a lot more than everyone else. In 1906, an economist named Vilfredo Pareto noticed that 20% of people owned 80% of the land in Italy. He found this pattern everywhere, like how 20% of the peas in his garden produced 80% of the peas. This clear pattern, where a few people or things stand out, is all around us in nature and society. The strongest earthquakes are way more powerful than all the smaller ones combined. The biggest cities are much larger than all the small towns put together. And big businesses make more money than millions of smaller ones. Whether Einstein said it or not, the power law—where some things are way more important than others—is a big part of our world. It shapes our lives so much that we often don’t even notice it.\n\nThis chapter explains how you can see the power law when you look at money: in venture capital, where investors try to make money from fast-growing new companies, a few companies become way more valuable than all the rest. Most businesses don’t deal with venture capital, but everyone should understand one thing that even venture capitalists find hard to grasp: we don’t live in a normal world; we live under a power law.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** This passage discusses how money can grow exponentially and highlights the power law, where a small number of people or companies achieve most of the wealth. It emphasizes that understanding this concept is crucial in today's world, especially in business and investments.",
