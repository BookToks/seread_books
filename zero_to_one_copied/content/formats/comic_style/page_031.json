  "text": "THE IDEOLOGY OF COMPETITION\n\nCreative monopoly means making new products that help everyone and allow the creator to earn money. \n\nCompetition, on the other hand, means no one makes money, everything feels the same, and everyone is just trying to survive. \n\nSo, why do people think competition is good? The truth is, competition isn’t just about money or a hassle that people and companies face in the market. It’s more like a belief system—an idea that is everywhere in our society and messes with our thinking. We talk about competition, believe we need it, and follow its rules; but in the end, the more we compete, the less we actually gain.\n\nThis is a simple fact, but we’ve all been taught to overlook it. Our schools push this obsession with competition. Grades show exactly how competitive each student is; those with the highest scores get more recognition and respect. We teach all students the same subjects in similar ways, no matter their unique skills or interests. Students who don’t learn best by sitting quietly at a desk can feel less valued, while those who do well on tests end up defining themselves by this strange academic world.\n\nIt gets even tougher as students move up in school. Top students feel confident until they reach a level of competition that can crush their dreams. College is where students with big plans in high school find themselves in tough battles with other smart students for typical jobs like management consulting and investment banking. To be part of this, students (or their families) pay huge amounts of money for tuition that keeps getting more expensive. Why are we doing this to ourselves?\n\nI wish I had thought about this when I was younger. My path was so planned that in my 8th-grade yearbook, a friend predicted I would enter Stanford as a sophomore four years later. After a typical successful college experience, I went to Stanford Law School, where I competed even harder for the usual signs of success.\n\nIn law school, the biggest goal is clear: out of thousands of graduates each year, only a few get a Supreme Court clerkship. After working for a federal appeals court for a year, I got to interview for clerkships with Justices Kennedy and Scalia. My meetings went well, and I thought if I got the clerkship, I’d be set for life. But I didn’t get it, and I was heartbroken.\n\nIn 2004, after I built and sold PayPal, I ran into an old law school friend who had helped me with my unsuccessful clerkship applications. We hadn’t talked in almost ten years. Instead of asking how I was doing, he smiled and said, “So, Peter, aren’t you glad you didn’t get that clerkship?” Looking back, we both realized that winning that competition would have made my life worse. If I had worked at the Supreme Court, I probably would have spent my career doing boring tasks instead of creating something new. It’s hard to say how different things would be, but the chances I missed were huge.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** This passage discusses how competition is often seen as beneficial but can actually limit creativity and personal growth. It highlights the pressure students face in school and how pursuing traditional success can lead to disappointment. Ultimately, it suggests that focusing on collaboration and creativity might be more rewarding."
