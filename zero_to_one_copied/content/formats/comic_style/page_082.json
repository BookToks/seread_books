  "simplified_text": "The person will own a tiny part of the company’s stock. This means he’s more likely to give himself rewards based on what he owns, not the actual value of the company. As long as he shows good results every few months, he can keep his high salary and private jet. \n\nProblems can happen even if he gets stock as a reward for making the company look good. If he gets stock for short-term success, he might find it easier to cut costs instead of investing in things that could help the company grow in the long run. \n\nIn contrast, small startups usually have founders who own and control the company. Most issues in a startup come from disagreements between the founders and the investors on the board. As time goes on, these conflicts can grow. For example, a board member might want to sell the company quickly to make a profit, while the founders might want to keep it private and develop it further. \n\nIn the boardroom, having fewer people is better. A smaller board can communicate easily, agree on decisions, and keep a close watch on the company. But this also means a small board can strongly oppose the management if there’s a disagreement. That’s why it’s super important to choose board members carefully. One bad member can cause big problems and even threaten the company’s future. \n\nA board with three members is best. You should never have more than five members unless your company is public. Public companies have to follow rules that make them have bigger boards, usually around nine members. Having a huge board can be the worst idea. When people see a nonprofit with a lot of board members, they might think it’s well-run, but a big board often doesn’t do a good job overseeing things. It just hides the fact that one person might be running everything. If you want a strong board, keep it small.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A small board is better for effective communication and decision-making in a company. Having too many board members can lead to problems and lack of oversight. It's crucial to choose board members wisely to ensure the company's success.",
