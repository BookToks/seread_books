  "simplified_text": "Being lean is a way of working, not just a goal. Making small changes to things that are already there might help you improve a little, but it won’t help you reach your full potential. For example, you could create an awesome app that lets people order toilet paper from their iPhone. But just making small updates without a big plan won’t help you grow from nothing to something great. \n\nRunning a company is a weird place for someone who always thinks positively. Why would you think your business will do well if you don’t have a solid plan to make it happen? While survival of the fittest might work in other areas, having a smart design is what really helps startups succeed.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Being lean is about working smart, not just aiming for small improvements. To truly succeed, businesses need a strong plan, not just positive thinking.",
