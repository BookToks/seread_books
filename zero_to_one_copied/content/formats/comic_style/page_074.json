If we trust today’s ideas, we might feel pretty satisfied, thinking everything is fine.\n\nFor instance, a world without secrets would mean everyone understands justice perfectly. Every unfair situation hides a truth that most people don’t see at first. In a democracy, something wrong keeps happening only if most people don’t see it as wrong. Back in the early 1800s, only a few people knew that slavery was bad. Now, everyone agrees, but back then, it was a secret. If we say there are no secrets today, it means we live in a world without hidden unfairness.\n\nIn economics, not believing in secrets makes people trust that markets work well. But financial bubbles show that markets can be really messed up. The more people believe in how well markets work, the bigger the bubbles get. In 1999, no one wanted to admit that the internet was way overpriced. The same thing happened with housing in 2005. Even the head of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, noticed some signs of trouble but thought a nationwide housing bubble was unlikely. The market seemed to show all the information we needed, so no one questioned it. Then home prices crashed, leading to the financial crisis of 2008, which lost trillions of dollars. It turned out there were many secrets that economists couldn’t just ignore.\n\nWhat happens when a company stops believing in secrets? The story of Hewlett-Packard (HP) is a warning. In 1990, HP was worth $9 billion. Then, in the 90s, they invented a lot of cool stuff. They made the first affordable color printer in 1991 and one of the first super portable laptops in 1993. By 2000, HP was worth $135 billion.\n\nBut starting in late 1999, when HP launched a new campaign to “invent,” they actually stopped coming up with new ideas. In 2001, they started HP Services, which was just a fancy consulting service. In 2002, they merged with Compaq because they didn’t know what else to do. By 2005, HP’s value dropped to $70 billion—about half of what it was just five years earlier.\n\nHP’s board was a mess: it split into two groups, and only one cared about new technology. This group was led by Tom Perkins, who had been with HP since 1963. At 73 years old in 2005, he thought the board should find new tech ideas and build them. But his group lost to the other side, led by Patricia Dunn, who believed the board should only focus on following the rules and not on future tech.\n\nDuring this fighting, someone on the board leaked info to the press. When it came out that Dunn had arranged illegal wiretaps to find out who leaked the info, the backlash was worse than the original problems, and the board lost its reputation. Instead of looking for tech secrets, HP got caught up in gossip. By late 2012, HP was worth just $23 billion—not much more than in 1990 when adjusted for inflation.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how believing in secrets can lead to misunderstandings in justice and economics, using HP's decline as an example of a company that stopped innovating and got distracted by internal conflicts and gossip.",
