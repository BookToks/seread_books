  "simplified_text": "THE RETURN OF DESIGN\n\nWhat if we focused on design instead of just luck? Nowadays, having “good design” is super important, and everyone from laid-back people to busy professionals carefully picks how they look. It’s true that every successful business person is really a designer at heart. If you’ve ever used an iPhone or a sleek MacBook, you’ve experienced Steve Jobs’s passion for making things look and feel perfect. But the biggest lesson from Jobs isn’t just about looks. The best thing he created was his business.\n\nApple had clear, long-term plans to make new products and get them out to people. Forget about just making something that works; since he started Apple in 1976, Jobs showed that you can change the world with careful planning instead of just following what others do or listening to focus groups. People often underestimate long-term planning in our fast-paced world. When the first iPod came out in October 2001, many experts thought it was just a cool add-on for Mac users and wouldn’t matter much to anyone else. But Jobs had a bigger vision for the iPod as the start of a new wave of portable devices, even if most people didn’t see it.\n\nThe power of planning helps explain why it’s hard to figure out how much private companies are worth. When a big company wants to buy a successful startup, they usually offer too much or too little. Founders only sell when they don’t have any more solid ideas for their company, which means the buyer probably overpaid. On the other hand, founders with strong plans usually won’t sell, so the offer isn’t high enough. For example, when Yahoo! wanted to buy Facebook for $1 billion in July 2006, I thought it was worth thinking about. But Mark Zuckerberg walked into the meeting and said, “This is just a formality, it won’t take long. We’re not selling.” Mark knew where he wanted to take Facebook, but Yahoo! didn’t. A business with a solid plan will always be underestimated in a world that sees the future as random.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses the importance of design and long-term planning in business, using Steve Jobs and Apple as examples. It highlights how careful planning can lead to success, while many undervalue it in a fast-paced world.",
