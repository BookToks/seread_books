you take a break from them.

My blog, Study Hacks, has grown from a few readers to hundreds of thousands each month, but getting people’s attention online is really tough. 

But now, it seems easier. 

I think one reason social media grew so fast is that it changed how we connect hard work with getting attention. Instead of working hard to create something valuable, it’s more like a trade: I’ll pay attention to you if you pay attention to me, no matter if what we say is actually good or not. 

If a blog or magazine had the same stuff that usually shows up on Facebook or Twitter, it wouldn’t get any readers. But when that same stuff is shared on social media, it gets likes and comments. The deal here is that you get attention from friends and followers, and in return, you give them attention back, even if it’s not really deserved. 

You “like” my post, and I’ll “like” yours. 

This deal makes everyone feel important without needing to put in much effort. 

If you suddenly stop using these services, you can see how much people really notice your online presence. For most people, the truth might be a bit harsh—only your closest friends and family will probably realize you’re gone. I know I sound a bit grumpy talking about this, but it’s important to think about because wanting to feel important can lead people to waste their time and focus. 

For some, taking a break for thirty days will be tough and cause problems. If you’re in college or a social media star, it might make things harder and people will notice. But for most, this break might help you see social media in a more realistic way. 

These platforms aren’t really the essential part of our connected world like they say. They’re just products made by companies that want to make money by selling your personal info and attention to advertisers. They can be fun, but in the bigger picture of your life and what you want to achieve, they’re just a light distraction among many that could pull you away from what really matters. Or maybe social media is super important to you. You won’t know for sure until you try stepping back.
