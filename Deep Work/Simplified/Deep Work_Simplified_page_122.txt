yourself. 

The blog called "Study Hacks" has grown from a few readers to hundreds of thousands each month. Getting people to notice you online is really tough work. But now, it seems easier. 

I think one reason social media became so popular is that it changed how we connect. Instead of working hard to create something valuable and getting attention for it, social media makes it more about a simple trade: I’ll pay attention to you if you pay attention to me, no matter how good or bad it is. 

For example, if a blog, magazine, or TV show had the same stuff that fills a Facebook or Twitter feed, it wouldn’t get any viewers. But when that same stuff is shared on social media, it gets likes and comments. The unspoken deal is that if you get attention from your friends, you’ll give it back, even if it’s not really deserved. You like my post, and I’ll like yours. This deal makes everyone feel important without putting in much effort. 

If you stop using these services suddenly, you can see how much people really notice you as a content creator. For most people, the truth might be a bit disappointing—only your closest friends and family will probably realize you’re gone. I know I sound a bit grumpy talking about this, but it’s important to think about how this need for attention makes people waste their time and focus. 

For some, taking a break from social media for thirty days will be hard and cause problems. If you’re in college or an online influencer, it will definitely affect you. But for most people, this break might just help you see social media in a clearer way. These platforms aren’t the essential part of our connected world like they claim to be. They’re just products made by companies that want to sell your information and attention to advertisers. They can be fun, but in the grand scheme of your life and goals, they’re just a small distraction that can pull you away from what really matters. You won’t know how important they are to you until you try stepping back.
