Sometimes, you need to focus really hard for days. Many bosses let you do this as long as you still reply to their emails quickly. This is probably why a lot of people who work in regular office jobs follow this way of working.

In the 1980s, a journalist named Walter Isaacson was climbing the ranks at Time magazine. By then, people knew who he was. Christopher Hitchens, a well-known writer, even called him one of the best magazine journalists in America. It was the perfect time for Isaacson to write an important book, which is a big deal in journalism. He picked a tough topic about six key people from the early Cold War and worked with another young editor, Evan Thomas, to create a big book called The Wise Men: Six Friends and the World They Made.

This book came out in 1986 and got great reviews. The New York Times called it a “richly textured account,” and the San Francisco Chronicle praised the authors for their work. Less than ten years later, Isaacson became the editor of Time magazine and later became the CEO of a think tank. He also wrote popular biographies about famous people like Benjamin Franklin, Albert Einstein, and Steve Jobs.

What I find interesting about Isaacson is not just what he achieved but how he wrote his first book. I have a personal connection to this story. Before The Wise Men was published, my uncle John Paul Newport, who was also a journalist, shared a beach rental with Isaacson. My uncle still remembers how hard Isaacson worked. He would go to the bedroom to write while everyone else relaxed outside. He would spend about twenty minutes to an hour typing away, then come back down looking just as relaxed as everyone else. It was like the work didn’t stress him out; he just enjoyed writing whenever he had the chance.
