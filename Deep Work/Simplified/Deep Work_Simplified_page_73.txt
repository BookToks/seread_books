write. But having a special place to work helps them focus better and feel more inspired.

Rowling chose to stay in a fancy hotel suite near Edinburgh Castle, which helped her get into the right mindset for writing. This idea is called the "grand gesture." It means making a big change in your surroundings or spending a lot of money to help you focus on important tasks. By doing this, you trick your brain into thinking the task is more important, which makes it easier to avoid procrastination and feel motivated.

For example, writing a chapter of a Harry Potter book is tough no matter where you are. But if you're paying over $1,000 a day to write in a cool hotel near a castle that looks like Hogwarts, it's easier to get started and keep going than if you were stuck in a messy home office.

Many successful people use the grand gesture strategy. Bill Gates, the former CEO of Microsoft, would take "Think Weeks" where he would escape to a cabin with books and papers. He wanted to think deeply without distractions. During one of these weeks, he realized that the Internet would be a huge deal for his company. He could have thought deeply in his office, but the change of scenery helped him concentrate better.

Alan Lightman, a physicist and writer, also uses grand gestures. Every summer, he goes to a small island in Maine to think and recharge. As of 2000, the island had no Internet or phone service. He explained that it gives him a chance to find some quiet time, which is hard to come by.

Not everyone can spend two months in Maine, but many writers, like Dan Pink and Michael Pollan, create their own special writing spaces at home. Pollan even wrote a book about building his writing cabin in the woods. These spaces arenâ€™t strictly necessary, since all you really need is a laptop and a flat surface to write on. But having a dedicated spot helps them focus and feel more inspired.
