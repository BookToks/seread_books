Soon after I met Grant, I was curious about how he gets so much done, so I asked him about it. Luckily, he was willing to share his ideas. Grant thinks a lot about how to be super productive. For example, he sent me some PowerPoint slides from a workshop he went to with other professors. The workshop was all about using data to figure out how to do academic work efficiently. The slides had cool pie charts showing how to manage time throughout the year, a flowchart for building relationships with co-authors, and a reading list with over twenty books. These business professors aren’t just lost in their books; they see productivity as a problem to solve, and Grant seems to have figured it out.

Even though Grant’s productivity relies on a lot of things, one key idea stands out: he focuses on doing tough but important work in long, uninterrupted blocks of time. He does this in different ways. For example, during the fall semester, he teaches all his classes, which lets him concentrate on teaching and being there for his students. This strategy works well since he’s the highest-rated teacher at Wharton and has won several teaching awards. After the fall, he can fully focus on research in the spring and summer without many distractions.

Grant also manages his time in smaller chunks. During a semester when he’s focused on research, he switches between times when his door is open for students and colleagues and times when he shuts himself off to concentrate on one research task. He usually breaks writing a research paper into three parts: analyzing data, writing a full draft, and editing it for publication. When he’s in one of those focused periods, which can last three or four days, he sets up an out-of-office email reply so people know he won’t respond right away. He said it sometimes confuses his colleagues because they see him in his office. But for Grant, it’s crucial to stay focused until he finishes his work.

I think Grant doesn’t work a lot more hours than other professors at top research schools, who often tend to overwork themselves. Yet, he still gets way more done than almost anyone else in his field. I believe his method of batching his work helps explain why he’s so productive. By grouping his tasks into intense, distraction-free sessions, he’s able to achieve a lot.
