Soon after I met Grant, I was curious about how he gets so much done. Luckily, he was willing to share his ideas with me. Grant thinks a lot about how to be super productive. For example, he sent me some PowerPoint slides from a workshop he went to with other professors. This workshop was all about using data to figure out how to do academic work more efficiently. The slides had cool pie charts showing how to manage time throughout the year, a flowchart for building relationships with co-authors, and a reading list with over twenty books. These business professors don’t fit the stereotype of the forgetful academic who just reads all the time and randomly comes up with good ideas. They see productivity as a problem to solve, and it looks like Adam Grant has figured it out.

Even though Grant's productivity relies on many things, one main idea stands out: he groups tough but important work into long, focused sessions. He does this in different ways. For example, during the fall semester, he focuses entirely on teaching, which helps him connect better with his students. This strategy works well since Grant is the highest-rated teacher at Wharton and has won several teaching awards. By focusing on teaching in the fall, he can dedicate his spring and summer to research without many distractions.

Grant also manages his focus on a smaller scale. During a semester when he’s doing research, he switches between times when his door is open for students and colleagues, and times when he shuts himself off to concentrate on one research task. He usually breaks down writing a scholarly paper into three parts: analyzing data, writing a draft, and editing it to make it publishable. When he’s in these focused periods, which can last three or four days, he often sets an out-of-office message on his email so people know he won’t reply right away. He mentioned that this sometimes confuses his colleagues because they see him in his office. But for Grant, it’s crucial to stay focused until he finishes his work.

I think Adam Grant doesn’t work a lot more hours than other professors at top research schools, who often tend to overwork. Yet, he still gets more done than almost anyone else in his field. I believe his method of batching work helps explain this. By concentrating his efforts into intense, distraction-free bursts, he achieves a lot.
