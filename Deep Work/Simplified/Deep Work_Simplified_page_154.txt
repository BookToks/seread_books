As this year went on, I became really focused on my work, and it surprised me how much I got done. In the same year that I wrote a book and dealt with my son’s terrible twos, I managed to double my academic work. I published nine research papers while still not working in the evenings.

I know my intense focus this year was a bit much. It was mentally tiring, so I’ll probably tone it down in the future. But this experience shows that deep work is way more powerful than most people think. It’s this commitment to focus that helped Bill Gates create a whole new industry and helped me get so much done while writing a book at the same time. Choosing to focus instead of getting distracted can really change your life.

Living a focused life isn’t for everyone. It takes hard work and big changes to your habits. Many people find comfort in being busy with emails and social media, but a focused life means letting a lot of that go. It can be scary to try to create your best work because it makes you face the fact that you might not be as good as you want to be yet. It’s easier to just talk about problems instead of trying to fix them.

But if you’re ready to give up those comforts and face your fears, and really push your mind to create things that matter, you’ll find, like others have, that being focused leads to a life full of productivity and meaning. I quoted writer Winifred Gallagher earlier, who said, “I’ll live the focused life, because it’s the best kind there is.” I agree with her, and so does Bill Gates. Hopefully, now that you’ve read this book, you feel the same way too.
