As this year went on, I became really focused on my work, and the results surprised me. In the same year that I wrote a book and dealt with my son’s terrible twos, I managed to double my usual academic output, publishing nine research papers—all while sticking to my rule of not working in the evenings.

I’ll admit that my intense focus was maybe a bit too much. It was mentally tiring, and I’ll probably tone it down in the future. But this experience shows that deep work is way more powerful than most people think. It’s this commitment to focusing that helped Bill Gates take advantage of a big opportunity to create a new industry, and it helped me double my academic work while writing a book. Choosing to focus instead of getting distracted is a life-changing experience.

Living a focused life isn’t for everyone. It takes a lot of hard work and big changes to your habits. Many people find comfort in being busy with constant emails and social media, while a focused life asks you to let go of a lot of that. It can also be uncomfortable to try to create your best work because it makes you face the fact that your best might not be that great yet. It’s easier to just talk about what’s wrong in the world than to actually try to make it better.

But if you’re willing to step away from those comforts and fears and work hard to use your mind to create important things, you’ll find, like many others have, that focusing leads to a life full of productivity and meaning. I quoted writer Winifred Gallagher earlier, who said, “I’ll live the focused life, because it’s the best kind there is.” I agree with her. So does Bill Gates. And hopefully, now that you’ve read this book, you agree too.
