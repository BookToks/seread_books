Business culture can be confusing, especially when you look at things like high executive salaries that make people wonder why they exist. Without clear ways to measure success, businesses can easily get distracted and lose focus, and deep work often suffers the most in this chaos.

This lack of clear measurements sets the stage for what I’ll talk about in this chapter. I’ll explain different mind-sets and biases that have pushed businesses away from deep work and towards distractions. If it was obvious that these distractions were hurting profits, they wouldn’t last long, but the unclear measurements let these distractions take over in the work world.

One big distraction in the workplace is the culture of always being connected. People feel they have to read and respond to emails quickly. Research from Harvard Business School professor Leslie Perlow shows that professionals spend about twenty to twenty-five hours a week outside of work just checking emails, thinking they need to reply within an hour.

Some might say this is necessary in fast-paced jobs. But Perlow wanted to test this idea. She got executives at the Boston Consulting Group, a busy consulting firm, to let her change how one of their teams worked. She wanted to see if being constantly connected really helped. So, she made each team member take one day off each week with no contact at all.

At first, the team didn’t like the idea. The team leader was worried about telling clients that everyone would be offline for a day. The consultants were also anxious, thinking they might risk their jobs. But surprisingly, they didn’t lose any clients, and no one got fired. Instead, they enjoyed their work more, communicated better with each other, and learned more.
