Even though there are some good things happening in business, like the trends we talked about earlier or the really high salaries that surprised Thomas Piketty, a lot of business actions don’t have clear measurements to back them up. This means that businesses can easily get distracted and lose focus, especially when it comes to doing deep work.

This lack of clear measurements is important for understanding the points I’ll make in this chapter. I’ll explain different mindsets and biases that have led businesses away from deep work and toward more distracting activities. If it was obvious that these distractions were hurting profits, they wouldn’t last long. But because we don’t have clear measurements, distractions are taking over more and more in the work world.

One big distraction in the workplace is the constant need to stay connected. People are expected to quickly read and respond to emails and other messages. Research by Harvard Business School professor Leslie Perlow showed that professionals spend about twenty to twenty-five hours a week outside of work checking emails, thinking they need to reply within an hour.

Some people argue that this constant connection is necessary in fast-paced jobs. But Perlow wanted to find out if that was really true. She convinced a team at the Boston Consulting Group, a busy consulting firm, to try something different. She asked them to take one day off each week where they wouldn’t connect with anyone at work or outside of it.

At first, the team didn’t like the idea. The leader was worried about telling their client that everyone would be offline for a day. The consultants were also anxious, thinking they might risk their jobs. But in the end, they didn’t lose any clients or jobs. Instead, they enjoyed their work more, communicated better with each other, and learned more.
