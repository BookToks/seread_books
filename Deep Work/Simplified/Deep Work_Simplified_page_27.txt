In one study, a researcher had people solve word puzzles. Sometimes, she interrupted them to say they had to switch to a new task, like reading résumés and making hiring decisions. Other times, she let them finish the puzzles before moving on. In between these tasks, she used a quick game to see how much focus they had left from the first task.

The results were clear: when people had leftover focus from the first task, they did worse on the next one. The more leftover focus they had, the worse they performed. This idea of "attention residue" explains why some people, like Grant, are more productive. By focusing on one tough task for a long time without switching, he avoids the negative effects of leftover focus from other tasks. This means he can do better work than someone who gets distracted a lot.

Even if you can’t completely isolate yourself like Grant does, the idea of attention residue is important. It shows that working while distracted can really hurt your performance. For example, checking your email every ten minutes might seem okay, but it actually distracts you. When you see messages you can’t deal with right away, it makes it harder to focus on your main task. This leftover focus from switching tasks can lower your performance.

Looking at all this, it’s clear that to do your best work, you need to focus on one task for a long time without distractions. This kind of work is called deep work. If you can’t focus deeply for a while, it’ll be tough to reach the high levels of quality and quantity needed to succeed. Unless you’re way more talented than others, those who can focus deeply will likely outwork you.
