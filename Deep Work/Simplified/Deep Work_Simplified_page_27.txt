In one experiment, a researcher had people solve word puzzles. Sometimes, she would interrupt them and say they had to move on to a new task, like reading résumés and deciding who to hire. Other times, she let them finish the puzzles before giving them the next task. Between the puzzles and hiring, she had them play a quick game to see how much focus they still had left from the first task.

The results were clear: when people had leftover focus from switching tasks, they did worse on the next task. The more leftover focus they had, the worse they performed. This idea of "attention residue" helps explain why someone like Grant is so productive. By focusing on one hard task for a long time without switching, he reduces the negative effects of distractions from other things he has to do. This lets him do his best work.

When Grant spends days working alone on a paper, he’s more effective than a typical professor who gets interrupted a lot. Even if you can’t completely copy Grant’s way of working alone, the idea of attention residue is important. It shows that working while distracted can really hurt your performance. It might seem okay to check your email every ten minutes, but that quick look actually takes away your focus. Plus, if you see messages you can’t deal with right away, it makes it harder to get back to your main task.

Looking at all this, it’s clear: to do your best work, you need to focus on one task for a long time without distractions. This kind of focused work is called deep work. If you can’t handle working deeply for a while, it’ll be tough to reach the high levels of quality and quantity needed to succeed in your career. Unless you’re way more talented than others, those who can work deeply will likely get more done than you.
