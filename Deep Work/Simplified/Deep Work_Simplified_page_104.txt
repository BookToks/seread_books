He graduated from university with top honors. He was quickly accepted into a PhD program at one of the best universities in the country, where he studies with a famous philosopher.

One reason for this change comes from research led by Henry Roediger, who runs the Memory Lab at the University of Washington in Saint Louis. In 2014, Roediger and his team went to the Extreme Memory Tournament in San Diego with a bunch of tests. They wanted to find out what makes these amazing memorizers different from everyone else. Roediger explained in a New York Times blog that one of the biggest differences is not about memory itself but about attention. 

This ability is called “attentional control,” and it measures how well someone can focus on important information. So, when you train your memory, you also get better at concentrating. This skill can help you with any task that needs deep focus. Daniel Kilov didn’t become a top student just because he had an amazing memory; it was his effort to improve his memory that helped him concentrate better in school.

The strategy I’m sharing here helps you practice a key part of Kilov’s training, so you can also improve your focus. It involves learning a cool skill that many memory athletes use: memorizing a shuffled deck of cards. 

The method for memorizing cards comes from Ron White, a former USA Memory Champion and world record holder in card memorization. White says that professional memory athletes never just try to memorize things by repeating them over and over. This way of memorizing is common among tired students, but it doesn’t really work well with how our brains function. We’re not great at quickly remembering abstract info, but we are really good at recalling scenes. 

Think about a recent memorable event in your life, like going to a conference or meeting a friend for a drink. Try to picture that scene as clearly as you can. Most people can remember these events in great detail, even though they didn’t try hard to remember them at the time. If you counted all the unique details in that memory, you’d be surprised by how many you could recall.
