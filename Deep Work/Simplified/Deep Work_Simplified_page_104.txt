He graduated from university with top honors and got into a PhD program at one of the best schools in the country. Now, he studies with a famous philosopher.

One reason for his success comes from research by Henry Roediger, who leads the Memory Lab at the University of Washington in Saint Louis. In 2014, Roediger and his team went to the Extreme Memory Tournament in San Diego. They wanted to find out what makes these memory champions different from everyone else. Roediger explained in a New York Times blog that one major difference is not just about memory, but about attention. This ability, called “attentional control,” helps people focus on important information.

So, when you train your memory, you also get better at concentrating. This improved focus can help you with any task that needs deep thinking. Daniel Kilov didn’t become a top student just because he has a great memory; it was his effort to improve his memory that gave him the focus he needed to succeed in school.

The strategy I’m going to share with you is similar to what Kilov did, and it can help you concentrate better too. It involves learning a cool skill that most memory athletes have: memorizing a shuffled deck of cards. The method I’ll teach you comes from Ron White, a former USA Memory Champion and world record holder for card memorization.

White points out that professional memory athletes never just try to memorize by repeating information over and over. This way of studying is popular among tired students, but it doesn’t really work well with how our brains function. We’re not great at quickly remembering abstract facts. However, we are really good at remembering scenes. Think about a recent event you enjoyed, like going to a conference or catching up with a friend. Try to picture it clearly. Most people can remember these moments vividly, even if they didn’t try hard to remember them at the time. If you counted all the unique details from that memory, you’d be surprised at how many you can recall.
