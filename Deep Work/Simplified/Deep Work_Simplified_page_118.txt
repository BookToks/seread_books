abandon them—but not everyone. You might think it’s unfair that only a few activities can really influence your choices about these tools. For example, Facebook can be great for your social life, so why would you give it up just because it doesn’t help with the few activities you think are most important? The important thing to know is that cutting down on what you focus on isn’t random. It’s based on an idea that comes up in many areas, like business profits, social fairness, and even computer crashes.

The Law of the Vital Few: In many situations, 80 percent of the results come from just 20 percent of the causes. 

For instance, 80 percent of a company’s profits might come from just 20 percent of its customers. Or, 80 percent of a country’s wealth is owned by the richest 20 percent of people. Also, 80 percent of software crashes can be traced back to just 20 percent of the bugs. There’s a math reason behind this (the 80/20 rule is a common pattern in the real world), but it’s most helpful to remember that not all contributions are equal.

Let’s say this rule applies to the important goals in your life. Many activities can help you reach these goals. The law of the vital few reminds us that the most important 20 percent of these activities give you most of the benefits. If you can think of ten to fifteen activities that could help you with your goals, this law says to focus on the top two or three activities that really make a difference in whether you succeed.

Even if you agree with this, you might still think it’s not a good idea to ignore the other 80 percent of helpful activities. It’s true that these less important activities don’t help as much as your top one or two, but they can still be useful, so why not keep them around? As long as you don’t forget about the more important activities, it seems okay to include some of the less important ones too.

However, this thinking misses a key point: all activities, no matter how important, take up your limited time and attention. If you focus on the less important activities, you might not have enough time for the ones that really matter.
