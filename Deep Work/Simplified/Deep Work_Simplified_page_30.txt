This is a story about some really important management consultants who thought they needed to be connected to their emails all the time to help their clients. But when a Harvard professor made them take breaks from their devices for a study, they were surprised to find out that being constantly connected wasn’t as important as they thought. Their clients didn’t need to reach them all the time, and once they focused better, they actually did a better job as consultants.

I know some managers who believe they are most useful when they can quickly help their teams with problems to keep projects moving. They think their job is to help others be productive, not just to take care of their own tasks. But when we talked more about it, we found out that they didn’t really need to be constantly available. Many software companies now use a method called Scrum for project management. This method cuts down on random messaging and replaces it with regular, organized meetings that are short and to the point. These meetings help managers spend more time thinking about the challenges their teams face, which often leads to better results.

In simpler terms, while being able to focus deeply on work is important, it’s not the only skill that matters in today’s world. You can still do well without being super focused, but those situations are becoming less common. Unless you have a really good reason to think that distractions are important for your job, it’s better to focus on doing deep work.
