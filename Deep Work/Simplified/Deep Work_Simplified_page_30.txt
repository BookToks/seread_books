There’s a story about a group of really important management consultants who thought they needed to be connected to their emails all the time to help their clients. But when a Harvard professor made them disconnect more often for a study, they were surprised to find out that being constantly connected wasn’t as important as they thought. Their clients didn’t need to reach them all the time, and the consultants actually did better work when they weren’t so distracted.

I know some managers who believe they’re most helpful when they can quickly solve their team’s problems to keep projects moving. They think their job is to help others be productive, not just to take care of their own work. But when we talked more, it turned out that they didn’t really need to be constantly available. Many software companies now use a method called Scrum for project management. This method cuts down on random messages and instead has regular, organized meetings that are quick and to the point. This way, managers have more time to think deeply about the challenges their teams face, which often leads to better results.

In simpler terms, while deep work is a valuable skill, it’s not the only one that matters. You can succeed without it, but those situations are becoming less common. Unless you have a good reason to believe that being distracted is important for your job, it’s better to focus on doing deep work.
