Don’t Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself

Arnold Bennett was an English writer who lived around the early 1900s, a time when his country was going through a lot of changes. The industrial revolution had created a new group of workers called white-collar workers. These people could work in offices for a set number of hours each week and earn a steady paycheck to support their families. This kind of life seems normal to us now, but for Bennett and others back then, it was new and sometimes stressful. Bennett worried that these workers were missing out on living life to the fullest.

He talks about a typical office worker in London who works from ten in the morning to six in the evening and spends about fifty minutes commuting to and from work. This person has a little over sixteen hours left in the day after work. Bennett thinks that’s a lot of time, but many people don’t see its value. He points out that the big mistake this worker makes is thinking of the work hours as the whole day, while the time before and after work is just a warm-up and cool-down. He believes this way of thinking is completely wrong and unhealthy.

So, what should this worker do instead? Bennett suggests that he should think of those sixteen free hours as a “day within a day.” During this time, he is free and not worried about money, just like someone who is rich. Bennett believes this time should be used for self-improvement, mainly by reading great books and poetry.

Bennett wrote about these ideas over a hundred years ago. You might think that since then, our views on free time would have changed, especially as the middle class grew around the world. But they really haven’t.
