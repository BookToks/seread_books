Don’t Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself

Arnold Bennett was a writer from England who lived around the early 1900s, a time when his country was going through a lot of changes. The industrial revolution had created a new type of worker: the white-collar worker. This meant people could have jobs where they worked in an office for a set number of hours each week and got paid enough to support their families. While this lifestyle seems normal to us now, it was new and kind of stressful for Bennett and others back then. Bennett worried that these workers were missing out on living a full life.

He gives an example of a guy in London who works in an office from ten in the morning to six at night and spends almost an hour traveling to and from work. This guy only has a little over sixteen hours left in his day after work. Bennett thinks that’s a lot of time, but many people don’t see how valuable it is. He points out that this guy makes a big mistake by thinking of his work hours as his whole day. He sees those hours as the main part of his life, while the time before and after work is just extra. Bennett believes this way of thinking is completely wrong and unhealthy.

So, what should this guy do instead? Bennett suggests he should think of those sixteen free hours as a “day within a day.” During that time, he is free and not worried about money. He should use this time to better himself, like someone who is wealthy would do. Bennett believes this means reading great books and poetry to improve his mind.

Bennett wrote about these ideas over a hundred years ago. You might think that since then, as the middle class grew around the world, our views on free time would have changed. But they really haven’t.
