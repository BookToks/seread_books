I spend my evenings with my wife and two sons, and I read a surprising number of books for a busy dad. Overall, not having a lot of distractions in my life helps calm my mind, which is often racing like many people’s these days. I’m okay with being bored, and that can actually be a really useful skill—especially on a lazy summer night in D.C. when I’m listening to a Nationals game on the radio.

This book is basically my way of explaining why I prefer deep thinking over shallow stuff. I want to share some strategies that have helped me focus on what really matters. I’ve written this down partly to help you learn how to build your life around deep work, but that’s not the only reason. I also want to clarify my own thoughts. I know that understanding deep work has helped me do better, but I believe I can still do even more. As you work through the ideas and rules in the chapters ahead, know that I’m doing the same—cutting out the shallow stuff and really focusing on what’s important. You’ll see how it goes for me at the end of the book.

When Carl Jung wanted to change psychiatry, he built a retreat in the woods. His Bollingen Tower became a place where he could think deeply and create amazing work that changed the world. In the pages that follow, I’ll encourage you to create your own personal Bollingen Tower. Together, we can learn to produce real value in a world full of distractions and understand something important that many successful people from the past believed: A deep life is a good life.
