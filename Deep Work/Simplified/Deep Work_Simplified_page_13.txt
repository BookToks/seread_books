In the evenings, I spend time with my wife and two sons, and I manage to read a surprising number of books, even though I’m a busy dad. I’ve noticed that not having too many distractions helps me feel less anxious, which seems to be a problem for a lot of people these days. I’m okay with being bored, and this skill can actually be pretty rewarding—especially on a chill summer night in D.C. when I’m listening to a Nationals game on the radio.

This book is about my desire for deep thinking instead of shallow stuff, and I want to share some strategies that have helped me focus on what really matters. I’ve written this down partly to help you learn how to build your life around deep work. But there’s more to it. I also want to clarify my own thoughts because I know I can still improve. I’ve seen how deep work has helped me succeed, but I believe I can do even better. As you work through the ideas and rules in the chapters ahead, know that I’m also working hard to cut out the shallow stuff and focus on what really counts. You’ll see how I do by the end of this book.

When Carl Jung wanted to change psychiatry, he built a retreat in the woods. His Bollingen Tower became a place where he could think deeply and create amazing work that changed the world. In the upcoming pages, I’ll encourage you to create your own version of a Bollingen Tower. This means finding ways to produce real value in a world full of distractions and understanding a truth that many successful people from the past believed: A deep life is a good life.
