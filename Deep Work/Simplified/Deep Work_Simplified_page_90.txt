I quickly look over all my tasks and check my calendar for the next few days. This helps me make sure I’m not forgetting anything important, like deadlines or appointments. By this point, I’ve looked at everything I need to do for work. To finish up, I use what I’ve seen to make a rough plan for the next day. Once I have my plan, I say, “Shutdown complete,” and I’m done thinking about work for the day.

At first, the idea of a shutdown ritual might seem a bit much, but it makes sense because of something called the Zeigarnik effect. This effect, named after a psychologist named Bluma Zeigarnik, explains how unfinished tasks can take over our thoughts. If you just stop working at five p.m. and say, “I’m done until tomorrow,” you might find it hard to stop thinking about work. All the tasks you didn’t finish will keep popping into your head and distract you all evening.

It might feel impossible to deal with this at first. Anyone who has a busy job knows there are always tasks left undone. The idea that you can finish everything is just a dream. Luckily, you don’t have to finish a task to stop thinking about it. A psychologist named Roy Baumeister and his colleague E.J. Masicampo did a study called “Consider It Done!” They found that if you make a plan for how you’ll finish an incomplete task after being interrupted, it helps clear your mind. Their research showed that making a specific plan can help you reach your goals and free up your brain for other things.

The shutdown ritual I mentioned earlier uses this idea to fight the Zeigarnik effect. It doesn’t make you write a plan for every single task, which would be too much work. Instead, it helps you list all your tasks and review them before making a plan for the next day. This way, you won’t forget any tasks because you’ll look at them every day and handle them when it’s the right time. In other words, your mind doesn’t have to keep track of everything all the time—your shutdown ritual takes care of that for you.
