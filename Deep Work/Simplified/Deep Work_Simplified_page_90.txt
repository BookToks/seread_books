At the end of the day, I quickly check all my tasks and look at my calendar for the next few days. This helps me see if there’s anything urgent I’m missing or important deadlines coming up. By this point, I’ve looked at everything I need to do for work. To finish my routine, I use this info to make a rough plan for the next day. Once I have my plan, I say, “Shutdown complete,” and I’m done thinking about work for the day.

The idea of a shutdown ritual might seem a bit much at first, but it’s actually really helpful because of something called the Zeigarnik effect. This effect, named after a psychologist named Bluma Zeigarnik, explains how unfinished tasks can take over our thoughts. If you just stop working at five p.m. and say, “I’m done until tomorrow,” you might find it hard to stop thinking about work. All the things you didn’t finish will keep popping into your head and distract you all evening.

At first, this might feel impossible to fix. Anyone who has a busy job knows there are always things left undone. The idea that you can finish everything is just a dream. Luckily, you don’t have to finish a task to stop thinking about it. A psychologist named Roy Baumeister and his colleague E.J. Masicampo found a way to help with this. They did a study where they made people start a task and then interrupted them. They discovered that if they asked people to make a plan for how to finish the task after the interruption, it helped them focus better. They said that making a specific plan not only helps you reach your goal but also frees up your mind for other things.

The shutdown ritual I mentioned earlier uses this idea to fight the Zeigarnik effect. It doesn’t make you write down a plan for every single task, which would be too much. Instead, it helps you list all your tasks and review them before planning for the next day. This way, you won’t forget anything. You’ll look at each task daily and deal with them when it’s the right time. Basically, your mind doesn’t have to keep track of everything all the time because your shutdown ritual takes care of that.
