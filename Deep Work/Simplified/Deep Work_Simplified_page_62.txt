Years of email is way too much for one lifetime. Email is great for people who like to stay on top of everything. But that’s not me; I prefer to focus on my work. What I do takes a lot of studying and needs my full attention.

Knuth says he doesn’t want to completely shut himself off from the world. He knows that writing his books means he has to talk to a lot of people, and he wants to answer their questions and comments. So, what’s his solution? He gives out a postal mailing address. His assistant will check the letters that come in and keep the important ones for him. If something is really urgent, she’ll let Knuth know right away, and he’ll deal with everything else every three months or so.

Knuth uses what I call the “monastic philosophy” of deep work scheduling. This idea is all about focusing on important work by cutting out distractions. People who follow this philosophy usually have a clear goal they want to achieve, and most of their success comes from doing that one thing really well. This focus helps them ignore the little things that can get in the way of those who have more varied jobs.

For example, Knuth explains his goal like this: “I try to learn certain areas of computer science really well; then I share that knowledge in a way that’s easy for others to understand.” Trying to convince Knuth to use Twitter or email more won’t work because those things don’t help him reach his goal of understanding computer science deeply and writing about it clearly.

Another person who believes in deep work is the famous science fiction writer Neal Stephenson. If you check out his author website, you’ll see there’s no email or mailing address listed. We can understand why from some essays he wrote on his old website back in the early 2000s. In one essay from 2003, Stephenson explains his communication policy like this: 

“People who want to interrupt my focus are kindly asked not to, and I don’t answer emails… just to make it clear, I will put it.”
