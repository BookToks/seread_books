You have a limited amount of willpower that gets used up as you go through your day. 

Think of your willpower like a muscle that gets tired. This is why people in studies, like the one by Hofmann and Baumeister, struggled to resist distractions. Over time, their willpower ran low, making it hard to focus. This can happen to you too, no matter how good your intentions are—unless you’re smart about your habits.

To build a strong habit of deep work, you need to go beyond just wanting to do it. You should create routines and rituals that help you use less willpower when you need to focus. For example, if you decide in the middle of a distracting afternoon to switch to a tough task, it will take a lot of willpower to pull your attention away from the internet. This is why those attempts often fail. 

But if you set up smart routines—like having a specific time and quiet place for your deep work—you’ll find it easier to start and keep going. In the long run, this will help you succeed more often with your deep work.

The six strategies that follow are like tools to help you create these routines and rituals, keeping in mind that willpower is limited. They will help you plan your work and develop ways to boost your focus before you start each session. Some strategies will help motivate you, while others will help recharge your willpower quickly.

You could try to make deep work a priority on your own. But using these strategies—or coming up with your own based on the same ideas—will make it much more likely that you can make deep work an important part of your life.
