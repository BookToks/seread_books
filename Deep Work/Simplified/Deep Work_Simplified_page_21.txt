Because technology changes so fast, learning tough stuff is a never-ending process. You have to get good at it quickly and keep doing it over and over. This skill of learning hard things fast isn’t just important for working with smart machines; it’s also crucial if you want to be a superstar in almost any field, even ones that aren’t tech-related. For example, to be an amazing yoga teacher, you need to master a lot of complicated physical skills. Similarly, if you want to be great in medicine, you have to quickly learn the latest research on medical procedures. In short, if you can’t learn, you can’t succeed.

Now let’s talk about the second important skill: producing at a high level. To become a superstar, you need to learn the right skills, but that’s not enough. You also have to turn what you’ve learned into real results that people appreciate. Many programmers can code well, but David Hansson, who we talked about earlier, used his skills to create Ruby on Rails, which made him famous. This project pushed his skills to the max and produced clear and valuable results.

This ability to produce also matters for those working with smart machines. Nate Silver didn’t just learn how to handle big data and run stats; he had to show he could use those skills to find information that a lot of people cared about. While he worked with many stats experts at Baseball Prospectus, it was Silver who put in the effort to apply these skills to the more profitable field of election forecasting. This shows another important point: If you don’t produce, you won’t succeed, no matter how talented you are.

Now that we’ve talked about two key skills for getting ahead in our tech-driven world, let’s ask the next question: How do you develop these skills? This brings us to a main idea of this book: The two skills we just discussed rely on your ability to do deep work. If you haven’t learned this basic skill, you’ll find it hard to learn tough things or produce at a high level. The link between these skills and deep work isn’t obvious at first; it takes a closer look at how we learn, focus, and get things done. The upcoming sections will explore this connection.
