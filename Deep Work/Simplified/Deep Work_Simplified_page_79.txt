Brattain and Bardeen worked closely together, helping each other create better designs. They did this by focusing really hard on their tasks. Brattain would work on experiments based on Bardeen’s new ideas, while Bardeen would try to understand what Brattain's experiments showed. This teamwork is a special kind of deep work that I call the "whiteboard effect." When you work with someone else, like at a shared whiteboard, it can help you think deeper than if you were alone. Having someone there waiting for your next idea can push you to focus more.

Looking at Building 20 and Bell Labs, we can see that you don’t need to work alone to be productive. In fact, working together can lead to better results, especially when trying to come up with new ideas. So, when you think about how to include deep work in your job, consider working with others. But remember two important things.

First, distractions can ruin your focus. So, it’s important to keep your time for random ideas separate from your time for deep thinking. Try to keep these efforts apart instead of mixing them together, which can mess up both.

Second, even when you take time to think deeply, don’t hesitate to work with someone else when it makes sense. Collaborating on a problem can help both of you think deeper and create better results than if you were working alone. So, when you want to do deep work, think about teaming up when it’s helpful, but don’t let the need for interaction distract you from focusing on your ideas.
