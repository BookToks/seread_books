Working together can help us create better designs. This teamwork involves really focusing on our tasks, but in a way that’s a bit different from what we usually see. Brattain would focus hard on making a new design based on Bardeen’s ideas. Then, Bardeen would focus just as hard to understand what Brattain’s experiments showed, trying to adjust his theories to fit what they found. This back-and-forth teamwork is a special kind of deep work that’s common in schools and research. I call it the "whiteboard effect." Sometimes, working with someone else can help you think deeper than if you were just by yourself. Having someone else there, whether in person or online, can push you to dive deeper into your thoughts.

Now, let’s look at what we can learn about teamwork and deep work. The success of places like Building 20 and Bell Labs shows that you don’t have to work alone to be productive. In fact, for many tasks, especially when trying to come up with new ideas, working together can lead to better results. So, when you think about how to focus deeply in your work life, consider teaming up with others. But remember these two important tips.

First, distractions can ruin your focus. So, it’s important to keep your random ideas separate from your deep thinking. Try to work on each one separately instead of mixing them up, which can make both harder to achieve.

Second, even when you’re trying to think deeply, if it makes sense to work with someone else, do it. By teaming up on a problem, you can help each other think more deeply and come up with better ideas than if you were working alone. So, when you’re doing deep work, think about collaborating when it makes sense, as it can take your results to the next level. But don’t get so caught up in working with others that you lose the focus needed to really make sense of all the ideas around you.
