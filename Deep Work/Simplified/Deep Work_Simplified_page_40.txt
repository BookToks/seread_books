sign in enough during the day. She was, in a way, punishing her workers for not checking their emails more often (which is one of the main reasons to log in). “If you’re not looking busy,” she hinted, “I’ll think you’re not getting anything done.”

But if we look at this fairly, it doesn’t really make sense. Knowledge work isn’t like a factory where you just put things together, and getting good results from information often means not being busy all the time. For example, remember Adam Grant, the smart guy from the last chapter who became a professor at Wharton by shutting himself off to focus on writing? That’s the opposite of being busy in front of everyone. If Grant worked for Yahoo, Marissa Mayer might have let him go. But his focused approach ended up creating a lot of value.

We could get rid of this outdated idea of always being busy if we could easily show how it hurts the company’s profits, but that’s hard to do. The confusion around job roles and the lack of clear ways to measure how well different strategies work lets silly behaviors continue in our complicated work lives.

Next, we’ll see that even people who know how to succeed in their knowledge work can still get distracted. Sometimes, all it takes is a tempting idea that makes you forget what makes sense.

The Cult of the Internet

Take Alissa Rubin, for example. She’s the bureau chief for the New York Times in Paris. Before that, she was in Kabul, Afghanistan, reporting on important events after the war. While I was writing this chapter, she was publishing serious articles about how the French government was involved in the Rwandan genocide. Rubin is a skilled journalist. However, she also tweets, probably because her employer keeps pushing her to do it.

Rubin’s Twitter shows that she posts a tweet every two to four days, almost like she gets reminders from the Times’ social media team (which is real) to keep her followers happy. Most of her tweets just mention articles she liked. Rubin is a reporter, not a social media star. Her real value to her paper is her ability to report important news.
