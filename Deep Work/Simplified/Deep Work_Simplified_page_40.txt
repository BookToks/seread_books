sign in enough during the day. She was, in a way, punishing her workers for not checking their email more often (which is a big reason to log in to the servers). “If you’re not looking busy,” she seemed to say, “I’ll think you’re not working hard.”

But if you look at it fairly, this idea is outdated. Knowledge work isn’t like a factory assembly line, and getting value from information often means not being busy all the time. For example, remember Adam Grant, the smart guy from the last chapter who became the youngest full professor at Wharton? He would shut himself off from distractions to focus on his writing. That’s the opposite of looking busy. If Grant worked at Yahoo, Marissa Mayer might have fired him. But his focused work ended up being super valuable.

We could get rid of this old idea of needing to look busy if we could easily show how it hurts the company’s profits, but that’s where things get tricky. There’s a confusing mix of unclear job roles and no good way to measure how well different strategies work. This allows silly behaviors to continue in the confusing world of our daily work.

Next, we’ll see that even people who know what it takes to do well in their knowledge work can still get distracted. All it takes is a convincing idea that makes you ignore common sense.

Take Alissa Rubin, for example. She’s the bureau chief for the New York Times in Paris. Before that, she was in Kabul, Afghanistan, where she reported on important issues after the war. While I was writing this chapter, she was publishing serious articles about the French government’s role in the Rwandan genocide. Rubin is a skilled journalist who knows her stuff. But, I can only guess that her boss keeps pushing her to tweet.

Rubin’s Twitter shows that she posts every two to four days, almost like she gets reminders from the Times’ social media team (which is real) telling her to keep her followers happy. Most of her tweets just mention an article she read and liked. Rubin is a reporter, not a celebrity. Her real value to her paper is her ability to...
