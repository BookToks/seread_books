Lewis is worried that making things more accessible will drain his energy and make it harder for him to write great stories. He says, “It’s crazy how accessible everyone is. A lot of the communication in my life doesn’t help me; it actually makes things worse.” Packer also has concerns about distractions. He calls Twitter “crack for media addicts” and thinks Carr’s excitement about it is “the scariest view of the future I’ve read so far this decade.”

We don’t need to debate if these authors are right for avoiding Twitter and similar tools because their success shows they know what they’re doing. Instead, we can see their choices as a brave example of how to pick the right tools. Many people, especially in creative jobs, still think any tool is good, so it’s nice to see a more thoughtful way of choosing what to use. But the fact that these examples are rare reminds us that making smart choices like this isn’t easy. Remember how complicated it was for Forrest Pritchard to decide on his hay baler? For many people and the tools they use, these choices can be just as tough. The goal of this strategy is to help make this decision process easier and to figure out which tools really matter to you.

The first step is to figure out your main goals in both your work and personal life. If you have a family, your personal goals might be about being a good parent and keeping your home organized. For work, your goals will depend on your job. For example, as a professor, I focus on being a good teacher and mentor for my grad students, as well as being a strong researcher. Your goals will probably be different, but it’s important to keep the list short and focused on what really matters. If your goal is too specific, like “to make a million dollars in sales” or “to publish six papers in a year,” then it’s too detailed for this exercise. When you finish, you should have a few key goals for both your personal and work life.

After you have your goals, write down two or three important activities for each goal that help you achieve them. These activities should be clear enough that you can easily imagine doing them, but not so specific that they are tied to just one outcome. For example, “do better research” is a good start.
