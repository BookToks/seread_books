Gonzalez talks about computer programming like woodworkers talk about their craft. In a popular book called *The Pragmatic Programmer*, they connect coding to old-fashioned craftsmanship by quoting a saying from medieval stone workers: “We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals.” The book explains that programmers should think about their work in the same way.

Every project has room for personal style and skill. In a hundred years, the way we engineer things might seem outdated, just like how medieval builders seem old-fashioned to today’s engineers. But the skill we put into our work will still be respected.

You don’t have to be working in a barn for your work to be considered craftsmanship. Many skilled jobs in today’s economy can have this same potential. Whether you’re a writer, marketer, consultant, or lawyer, your work is a craft. If you improve your skills and do your job with care, you can find meaning in your everyday professional life, just like a skilled craftsman.

Some people might think their job isn’t meaningful because it seems too boring. But that’s not true, and thinking this way can be fixed by looking at traditional craftsmanship. In our culture, we focus a lot on job titles. We often hear advice to “follow your passion,” which suggests that the specific job you choose is what really matters for your happiness. This makes some jobs seem special, like working for a nonprofit or starting a tech company, while others seem dull.

But Dreyfus and Kelly’s ideas help us break free from this way of thinking. The craftsmen they mention didn’t have fancy jobs. For most of history, being a blacksmith or a wheelwright wasn’t glamorous. But that doesn’t matter because what’s important is the skill and care in their work, not what they made. In other words, a wooden wheel might not be impressive, but the way it’s made can be. The same goes for knowledge work. You don’t need a fancy job; you just need to have a special approach to your work.
