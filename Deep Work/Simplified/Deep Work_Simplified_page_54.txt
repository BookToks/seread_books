Gonzalez talks about computer programming like woodworkers talk about their craft, as mentioned by Dreyfus and Kelly. In a popular book called The Pragmatic Programmer, it connects coding to old-school craftsmanship by quoting a saying from medieval stone workers: “We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals.” The book explains that programmers should think of their work in a similar way. 

In any project, there’s always space for personal style and skill. A hundred years from now, the way we engineer things might seem outdated, just like how medieval builders seem to today’s engineers. But the skill we put into our work will still be respected. You don’t need to be working in a barn for your efforts to be seen as craftsmanship. Most skilled jobs in today’s information economy can have this same potential for craftsmanship. Whether you’re a writer, marketer, consultant, or lawyer, your work is a craft. If you improve your skills and do your job with care, you can find meaning in your everyday work, just like a skilled craftsman.

Some people might think their job can’t be meaningful because it seems too boring. But that’s not true, and thinking about traditional craftsmanship can help change that view. Nowadays, we focus a lot on job titles. We often hear advice to “follow your passion,” which suggests that the specific job you choose is what matters most for being happy in your career. This leads to the idea that only certain jobs, like working for a nonprofit or starting a tech company, can be fulfilling, while all other jobs are dull.

Dreyfus and Kelly’s ideas help us break free from this way of thinking. The craftsmen they mention didn’t have fancy jobs. For most of history, being a blacksmith or wheelwright wasn’t glamorous. But that doesn’t matter because what gives meaning to their work is the skill and care they put into it, not the job itself. In other words, a wooden wheel might not seem special, but the process of making it can be. The same goes for knowledge work. You don’t need a fancy job; you just need a special attitude toward your work.
