In the crazy world of online chatter, it can feel pointless and even a bit insulting sometimes. At its worst, it can be really distracting. George Packer, a writer for the New Yorker, explained this fear in an essay about why he doesn’t use Twitter. He said, “Twitter is like crack for people who can’t stop using media. It freaks me out, not because I think I’m better than it, but because I don’t think I could handle it. I’m scared I’d end up ignoring my son.” Interestingly, when he wrote that, he was busy working on his book called The Unwinding, which came out soon after and won a big award, even though he wasn’t on social media.

To sum it up, big trends in business today are making it harder for people to do focused work. Even though these trends promise benefits like more chances for good luck, quicker replies, and more visibility, they don’t compare to the advantages of really focusing on deep work. This chapter aims to explain this contradiction. The reason deep work is rare isn’t because there’s something wrong with the habit itself. When we dig deeper into why we get distracted at work, we’ll see that the reasons are more random than we think, based on bad thinking and the confusion that often comes with knowledge work. I want to show you that while we currently accept distraction as normal, it’s not a solid way to work, and you can easily change that by developing a strong work ethic.

In the fall of 2012, Tom Cochran, who was the tech chief at Atlantic Media, got worried about how much time he was spending on email. So, like any tech-savvy person, he decided to track it. He found out that in one week, he got 511 emails and sent 284. That’s about 160 emails a day over a five-day workweek. He calculated that even if he spent just thirty seconds on each message, he was wasting almost an hour and a half each day just moving information around, like a human computer. That seemed like a lot of time spent on something that wasn’t even the main part of his job.

Cochran wrote about this experiment in a blog post for the Harvard Business Review. These numbers made him think about the rest of his company. How much time were the employees at Atlantic Media spending just moving information around instead of focusing on the important tasks they were hired to do? Determined to find out, Cochran looked into the whole company.
