In the crazy world of online chatter, it can feel pointless and even kind of insulting at times. It can also be super distracting. George Packer, a writer for The New Yorker, shared his worries about Twitter in an essay. He said, “Twitter is like crack for people who love media. It freaks me out, not because I think I’m better than it, but because I don’t think I could handle it. I’m scared I’d end up ignoring my kid.” Interestingly, while he was writing that essay, he was also working on his book, *The Unwinding*, which came out soon after and won a big award, even though he wasn’t using social media.

To sum it up, big trends in business today make it harder for people to focus deeply on their work. Even though these trends promise benefits like quicker responses and more chances to connect, they don’t compare to the advantages of really focusing on your work. This chapter aims to explain this contradiction. The reason deep work is rare isn’t because it’s a weak habit. If we look closely at why we get distracted at work, we’ll find the reasons are more random than we think. They come from flawed ideas and the confusion that often comes with knowledge work. My goal is to show you that while distractions are real, they’re based on shaky ground and can be ignored if you decide to build a strong work ethic.

In the fall of 2012, Tom Cochran, the tech chief at Atlantic Media, got worried about how much time he was spending on email. So, like any tech-savvy person, he decided to track it. He found out that in one week, he got 511 emails and sent 284. That’s about 160 emails a day over a five-day workweek. He calculated that even if he spent just thirty seconds on each email, that would add up to almost an hour and a half a day just moving information around. That seemed like a lot of time spent on something that wasn’t really part of his main job.

Cochran wrote a blog post about his findings for the Harvard Business Review. These numbers made him think about the rest of his company. How much time were the employees at Atlantic Media spending just moving information around instead of focusing on the important tasks they were hired to do? Determined to find out, Cochran decided to look into it further.
