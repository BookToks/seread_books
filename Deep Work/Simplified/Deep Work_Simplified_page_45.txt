At one point, about halfway through making a sword, Furrer finishes shaping the metal. He starts to carefully turn the hot metal in a narrow trough filled with burning charcoal. As he looks at the blade, he realizes, “It’s ready.” He lifts the glowing red sword, holding it away from himself, and quickly walks to a pipe filled with oil to cool it down. After a moment of relief that the blade didn’t break, which often happens at this stage, Furrer pulls it out of the oil. The leftover heat from the metal ignites the oil, covering the sword in bright yellow flames. Furrer raises the flaming sword above his head with one strong arm and gazes at it for a moment before blowing out the fire. During this short pause, the flames light up his face, and you can see how much he admires his work. “Doing it right is the hardest thing I know how to do,” Furrer says. “And that challenge is what keeps me going. I don’t need a sword, but I have to make them.”

Ric Furrer is a master craftsman who spends most of his day focused on his work. Even a small mistake can ruin hours of effort. He really finds meaning in what he does. This idea that deep work can lead to a good life is well-known in the world of craftsmen. “The joy of creating something with your hands can make a person calm and happy,” says Matthew Crawford, and we believe him. 

But when we look at knowledge work, this connection gets confusing. One problem is clarity. Craftsmen like Furrer face clear challenges that are hard to complete, which helps them find purpose. Knowledge work, on the other hand, is often unclear. It can be tough to explain exactly what someone in knowledge work does and how it’s different from others. On bad days, it can feel like all knowledge work is just a tiring cycle of emails and PowerPoint presentations, with only the charts in the slides making one job different from another. Furrer himself feels this dullness when he says, “The world of the Internet and cyberspace doesn’t excite me.”

Another issue that makes it hard to connect deep work with meaning in knowledge work is the noise from people telling knowledge workers to focus on shallow tasks. As mentioned earlier, we live in a time where anything related to the Internet is seen as new and necessary. Shallow activities like quick email replies and being active on social media are praised, while avoiding these trends makes you seem out of touch.
