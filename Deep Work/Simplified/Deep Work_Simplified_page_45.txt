At one point, about halfway through making the sword, Furrer finishes shaping the metal. He carefully spins the metal in a narrow trough filled with burning charcoal. As he looks at the blade, he realizes, “It’s ready.” He lifts the hot sword, holding it away from his body, and quickly walks to a pipe filled with oil, where he dips the blade to cool it. After a moment of relief that the blade didn’t crack, which can happen at this stage, Furrer pulls it out of the oil. The heat from the metal ignites the oil, covering the sword in yellow flames. Furrer raises the burning sword above his head with one strong arm and stares at it for a moment before blowing out the fire. During this quick pause, the flames light up his face, and you can see how much he admires his work. “To do it right, it is the most complicated thing I know how to make,” Furrer says. “And it’s that challenge that drives me. I don’t need a sword. But I have to make them.”

Ric Furrer is a master craftsman who spends most of his day focused. Even a small mistake can ruin hours of hard work. He clearly finds a lot of meaning in what he does. This connection between hard work and a good life is well-known in the world of craftsmen. “The satisfaction of showing your skills in the world can make a person calm and happy,” says Matthew Crawford. And we believe him.

But when we look at knowledge work, this connection gets confusing. One problem is clarity. Craftsmen like Furrer face challenges that are easy to understand but hard to do, which helps them find purpose. Knowledge work, on the other hand, is often unclear. It can be tough to explain what a knowledge worker does and how it’s different from someone else’s job. On bad days, it can feel like all knowledge work is just a tiring cycle of emails and PowerPoint presentations, with only the charts in the slides making one job different from another. Furrer himself notices this dullness when he says, “The world of information and the internet has left me feeling cold and uninterested.”

Another problem that makes it hard to connect deep work and meaning in knowledge work is the noise from people trying to get knowledge workers to do more shallow tasks. As mentioned before, we live in a time where anything related to the internet is seen as innovative and necessary. Shallow activities like quick email replies and being active on social media are praised, while avoiding these trends makes you feel out of touch.
