Conclusion  
The story of how Microsoft started is so famous that it feels like a legend. In the winter of 1974, a young Harvard student named Bill Gates saw the Altair, the first personal computer, on the cover of Popular Electronics. Gates realized he could create software for it, so he dropped everything. With help from Paul Allen and Monte Davidoff, he spent eight weeks putting together a version of the BASIC programming language for the Altair. This story shows how smart and brave Gates was, but new interviews have revealed another important trait: his amazing ability to focus deeply.  

Walter Isaacson wrote in a 2013 article for the Harvard Gazette that Gates worked so hard during those two months that he would often fall asleep on his keyboard while coding. He would sleep for an hour or two, then wake up and continue right where he left off. Paul Allen described this as “a prodigious feat of concentration.” In his book The Innovators, Isaacson explained that Gates was different from Allen because of his focus. While Allen jumped between many ideas, Gates was obsessed with one thing at a time.  

This story of Gates's intense focus supports my argument for deep work. In our fast-changing world, it’s easy to complain about how distracted we are. Some people worry about how much time we spend on our phones and wish for the days when we could concentrate without interruptions. Others think that being connected all the time is the way to a better future. Marshall McLuhan said, “the medium is the message,” but now it seems like people think “the medium is morality”—either you support social media or you think it’s ruining us.  

As I said in the introduction of this book, I’m not interested in that debate. Deep work isn’t a moral choice or a philosophical idea; it’s a practical way to recognize that focusing is a skill that helps us achieve important things. Deep work matters not because distractions are bad, but because it helped Bill Gates create a billion-dollar industry in less than a year.
