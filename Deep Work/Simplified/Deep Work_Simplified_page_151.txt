Conclusion

The story of how Microsoft started is so famous that it feels like a legend. In the winter of 1974, a young student named Bill Gates saw the Altair, the first personal computer, on the cover of a magazine called Popular Electronics. Gates realized he could create software for this computer, so he dropped everything. With help from Paul Allen and Monte Davidoff, he spent the next eight weeks putting together a version of the BASIC programming language for the Altair. This story shows Gates’s smart thinking and bravery, but recent interviews also highlight another important trait: his amazing ability to focus deeply.

As Walter Isaacson explained in a 2013 article for the Harvard Gazette, Gates worked so hard during those two months that he would sometimes fall asleep on his keyboard while writing code. He would sleep for an hour or two, then wake up and continue right where he left off. Paul Allen described this as “a prodigious feat of concentration.” In his book The Innovators, Isaacson pointed out that Gates was different from Allen because of his focus. While Allen’s mind jumped around to many ideas, Gates was someone who really obsessed over one thing at a time.

This story about Gates’s intense focus supports my argument for deep work. In today’s fast-changing world, it’s easy to complain about how distracted we are. Some people worry about how much time others spend on their phones and miss the days when we could concentrate without interruptions. On the other hand, some digital enthusiasts think that longing for the past is boring and believe that being more connected will lead to a better future. Marshall McLuhan said, “the medium is the message,” but now it seems like people think “the medium is morality”—you either support the future of social media or see it as a problem.

As I mentioned in the introduction of this book, I’m not interested in this debate. Committing to deep work isn’t about morals or philosophy; it’s about recognizing that being able to concentrate is a skill that helps you accomplish important things. Deep work matters not because distractions are bad, but because it helped Bill Gates create a billion-dollar industry in less than a year.
