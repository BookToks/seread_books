Your brain can actually remember a lot of detailed stuff if you store it the right way. Ron White has a cool technique for memorizing cards that takes advantage of this idea.

First, he suggests that you picture yourself walking through five rooms in your house. Imagine you come in the front door, walk through the hallway, go into the bathroom, then the guest bedroom, the kitchen, and finally down to the basement. Try to clearly picture everything you see in each room.

Once you can easily remember this mental tour, think of ten big items in each room. White says to pick things that are easy to remember, like a desk instead of a pencil. Then, decide the order in which you’ll look at these items. For example, in the hallway, you might look at the entry mat first, then the shoes by it, and then the bench above the shoes. That gives you fifty items, but you need two more, so maybe add a couple of things from your backyard to reach fifty-two, which is how many cards are in a deck.

Practice walking through these rooms and looking at the items in the order you set. This way of memorizing is easier because it uses visual images of places and things you know well, unlike the boring memorization you might have done in school.

The next step is to connect a memorable person or thing to each of the fifty-two cards. Try to make a logical link between the card and the image. For example, you could think of Donald Trump for the King of Diamonds since diamonds represent wealth. Keep practicing these connections until you can randomly pull a card and instantly remember the image linked to it. Using memorable visuals makes it easier to remember.

The first two steps are things you only need to do once, and then you can use them over and over to memorize different decks. Once you’ve done that, you’re ready for the main challenge: memorizing the order of fifty-two cards in a shuffled deck as quickly as possible. Start your mental walk through your house again. As you see each item, look at the next card from the shuffled deck and imagine the person or thing you associated with that card doing something memorable near that item.
