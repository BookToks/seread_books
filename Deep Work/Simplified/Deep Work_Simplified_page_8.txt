I don’t really have a strong opinion about this big debate. What I care about more is how our work culture is changing. It’s becoming more shallow, and whether that’s good or bad, it’s creating a huge chance for people who see the value in going deeper. A great example is a young consultant from Virginia named Jason Benn.

There are many ways to find out that you’re not really needed in today’s job market. For Jason, it hit him when he realized that most of his tasks as a financial consultant could be done by a simple Excel script. 

The company he worked for made reports for banks involved in complicated deals. Jason joked that the job was as boring as it sounds. Creating these reports took hours of manual work in Excel. When he started, it took him up to six hours to finish one report, while the fastest workers could do it in about three hours. This frustrated him.

Jason thought the whole process was clunky and too hands-on. He knew about a feature in Excel called macros that could automate tasks. After reading some articles, he created a new worksheet using these macros. This changed the six-hour job into something he could do with just a click. What used to take him a full day now took less than an hour.

Jason is really smart. He graduated from a top college, the University of Virginia, with a degree in economics, and like many people, he had big dreams for his career. But he quickly realized that if his main skills could be done by an Excel macro, he wouldn’t get far. So, he decided he needed to become more valuable. After some research, he told his family he would quit his job and learn to be a computer programmer. The problem was, Jason didn’t know how to code at all.

As someone who knows about computers, I can tell you that programming is tough. Most new developers spend four years in college learning how to do it, and even then, it’s super competitive to get the best jobs. Jason didn’t have that kind of time. After realizing he needed a change, he quit his job and moved back home to get ready for his next step. His parents were happy he was making a change.
