Before we get into the details, let’s talk about a popular idea for dealing with being addicted to distractions: the Internet Sabbath (also called a digital detox). Basically, this means taking a break from technology for a certain time—usually one day a week—where you don’t use the internet. Just like the Sabbath in the Hebrew Bible is a time for peace and thinking about God, the Internet Sabbath is meant to help you realize what you miss when you’re always staring at a screen.

We’re not sure who came up with the idea of the Internet Sabbath, but a journalist named William Powers helped make it popular in his 2010 book, Hamlet’s BlackBerry. In an interview, Powers said, “Do what Thoreau did, which is learn to have a little disconnectedness within the connected world—don’t run away.”

A lot of advice about dealing with distractions follows this idea of taking breaks. Some people take a month or two off from technology each year, while others follow Powers’s advice of taking one day a week off. Some even take an hour or two each day to unplug. All of these ideas can help a bit, but when we think about how our brains work, it’s clear that just doing an Internet Sabbath won’t fix a distracted brain. If you only eat healthy food one day a week, you probably won’t lose weight because the rest of the week you’re eating junk. The same goes for distractions; if you only take one day off from them, you probably won’t stop your brain from craving them since you’re giving in most of the time.

I have another idea instead of the Internet Sabbath. Instead of planning breaks from distractions to help you focus, try planning breaks from focusing so you can enjoy distractions. To make this clearer, let’s say using the internet means you’re looking for distractions. (You can use the internet in a focused way, but that’s tough for someone who’s addicted to distractions.) Also, let’s say working without the internet means you’re more focused. (You can find distractions without the internet, but it’s usually easier to resist them.)

With these ideas in mind, here’s the plan: decide in advance when you’ll use the internet, and then stay away from it at other times. I suggest keeping a notepad near your computer at work. On this pad,
