“Hey, do you want to grab coffee?”

Email #2: “Let’s get back to that research problem we talked about last time. Where are we with that?”

Email #3: “I worked on that article we talked about. It’s attached. What do you think?”

These three emails are pretty common for people who work with information. They show the kind of messages that fill up our inboxes. But they can also be tricky: how you reply can really affect how much time and focus the conversation takes from you.

When you get emails like these, you might feel the urge to quickly reply just to get them out of your inbox. A fast response might feel good for a moment because it shifts the responsibility back to the sender. But that relief doesn’t last long, as the responsibility keeps coming back to you, taking up your time and focus. So, it’s better to pause before replying and think about this important question: What project is this email about, and what’s the best way to handle it so we can finish it efficiently?

Once you’ve thought about this, instead of sending a quick reply, take the time to explain the process you figured out, mention what step you’re on, and highlight what needs to happen next. I call this the process-centric approach to email, and it helps reduce the number of emails you get and the mental stress they cause.

To show how this works, here are some process-centric replies to the earlier emails:

Process-Centric Response to Email #1: “I’d love to grab coffee! Let’s meet at the Starbucks on campus. Here are two days next week when I’m free, with three times for each day. If any of those work for you, let me know, and I’ll take your reply as a confirmation. If not, call me at the number below, and we can figure out a time. Looking forward to it!”

Process-Centric Response to Email #2: “I agree we should get back to this problem. Here’s what I suggest…”
