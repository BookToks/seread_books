“Hey, do you want to grab coffee?”

Email #2: “We should talk about the research problem we discussed last time I was here. Can you remind me where we left off?”

Email #3: “I worked on that article we talked about. It’s attached. What do you think?”

These examples are pretty common for people who work with information. They show the kind of messages that fill up our inboxes. But they can also be tricky: how you reply can really affect how much time and focus the conversation takes up.

When you get emails like these, your first instinct might be to quickly reply just to get them out of your inbox. A fast reply might feel good at first because it shifts the responsibility back to the sender. But this relief doesn’t last long because the responsibility will just keep coming back, taking up more of your time and energy. 

So, I suggest that instead of rushing to reply, take a moment to think about this important question: What project is this email about, and what’s the best way to handle it so we can finish it efficiently?

Once you’ve thought about that, instead of a quick reply, send a response that explains the process you figured out, mentions where you are now, and highlights what needs to happen next. I call this the process-centric approach to email, and it helps reduce the number of emails you get and the mental clutter they create.

To show how this works, here’s a process-centric reply to the first email: “I’d love to grab coffee! Let’s meet at the Starbucks on campus. Here are two days next week when I’m free, with three times for each day. If any of those work for you, just let me know, and I’ll take that as a confirmation. If none of those times work, call me at the number below, and we can figure out a time that does. Looking forward to it!”

And here’s a process-centric reply to the second email: “I agree we should go back to this problem. Here’s what I suggest…”
