All of my time and attention are already taken up—many times over. So please don’t ask for them.

To explain why he doesn’t respond to messages much, Stephenson wrote an essay called “Why I Am a Bad Correspondent.” The main reason he gives for being hard to reach is this: 

Being productive isn’t a simple thing. This is why he doesn’t reply to emails often and rarely speaks at events. If he sets up his life to have long, uninterrupted time, he can write novels. But if that time gets broken up, he can’t write as well or as fast.

Stephenson sees two choices: He can write good novels regularly, or he can spend time answering emails and going to conferences, which would slow down his writing and lower its quality. He picked the first choice, which means he tries to avoid distractions in his work life. This idea is so important to him that he even wrote about it in his 2008 sci-fi book, Anathem, where smart people live away from distractions and technology to think deeply.

From my experience, this way of thinking makes many people in knowledge jobs defensive. Those who strongly believe in it know their value clearly, which might bother others whose jobs are more complicated. Just because a job is “more complicated” doesn’t mean it’s less important. For example, a high-level manager is crucial for a big company, even if she can’t show a specific project like a finished novel to prove her work. So, not everyone fits into this way of thinking, and that’s fine. If you don’t fit, don’t be too jealous of it. But if you do fit—if your work is clear and individual—then you should really think about this philosophy. It might be the key to having a memorable career.
