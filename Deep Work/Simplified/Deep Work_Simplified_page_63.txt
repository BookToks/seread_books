All my time and attention are already taken up—way too much. So please don’t ask for them.

To explain why he’s hard to reach, Stephenson wrote an essay called “Why I Am a Bad Correspondent.” The main reason he can’t be available is because of how productivity works. He says that if he can have long, uninterrupted time to work, he can write great novels. But if that time gets broken up, he can’t write as well or as fast.

Stephenson believes he has two choices: He can write good novels regularly, or he can spend a lot of time replying to emails and going to events, which would make his novels worse and take longer to finish. He picked the first choice, which means he tries to avoid anything that distracts him from his writing. This idea is so important to him that he even wrote a science fiction book called *Anathem*, which imagines a world where smart people live away from distractions to think deeply.

From what I’ve seen, this way of thinking can make some people defensive. Those who really know their value might feel uneasy about others whose work is more complicated. Just because someone’s work is complicated doesn’t mean it’s less important. For example, a high-level manager is crucial to a big company, even if she can’t show a finished project like a book and say, “This is what I did this year.” So, not everyone can follow this simple way of thinking, and that’s fine. If you’re not part of that group, don’t feel jealous. But if you are someone whose work is clear and specific, you should think about this philosophy seriously, as it could make a big difference in your career.
