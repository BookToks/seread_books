Try this experiment no more than once a week at first. This way, you can train your brain to focus hard but also give it time to chill out in between. Once you feel good about switching your focus for finishing tasks faster, you can do these Roosevelt dashes more often. Just remember to set deadlines that are challenging but still possible to meet. You should be able to finish just in time or really close, but it should take a lot of focus.

The main reason for this method is pretty simple. Deep work needs way more focus than most people are used to. Roosevelt dashes use fake deadlines to help you gradually improve your focus, almost like training your brain. Plus, these dashes don’t allow for distractions. If you want to meet your deadlines, you can’t get sidetracked. So, every time you finish a dash, you might feel bored and want to look for something more exciting, but you hold back. As mentioned before, the more you practice ignoring those urges, the easier it gets.

After a few months of using this method, you’ll probably understand what it means to really focus in a whole new way. You’ll reach levels of concentration that are stronger than anything you’ve felt before. And if you’re like a young Roosevelt, you can use the extra time you have to enjoy the nicer things in life, like impressing the picky members of the Nuttall Ornithological Club.

During the two years I worked at MIT, my wife and I lived in a small but nice apartment in Beacon Hill. Even though I worked in Cambridge and lived in Boston, they were really close—only a mile apart, separated by the Charles River. To stay fit during the cold New England winter, I decided to walk to work as much as I could. 

My routine was to walk to campus in the morning, crossing the Longfellow Bridge no matter the weather (which was annoying because the city was slow to clear the sidewalks after snowstorms). At lunchtime, I would change into my running clothes and run back home on a longer route along the river.
