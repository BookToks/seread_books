The Adirondacks is a place where Roosevelt spent his summer after his first year of college. His work about birds was published in a serious bird magazine, and it impressed people enough for them to think he was one of the smartest young nature lovers in the country.

To keep up with his bird studies, Roosevelt had to cut back on his main focus: his schoolwork at Harvard. A guy named Morris looked at Roosevelt's diary and letters from that time and figured out that Roosevelt was only studying about a quarter of the day. You might think his grades would drop because of this, but they didn’t. He wasn’t the best student, but he did well, earning honors in five out of seven of his classes during his freshman year. 

The reason for this surprising success is how Roosevelt managed his time. He planned his day from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and took out the hours for classes, sports practice, and lunch. The leftover time was what he used for studying. Even though he didn’t have a lot of hours, he made the most of them by focusing only on schoolwork during those times. Morris said that even though Roosevelt spent less time at his desk, he was super focused and read really fast, which meant he could take more breaks than most students.

This strategy encourages you to work like Roosevelt did. Find a big task that you really need to finish and guess how long it usually takes you. Then, set a tight deadline that gives you less time to do it. If you can, tell someone else about the deadline to keep yourself accountable. If you can’t do that, set a countdown timer on your phone and keep it where you can see it while you work.

To get the task done on time, you need to work really hard—no checking emails, daydreaming, or scrolling through social media. Just like Roosevelt at Harvard, focus all your energy on the task until it’s finished.
