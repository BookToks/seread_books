The Adirondacks in the summer after his freshman year was a big deal. It got a lot of praise in the Bulletin of the Nuttall Ornithological Club, which is a serious bird magazine. Because of this, Morris thought Roosevelt was “one of the most knowledgeable young naturalists in the United States” at such a young age.

To keep up with his bird interests, Roosevelt had to cut back on studying at Harvard, which should have been his main focus. Morris looked at Roosevelt’s diary and letters from that time and figured out that he was only spending about a quarter of his day on schoolwork. You might think this would mean his grades would drop, but they didn’t. He wasn’t the best student, but he did pretty well: in his freshman year, he got honor grades in five out of seven classes. 

The reason for this surprising success was how Roosevelt handled his schoolwork. He planned his day from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and took out the time for classes, sports practice, and lunch. What was left was his study time. Even though this time wasn’t a lot, he made it count by focusing only on schoolwork during those hours and working really hard. Morris said, “The amount of time he spent at his desk was comparatively small, but his concentration was so intense, and his reading so rapid, that he could afford more time off than most.”

You can use Roosevelt’s intense approach in your own life. First, find a big task that you need to get done. Figure out how much time you usually need for it, then set a tight deadline that cuts that time down a lot. If you can, tell someone else about the deadline to keep yourself accountable. If that’s not possible, set a countdown timer on your phone and place it where you can see it while you work.

To finish the task on time, you need to work really hard—no checking email, no daydreaming, no scrolling through social media, and no extra trips for snacks. Like Roosevelt at Harvard, focus all your energy on the task until you get it done.
