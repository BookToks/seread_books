Workers aren't just slacking off. They say they're busier than ever. So, what's going on? A lot of it has to do with another kind of work that’s different from deep work:

Shallow Work: These are tasks that don’t require much thinking and are often done while distracted. They usually don’t create much new value and are easy for anyone to do.

Nowadays, many knowledge workers are replacing deep work with shallow tasks. They spend a lot of time sending and receiving emails, like busy routers, and take frequent breaks for quick distractions. Bigger projects that need deep thinking, like coming up with a new business plan or writing an important application, get broken down into short, distracted bursts that don’t produce great results.

To make things worse, there’s growing evidence that this shift to shallow work isn’t something we can easily change back. If you spend too much time in this distracted state, it can actually lower your ability to focus on deep work. Journalist Nicholas Carr talked about this in a well-known 2008 article, saying that the Internet seems to be ruining our ability to concentrate. He’s not alone in feeling this way.

Carr even wrote a book called The Shallows, which was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. To write it, he had to go to a cabin and disconnect from everything. 

The idea that online tools are pushing us away from deep work isn’t new. The Shallows was just the first of many books looking at how the Internet affects our brains and work habits. Other books like Hamlet’s BlackBerry, The Tyranny of E-mail, and The Distraction Addiction all agree that these tools are distracting us from work that needs our full attention and are making it harder to stay focused.

Since there’s already a lot of evidence about this, I won’t spend more time proving it in this book. I hope we can agree that network tools hurt our ability to do deep work. I’ll also skip big debates about the long-term effects of this change, as they often lead to arguments. Some people, like Jaron Lanier and John Freeman, think these tools harm society, while others, like Clive Thompson, believe they’re changing society for the better. For example, Google might make us forgetful, but we can instantly look up anything we need to know.
