To learn something new without getting distracted, you need to focus really hard. This helps your brain connect the right neurons, which is important for learning. If you’re trying to learn something complicated, like how to manage a database, but you’re not paying full attention (like if you’re scrolling through Facebook), your brain gets confused. It fires too many neurons at once, and you can’t strengthen the ones you actually need.

Over the last hundred years, people have talked about focusing your mind like a lens to pay attention better. Now, we understand it in a more scientific way, involving special brain cells called oligodendrocytes. The bottom line is this: to learn difficult things quickly, you have to concentrate hard and avoid distractions. Learning is serious work. If you can handle this deep focus, you’ll be able to master the complex skills needed to succeed today. But if you find it hard to focus and get distracted easily, don’t expect to learn these skills quickly.

Deep work is what helps you achieve great things. Adam Grant is a perfect example of this. When I met him in 2013, he was the youngest professor to get tenure at the Wharton School of Business. A year later, he became the youngest full professor there.

The reason Grant moved up so fast is simple: he gets things done. In 2012, he published seven articles in big journals, which is really impressive for his field where professors usually work alone or in small groups. In 2013, he published five articles, which is still a lot, but a bit less than before. He can be forgiven for this drop because he also published a book called *Give and Take* that year, which made his research on business relationships popular. Saying the book was successful is an understatement; it was featured on the cover of the *New York Times Magazine* and became a huge bestseller. By the time he became a full professor in 2014, he had already written over sixty research papers and his bestselling book.
