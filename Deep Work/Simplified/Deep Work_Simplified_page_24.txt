If you want to learn something new really well, you need to focus hard and avoid distractions. This is the best way to help your brain strengthen the right connections. For example, if you're trying to learn something complicated like SQL database management but you're also scrolling through Facebook, your brain is too busy to focus on what you really need to learn.

A long time ago, a guy named Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges talked about using your mind like a lens to focus your attention. Today, we understand this better with science about brain cells called oligodendrocytes. The main idea is clear: to learn difficult things quickly, you have to concentrate deeply without getting distracted. If you're good at focusing, you'll be better at mastering the complicated skills needed to succeed today. But if you struggle with focusing and get distracted easily, learning those skills won't be easy.

Deep work is what helps you achieve great results. Adam Grant is a perfect example of this. When I met him in 2013, he was the youngest professor to get tenure at the Wharton School of Business. By the time I started writing this chapter, he had become the youngest full professor there.

The reason Adam got ahead so quickly is simple: he gets a lot done. In 2012, he published seven articles in major journals, which is a huge amount for his field. In 2013, he published five articles, which is still impressive, but he was also busy with his book, *Give and Take*. This book became really popular and was even featured on the cover of the *New York Times Magazine*. By the time he became a full professor in 2014, he had written over sixty research papers and his bestselling book.
