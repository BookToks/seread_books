Shutdown rituals can be a bit annoying because they add an extra ten to fifteen minutes to the end of your workday, and sometimes even more. But they are important for helping you relax and enjoy your free time. From what I've seen, it usually takes about a week or two for this habit to stick. That means your brain needs time to trust the routine enough to let go of work thoughts in the evening. Once it becomes a habit, it will be a regular part of your life, and skipping it will make you feel uneasy.

Many studies in psychology show that taking breaks helps your brain work better. When you work, give it your all. When you’re done, really be done. Your response time to emails might slow down a bit, but you’ll make up for it by getting more important work done during the day because you’ll be able to focus better than others who are tired.
