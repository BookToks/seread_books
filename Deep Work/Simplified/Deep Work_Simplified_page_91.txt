Shutdown rituals can be a bit annoying because they add an extra ten to fifteen minutes to the end of your workday, and sometimes even more. But they are important for helping you relax and enjoy your free time. From what I’ve seen, it usually takes about a week or two for this habit to really stick. That means your brain needs time to trust the routine so it can let go of work thoughts in the evening. Once it becomes a habit, you’ll feel weird if you skip it.

Many studies in psychology show that taking regular breaks helps you do better work. When you work, put in your best effort. When you’re done, really be done. Sure, you might take a bit longer to reply to emails, but you’ll get way more important stuff done during the day because you’ll be more focused and less tired than others.
