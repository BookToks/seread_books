university,” she starts, explaining how she chose to ignore what everyone usually says and instead “intentionally… do specific things to keep myself happy.” This effort helped Nagpal really enjoy her time before getting tenure.

She shares a few examples of what she did, but one method stands out. In the beginning of her academic career, Nagpal was trying to squeeze work into every free moment from seven in the morning to midnight. Since she has kids, her evenings were often really hectic. It didn’t take long for her to realize this wasn’t going to work, so she decided to limit herself to fifty hours of work each week. Then, she figured out what rules and habits she needed to stick to this limit. Basically, she used a fixed schedule to be productive.

This strategy clearly worked for her because she got tenure on time and became a full professor just three years later, which is pretty impressive. How did she do it? In her article, she mentions that one of her main techniques was to set strict limits on the less important tasks in her academic life. For instance, she decided to only travel five times a year for any reason. Traveling can create a lot of urgent but not very important tasks, like booking hotels or preparing presentations. While five trips might still seem like a lot, it’s actually pretty light for someone in academia. To put this in perspective, Matt Welsh, a former coworker of Nagpal at Harvard, once said that new professors usually travel twelve to twenty-four times a year. Just think about how much time and effort Nagpal saved by avoiding those extra trips! The travel limit is just one of the ways she managed her workday; she also limited the number of papers she would review each year. All her strategies focused on cutting down on the less important stuff while protecting her time for deep, meaningful research that really mattered for her career.

In my own experience, I also stick to a similar approach to succeed with fixed scheduling. I’m super careful about saying “yes” to things that lead to shallow work. It takes a lot for me to agree to something that isn’t really necessary. If someone asks me to get involved in university stuff that isn’t crucial, I might say something like, “Talk to me after tenure.” Another trick that works for me is to be clear when I say no but not go into too much detail about why. The key is to avoid giving too much information about my refusal.
