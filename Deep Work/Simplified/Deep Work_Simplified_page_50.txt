life,” Gallagher wraps up in her book. “I’ll pick my goals carefully… then focus on them completely. Basically, I’ll live a focused life because it’s the best way to live.” We should take her advice.

A Psychological Argument for Depth

The second reason why focusing deeply on things brings meaning comes from a famous psychologist named Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. In the early 1980s, he worked with a younger colleague, Reed Larson, at the University of Chicago. Together, they created a new way to understand how everyday activities affect our minds. Back then, it was hard to measure how different activities impacted our feelings. If you asked someone in a lab to remember how they felt hours ago, they probably wouldn’t remember well. If you gave them a diary to write down their feelings throughout the day, they likely wouldn’t keep it up because it was too much work.

Csikszentmihalyi and Larson had a breakthrough by using new technology for that time. They gave people pagers that would beep at random times (nowadays, we use smartphone apps for this). When the pager beeped, the participants would write down what they were doing and how they felt at that moment. Sometimes, they wrote in a journal, and other times, they called a number to answer questions from a researcher. Since the beeps were random but hard to ignore, people were more likely to respond. Because they recorded their feelings right when they were doing something, the answers were more accurate. Csikszentmihalyi and Larson called this method the experience sampling method (ESM), and it gave us new insights into how we feel in our daily lives.

One of the big discoveries from Csikszentmihalyi’s work with ESM supported a theory he had been developing for ten years: “The best moments happen when a person’s mind or body is pushed to its limits while trying to achieve something challenging and meaningful.” He named this mental state “flow,” a term he made popular in a book he wrote in 1990. At that time, this finding went against what most people believed. Many thought that relaxing was the key to happiness. We often want to work less and chill more.
