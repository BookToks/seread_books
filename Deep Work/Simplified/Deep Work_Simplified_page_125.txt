Luckily, Arnold Bennett figured out a solution to this problem a hundred years ago: 

Think more about how you spend your free time. 

This means that when you want to relax, don’t just go for whatever looks interesting at the moment. Instead, take some time to think about how you want to spend your “day within a day.” Websites that can be super addictive thrive when you have nothing else to do. If you don’t have a plan, they will always seem like a fun choice. But if you fill your free time with better activities, you won’t feel as drawn to them.

So, it’s really important to decide in advance what you’ll do with your evenings and weekends before they start. Hobbies that have structure are great for this because they give you specific things to do and goals to reach. For example, setting a reading schedule, like Bennett suggests, where you read a few chosen books regularly each night is a good idea. Exercise or hanging out with friends in person are also great options.

In my own life, I manage to read a lot of books each year, even with my busy schedule as a professor, writer, and dad. I usually read three to five books at a time. I do this because one of my favorite things to do after my kids go to bed is read a good book. Because of this, I often ignore my smartphone and computer from the end of the workday until the next morning.

You might be worried that making plans for your relaxation will take away from the whole point of chilling out, which many people think means having no plans at all. Will having a structured evening make you tired instead of refreshed for work the next day? Bennett thought about this concern. He said that these worries don’t really understand what gives us energy. 

He argued that using your energy during your free time actually makes your work time more valuable. He believed that our minds can handle a lot of activity without getting tired like our bodies do. What they really need is change—not rest, except when we sleep.

From my experience, he’s totally right. If you keep your mind busy with meaningful things all day, you’ll feel more satisfied at the end of the day and start the next one feeling more relaxed than if you just let your mind wander aimlessly.
