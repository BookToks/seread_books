a long time in mindless scrolling or random distractions.

Arnold Bennett figured out a way to make our free time better a hundred years ago. He said we should think more about how we relax. Instead of just doing whatever seems fun at the moment, we should plan how we want to spend our time off. Websites that can easily suck you in work best when you have nothing else to do. If you fill your free time with better activities, you won’t be as tempted by those distractions.

It’s important to decide what you want to do with your evenings and weekends before they start. Hobbies that have a clear goal can help fill your time well. For example, you could set a plan to read certain books regularly or spend time exercising or hanging out with friends. In my life, I manage to read a lot of books each year, even with my busy schedule as a professor, writer, and dad. I usually read three to five books at once because I like to read after my kids go to bed. This way, I don’t spend my evenings on my phone or computer.

You might think that planning your relaxation could make it feel less relaxing. Some people believe that to relax, you need to have no plans at all. They worry that having a schedule will leave you tired instead of refreshed for work the next day. But Bennett thought about this concern. He believed that using your mind actively during your free time actually makes you feel better and more energized. He said our brains can handle a lot of activity without getting tired like our bodies do. What they really need is a change of pace, not just rest.

From my experience, he’s right. If you keep your mind busy with meaningful activities during the day, you’ll feel more satisfied at the end of it. You’ll also start the next day feeling more relaxed than if you just spent your time mindlessly scrolling.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** Arnold Bennett suggested that we should plan our leisure time to make it more fulfilling. Instead of mindlessly scrolling, we should engage in meaningful activities like reading or hobbies. This approach helps us feel more satisfied and relaxed overall.
