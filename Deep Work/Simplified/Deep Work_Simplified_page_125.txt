a long time in mindless scrolling or random distractions.

So, Arnold Bennett figured out a way to make our free time better a hundred years ago. He said we should think more about how we spend our leisure time. Instead of just doing whatever seems fun at the moment, we should plan how we want to use our “day within a day.” Websites that can be super distracting thrive when we have nothing else to do. If we fill our free time with better activities, we won’t feel as drawn to those distractions.

It’s really important to decide what you want to do on your evenings and weekends before they start. Hobbies that have structure are great for this because they give you specific things to do. For example, you could set a goal to read a certain number of books or spend time exercising or hanging out with friends. 

In my life, I manage to read a lot of books each year, even though I’m busy with work and family. I usually read three to five books at a time because I plan to read after my kids go to bed. Because of this, I don’t spend much time on my phone or computer during the evening.

You might think that planning your relaxation time could make it feel less relaxing. Some people believe that to relax, you need to have no plans at all. They worry that having a structured evening will leave you tired the next day. But Bennett thought about this too. He believed that using your mind actively during your free time actually makes you feel more energized and ready for the next day. 

From my experience, he’s right. If you keep your mind busy with meaningful activities all day, you’ll feel more satisfied at night and wake up feeling more relaxed.
