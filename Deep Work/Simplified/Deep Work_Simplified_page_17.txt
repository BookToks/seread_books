Workers are facing big changes because of technology. Things like robots and voice recognition are taking over many simple jobs. But other tech, like data visualization and fast communication, is making jobs that need more thinking and data skills even more valuable. Basically, if you can work well with smart machines, you’ll do great. Tyler Cowen puts it simply: “The big question is: can you work with smart machines or not?”

Nate Silver is a great example of someone who excels in this new world. He’s really good at using data and running complex simulations, which makes him a top worker. For him, smart machines aren’t a problem; they’re actually what helps him succeed.

Now, let’s talk about the “superstars.” David Heinemeier Hansson is a top programmer who shows how some people will really shine in this new economy. With fast internet and tools like email and video calls, companies don’t need to hire full-time workers anymore. Instead of hiring someone for a full-time job, they can just pay a top programmer like Hansson for the time needed to finish a project. This way, companies get better results for less money, and Hansson can work with more clients and make more money.

It doesn’t matter if Hansson is working from Spain while your office is in Iowa. Thanks to technology, it feels like they’re in the same room. But this is tough for local programmers in Iowa who need steady jobs. This trend is happening in many fields where people can work remotely, like consulting, marketing, writing, and design. When talent can come from anywhere, the best workers do really well, while others struggle.

In a famous paper from 1981, economist Sherwin Rosen explained how these “winner-take-all” markets work. He pointed out that talent isn’t the same for everyone. He said that just hearing a bunch of average singers doesn’t add up to one amazing performance.
