Workers today are facing big changes because of new technology. Things like robots and voice recognition are taking over many simple jobs. But other tech, like data visualization and fast communication, is making jobs that need more thinking and data skills even more important. Basically, if you can work well with smart machines, you’ll do great. Tyler Cowen puts it simply: “The key question will be: are you good at working with intelligent machines or not?”

Nate Silver is a great example of someone who excels in this new world. He’s really good at using data and running complex simulations, which helps him succeed. For him, smart machines are not a problem; they actually help him do better.

Then there are the “superstars,” like David Heinemeier Hansson, who are also expected to do well in this economy. With fast internet and tools for working together online, companies don’t need to hire full-time workers anymore. Instead, they can hire top programmers like Hansson just for the time they need to finish a project. This way, companies get better results for less money, and Hansson can work with more clients, making him better off too.

It doesn’t matter if Hansson is working from Spain while the company is in Iowa. Thanks to technology, they can work together easily. But this change is tough for local programmers in Iowa who need steady jobs. This trend is happening in many fields like consulting, marketing, writing, and design. When everyone can access talent from anywhere, the best workers do really well, while others struggle.

In a famous paper from 1981, economist Sherwin Rosen explained how these “winner-take-all” markets work. He pointed out that talent is unique and can’t easily be replaced. For example, listening to a bunch of average singers doesn’t compare to hearing one amazing performance.
