In the United States, there are three types of professors: assistant, associate, and full. 

Most people start as assistant professors. After a while, if they do a good job, they can become associate professors when they get tenure. 

Becoming a full professor takes a lot of time and effort after getting tenure, and not everyone reaches that level.
