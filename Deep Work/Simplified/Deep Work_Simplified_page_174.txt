In the United States, there are three levels of professors: assistant, associate, and full. Most people start as assistant professors. After a while, if they do a good job, they can become associate professors when they get tenure. 

Becoming a full professor takes a long time and a lot of hard work after getting tenure, and not everyone makes it to that level.
