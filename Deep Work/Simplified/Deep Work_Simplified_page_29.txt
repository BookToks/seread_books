There are two companies where the leaders have a lifestyle that keeps them distracted. For example, Kerry Trainor, the CEO of Vimeo, said he can go most of a Saturday without checking his email, but he still looks at it. 

These executives earn a lot of money and are very important in today's economy. Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter, is another example of someone who is successful without focusing deeply on one thing. However, just because they can work this way doesn’t mean that deep thinking isn’t important. 

The reason these executives are distracted is because of their specific jobs. A good CEO needs to make quick decisions based on their experience and knowledge. They get a lot of information throughout the day, like emails and meetings, that they need to handle. If a CEO spent four hours thinking about one problem, it wouldn’t be the best use of their time. Instead, it’s smarter to have a few smart team members think deeply about the issue and then present their ideas to the CEO for a final choice.

This is important to remember because if you’re a high-level executive, the advice in this book might not apply to you. Just because Dorsey and Trainor work this way doesn’t mean it will work for everyone else. Their habits are specific to their roles in big companies.

We should also think about other jobs where deep thinking isn’t as valued, like some salespeople and lobbyists who need to stay connected all the time. Some people can still succeed while being distracted, even if deep work would help them. 

But don’t rush to say your job can’t involve deep thinking. Just because it’s hard to focus deeply right now doesn’t mean it’s not possible to do your job well. In the next chapter, I will explain more about this.
