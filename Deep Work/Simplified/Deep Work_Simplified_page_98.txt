When you plan to use the Internet after work, it’s okay to check important messages, like texting a friend about dinner plans or looking up a restaurant's location. But during your offline time, put your phone away, ignore texts, and don’t go online. If you enjoy using the Internet for fun in the evening, that’s cool too—just make sure to set aside specific times for it. The goal isn’t to cut down on how much time you spend on distractions, but to give yourself chances to resist them when you feel bored.

One tough spot for this plan is when you have to wait, like in line at a store. In these moments, if you’re offline, try to embrace the boredom and just think. Being bored is rare these days, but it can actually help you focus better in the long run. 

To sum it up, if you want to do deep work, you need to train your brain to ignore distractions. You don’t have to get rid of distractions completely; just make sure they don’t take over your attention. The idea of scheduling Internet time can really help you take back control of your focus.

If you went to Harvard in 1876-1877, you might have met a young guy named Theodore Roosevelt. He was full of energy and had a ton of interests, like boxing, wrestling, and even poetry. But even though he seemed scattered, he was really passionate about everything he did, including his love for nature, which led him to write his first book about birds.
