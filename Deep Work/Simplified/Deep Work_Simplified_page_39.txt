A lot of people who work with knowledge, like in offices, want to show they’re doing a good job. But they often aren’t sure what that really means. Unlike people who can point to clear achievements, like fixing a motorcycle, knowledge workers don’t have obvious signs of success. To deal with this confusion, many are looking back to the old days of factories when productivity was easy to measure.

Back then, with assembly lines, there was a big focus on efficiency. A guy named Frederic Taylor even used a stopwatch to see how fast workers could do their tasks. In his time, productivity was simple: it was about how many items were made in a certain time. Nowadays, many knowledge workers feel lost and are trying to measure their worth using this old idea of productivity. Some, like David Allen, even talk about “cranking widgets” to describe getting work done. Knowledge workers are becoming more visibly busy because they don’t know how else to show their value. We can call this trend "Busyness as Proxy for Productivity."

Since there aren’t clear signs of being productive, many knowledge workers fall back on being busy and doing lots of visible tasks. This explains why some people are always sending emails, attending meetings, or quickly responding to messages. They think that if they look busy, it shows they’re doing their job well. This way of thinking isn’t totally crazy. For some jobs, being busy really is important. For example, in 2013, Yahoo’s CEO Marissa Mayer stopped employees from working from home after noticing that those at home weren’t as active on the company’s network.
