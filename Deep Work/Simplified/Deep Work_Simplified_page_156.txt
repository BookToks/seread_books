Notes

Introduction

“In my retiring room”; “I keep the key”; and “The feeling of rest and refreshment”: Jung, Carl. Memories, Dreams, Reflections. Translated by Richard Winston. New York: Pantheon, 1963.

“Even though he had many patients” and other details about artists’ routines: Currey, Mason. Daily Rituals: How Artists Work. New York: Knopf, 2013.

The timeline of Jung’s life and work helped me understand how deep work was important in his career: Cowgill, Charles. “Carl Jung.” May 1997. http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/jung.htm.

Anders Ericsson from Florida State University studies how practice makes perfect. He has a good explanation of this idea on his academic website: http://www.psy.fsu.edu/faculty/ericsson/ericsson.exp.perf.html.

My list of deep work habits from famous people comes from these sources:

- Montaigne info is from: Bakewell, Sarah. How to Live: Or A Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer. New York: Other Press, 2010.
- Mark Twain info is from: Mason Currey’s Daily Rituals.
- Woody Allen info is from Robert Weide’s 2011 documentary, Woody Allen: A Documentary.
- Peter Higgs info is from: Sample, Ian. “Peter Higgs Proves as Elusive as Higgs Boson after Nobel Success.” Guardian, October 9, 2013, http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/08/nobel-laureate-peter-higgs-boson-elusive.

“A 2012 McKinsey study found that”: Chui, Michael, et al. “The Social Economy: Unlocking Value and Productivity Through Social Technologies.” McKinsey Global Institute. July 2012. http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/the_social_economy.

The fact that Carr had to go to a cabin to finish writing The Shallows comes from the Author’s Note in the paperback version of the book.
