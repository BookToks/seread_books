You might need to understand how people work together and how projects really get done in a company. You might be thinking if a recent college grad needs to know a lot about the project topic. For a planning meeting, probably not. These meetings usually have a lot of small talk where people act like they’re really involved but aren’t actually doing much. Give a smart recent grad three months to learn everything, and they could easily fit in during these chats. So, we’ll say three months is a good time frame.

This question is just for thinking about things (I’m not saying you should actually hire a recent grad to do easy tasks). But the answers will help you see how deep or shallow different activities are. If our imaginary college grad needs a long time to learn a task, it shows that the task needs real skills. As mentioned before, tasks that need your skills are usually deeper and can give you more value for your time, plus help you get better at what you do. On the flip side, if a task is easy for the grad to pick up, it’s likely shallow and doesn’t need much expertise.

So, what should you do with this idea? Once you know which of your activities are deep or shallow, spend more time on the deep ones. Looking back at our examples, the first task is a good use of your time, while the second and third tasks should be done less. They might seem productive, but they don’t give you much back for the time you spend.

Of course, figuring out how to move away from shallow tasks and focus on deeper ones isn’t always easy, even if you know how to label your tasks. This leads us to the next strategies that will help you achieve this goal.

Ask your boss how much time you should spend on shallow work. This is an important question that doesn’t get asked often. If you have a boss, talk to them about it. You might need to explain what “shallow” and “deep” work mean. If you work for yourself, ask yourself the same question. In both cases, come up with a clear answer.
