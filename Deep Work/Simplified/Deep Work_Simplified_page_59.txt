Before we dive into some strategies, let’s talk about a question you might have: Why do we need complicated methods to focus better? Isn’t it enough to just try to do deep work more often? Sadly, it’s not that easy. To understand why, we need to look at one big problem: the temptation to focus on easier stuff instead of hard work. Most people know this temptation makes it hard to concentrate, but they don’t realize how often it happens or how strong it is.

In a 2012 study by psychologists Wilhelm Hofmann and Roy Baumeister, they gave 205 adults beepers that went off at random times. When the beeper rang, participants had to stop and think about their desires from the last thirty minutes and answer some questions about them. After a week, they collected over 7,500 responses. The main takeaway? People struggle with their desires all day long. As Baumeister pointed out in his book, "Willpower," having desires is normal, not unusual.

The top five desires people had included eating, sleeping, and sex. But they also wanted to take breaks from hard work, check emails, use social media, surf the web, listen to music, or watch TV. The pull of the Internet and TV was especially strong; participants could only resist these distractions about half the time.

This is not great news for anyone trying to build a deep work habit. It means you’ll face a lot of temptations to do anything except focus deeply throughout the day. If you’re like the people in the study, these distractions will often win. You might think you can do better because you know how important deep work is, but research shows that’s not easy. A lot of studies have shown that fighting these distractions is really tough.
