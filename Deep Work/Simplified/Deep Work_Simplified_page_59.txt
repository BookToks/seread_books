Before we get into some strategies, let’s talk about a question you might have: Why do we need such complicated methods? If we know that deep work is important, can’t we just do more of it? Do we really need something like the Eudaimonia Machine to help us remember to focus?

The truth is, switching from distractions to focus isn’t that easy. To understand why, let’s look at one major problem: the urge to pay attention to easier things. Most people know this urge makes it hard to concentrate, but they don’t realize how often and strong it really is.

In a 2012 study by psychologists Wilhelm Hofmann and Roy Baumeister, they gave 205 adults beepers that went off at random times. When the beeper went off, the person had to stop and think about any desires they felt in the last thirty minutes and answer some questions about them. After a week, they collected over 7,500 responses. The main finding was that people struggle with desires all day long. As Baumeister wrote in his book, Willpower, “Desire turned out to be the norm, not the exception.”

The top five desires people fought against included eating, sleeping, and sex. But they also really wanted to take breaks from hard work, check emails and social media, surf the web, listen to music, or watch TV. The pull of the Internet and TV was super strong; people could only resist these distractions about half the time.

This is not great news for anyone trying to build a deep work habit. It shows that you’ll face a lot of temptations to do anything but focus on your work. If you’re like the people in the study, those distractions will often win. You might think you can do better because you know how important it is to focus, but research shows that’s not easy. 

**PAGE SUMMARY:** Focusing on deep work is harder than it seems because distractions are everywhere. A study showed that people struggle with desires like checking social media or watching TV, making it tough to concentrate. Even if you understand the importance of deep work, resisting these urges is a real challenge.
