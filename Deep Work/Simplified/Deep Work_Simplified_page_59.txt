Before we get into some strategies, let’s talk about a question you might be wondering: Why do we need such complicated methods? If we know that deep work is important, can’t we just do more of it? Do we really need something as complex as the Eudaimonia Machine to help us focus better?

Unfortunately, switching from distractions to focus isn’t that easy. To understand why, let’s look at one big problem: the urge to pay attention to things that are less important. Most people know this urge makes it hard to concentrate on tough tasks, but they don’t realize how often it happens and how strong it can be.

Take a study from 2012 by psychologists Wilhelm Hofmann and Roy Baumeister. They gave 205 adults beepers that went off at random times. When the beeper rang, the person had to stop and think about any desires they had felt in the last thirty minutes and answer some questions about them. After a week, they collected over 7,500 responses. Here’s the main takeaway: People struggle with their desires all day long. As Baumeister said in his book, Willpower, “Desire turned out to be the norm, not the exception.”

The five most common desires people faced were pretty typical: eating, sleeping, and sex. But they also included wanting to take breaks from hard work, checking emails and social media, browsing the web, listening to music, or watching TV. The pull of the Internet and TV was especially strong; people could only resist these distractions about half the time.

This is bad news for anyone trying to build a deep work habit. It means you’ll likely feel the urge to do anything but focus on your work all day long. If you’re like the people in the study, those distractions will often win. You might think you’ll do better because you know how important it is to focus, but research shows that’s not enough. A lot of studies, including those by Baumeister, have shown that fighting these urges is really tough.
