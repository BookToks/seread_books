During a busy time in his career, a comic named Brad Isaac met Jerry Seinfeld at a club. Isaac was doing open mic nights and saw this as a chance to ask Seinfeld for advice. He later wrote about it, saying that what Seinfeld told him would help him for a long time.

Seinfeld started by saying that to be a better comic, you need to write better jokes. And to write better jokes, you should write every day. He shared a technique he used to keep himself on track: he kept a calendar on his wall. Every day he wrote jokes, he would mark that day with a big red X. 

He said, “After a few days, you’ll have a chain. Just keep going, and the chain will get longer every day. You’ll like seeing that chain, especially when you have a few weeks of it. Your only job is to not break the chain.” 

This method, called the chain method, became popular among writers and fitness fans who want to stick to their goals. It shows a way to make deep work a regular habit. The idea is to create a rhythm for this work so you don’t have to think about when to do it. The chain method is a good example because it’s simple: just do the work every day and use the big red Xs to remind yourself.

Another way to use this idea is to set a specific time each day for deep work. Just like seeing your progress can help you stay motivated, having a set time can make it easier to start working. 

For example, Brian Chappell, a busy student working on his doctoral thesis, used this method because he had to. He got a full-time job at his school while also having a new baby, which made it hard to find time to write his thesis chapters.
