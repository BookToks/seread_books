During a busy time in his career, a writer and comedian named Brad Isaac met Seinfeld at a club. Isaac was doing open mic nights and saw this as a chance to ask Seinfeld for advice on being a better comic. Seinfeld shared some tips that would help Isaac for a long time.

Seinfeld told Isaac that to be a better comic, he needed to write better jokes. The way to write better jokes was to write every day. He explained a method he used to keep himself disciplined. He keeps a calendar on his wall and marks off each day he writes jokes with a big red X. 

Seinfeld said, “After a few days, you’ll have a chain. Just keep going, and the chain will get longer. You’ll feel good seeing that chain, especially after a few weeks. Your only job is to not break the chain.” This method became popular among writers and fitness fans because it helps them stay consistent.

The chain method is a great example of a bigger idea called the rhythmic philosophy. This idea suggests that the best way to do deep work regularly is to make it a simple habit. The goal is to create a routine so you don’t have to think about when to do the work. The chain method combines a daily schedule with a visual reminder, like the red Xs on the calendar.

Another way to use the rhythmic philosophy is to set a specific time each day for deep work. Just like seeing your progress can help motivate you, having a set time can make it easier to start working. For example, Brian Chappell, a busy doctoral student, used this method because he had to balance writing his dissertation with a full-time job and a new baby.
