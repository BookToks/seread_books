A lot of young adults today are just figuring things out as they go. We often look at new tech and social media as signs that we’re moving forward into a cool new world.

This focus on the Internet is what we see in today’s tech-driven society. It’s important to understand this because it helps explain why some things happen. For example, The New York Times has a social media team and pushes its writers, like Alissa Rubin, to act in ways that grab attention online. In a world obsessed with the Internet, not doing this is seen as pointless.

This idea explains the big reaction when Jonathan Franzen suggested that writers shouldn’t use Twitter. People got upset not because they knew a lot about book marketing and disagreed with him, but because it shocked them that someone would say social media isn’t that important. In a tech-focused culture, saying something like that is like burning a flag—it's seen as a huge insult, not a topic for discussion.

I had a moment that showed how widespread this thinking is while I was on my way to work at Georgetown. I was waiting to cross the street behind a truck from a company that handles refrigerated shipping. This business is complicated and old-school, very different from the trendy tech startups we hear about today. But what caught my attention was a sign on the back of the truck that said, “like us on Facebook.” 

Deep work, which focuses on quality and skill, struggles in a tech-driven world because it goes against the fast-paced, distracting nature of social media. Supporting deep work often means stepping away from new tech, but it’s not that deep work is worse. If we had clear evidence showing how these different approaches affect success, our tech-focused culture might change. But without that evidence, we keep putting the Internet on a pedestal, creating a culture that values it above all else.
