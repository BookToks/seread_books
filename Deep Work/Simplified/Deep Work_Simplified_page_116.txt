assesses what matters in his work life. This is important because his reputation means he will get a lot of attention from big media outlets if his book is really good. So, he should focus more on writing the best book possible instead of trying to get a few extra sales through less effective ways. In other words, the real question isn’t whether Twitter could help Lewis; it’s whether using Twitter really helps him with the most important things in his job.

What about a writer who isn’t as famous? For them, marketing their book might be more important. But if they had to pick the two or three most important things to help with this, it’s unlikely that sending quick messages on Twitter would be one of them. This is just basic math. Imagine our writer sends ten personal tweets every day, five days a week, each connecting with a new potential reader. If 50 percent of those people become loyal fans who will buy the author’s next book, that would mean two thousand sales over two years. That’s not a huge boost when bestsellers usually need two or three times that many sales each week. So again, the question isn’t whether Twitter has some benefits, but whether those benefits are worth the time and attention it takes away from writing, which is super important for a writer.

Now that we’ve looked at this idea in a work setting, let’s think about it in a personal context, especially with something like Facebook. 

When people talk about using Facebook (or similar social networks), they often say it’s important for their social lives. So, let’s see if Facebook really helps with this by looking at a personal goal and the activities that support it. 

Personal Goal: To keep close and meaningful friendships with a group of people who matter to me.

Key Activities Supporting This Goal:
1. Regularly making time to connect meaningfully with those who are most important.
