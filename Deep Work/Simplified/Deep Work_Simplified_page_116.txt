assesses what’s important in his work life. This is because his reputation means he will get a lot of attention from major media outlets if his book is really good. So, he should focus on writing the best book possible instead of trying to get a few extra sales through less effective methods. Basically, the question isn’t whether Twitter can help him; it’s whether using Twitter actually helps him with the most important things in his job.

Now, what about a writer who isn’t as famous? For them, marketing their book might be more important. But when they think about the top two or three activities that would help them reach that goal, it’s unlikely that sending out tweets to individual readers would be one of them. Here’s why: Imagine this writer sends out ten tweets a day, five days a week, connecting with new potential readers. If half of those people become loyal fans who will buy their next book, that would mean about two thousand sales over two years. That’s not a huge increase, especially when bestsellers need two or three times that amount each week. So again, the question isn’t whether Twitter has some benefits, but whether those benefits are worth the time and effort it takes.

Now that we’ve looked at how this works in a professional setting, let’s think about personal goals, especially with something like Facebook. When people talk about using Facebook, they usually say it’s important for their social lives. So, let’s see if Facebook really helps with personal goals. We’ll use a personal goal and the activities that support it.

Personal Goal: To keep close and meaningful friendships with important people in my life.

Key Activities Supporting This Goal:
1. Make time to connect meaningfully with those who matter most.
