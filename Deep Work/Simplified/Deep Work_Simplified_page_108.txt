Before you start any serious work, it's easy to let your life get filled with distractions from apps and websites. Your willpower can only handle so much, so when there are so many fun things trying to grab your attention, it gets tough to focus on what really matters. To get good at doing deep work, you need to take back control of your time and focus from all the distractions out there.

There’s a middle ground, and if you want to build a habit of deep work, you need to fight to find it.

Our first step to finding this middle ground in choosing online tools is to...
