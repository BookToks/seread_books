I believe that people don’t fully understand the idea of serendipitous creativity. To explain this, let’s look at where this idea comes from.

This theory has many influences, but I have a personal link to one of the most famous ones. During my seven years at MIT, I worked in a place called Building 20. This building was located at the corner of Main and Vassar Streets in East Cambridge and was torn down in 1998. It was originally built as a temporary shelter during World War II to hold extra people from the busy Radiation Laboratory at MIT. A 2012 article in the New Yorker said that the building was first seen as a failure because it had poor ventilation, dark hallways, thin walls, a leaky roof, and extreme temperatures.

After the war, many scientists kept coming to Cambridge. MIT needed more space, so instead of tearing down Building 20 right away, they used it for extra room. This led to a mix of different departments, like nuclear science, linguistics, and electronics, sharing the building with unusual tenants like a machine shop and a piano repair shop. Because the building was cheap, these groups could change the space however they wanted. They could move walls and floors and attach equipment to the beams. For example, Jerrold Zacharias was able to remove two floors from his lab in Building 20 to fit a three-story cylinder for his atomic clock experiment.

At MIT, many people believe that this random mix of different fields in a flexible building created chances for collaboration and a spirit of innovation. This led to many breakthroughs in various areas, like Chomsky grammars, Loran navigational radars, and video games, all during the same busy postwar years. When they finally tore down Building 20 to build the new $300 million Stata Center (where I spent my time), people were sad to see it go. To honor the “plywood palace” that was replaced, the Stata Center’s design includes unfinished plywood boards and exposed concrete with construction marks still visible.

Around the same time that Building 20 was built, there was also a more organized effort to encourage serendipitous creativity happening two hundred miles away in Murray Hill, New Jersey. Here, Bell Labs director Mervin Kelly was leading the way.
