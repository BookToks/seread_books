You should think carefully about any network tool you use, just like people in other jobs have done for a long time. 

The three strategies that follow will help you stop thinking that any tool is good enough and start choosing your tools more carefully. This is important because the craftsman approach isn’t always straightforward. Figuring out what really matters in your life and how different tools affect those things isn’t easy—it takes practice and trying things out. The strategies will help you look at your network tools from different perspectives. Together, they can help you build a better relationship with your tools, giving you more control over your time and focus so you can succeed with other ideas later.

One strategy is to think about the important few things in your online habits. For example, Malcolm Gladwell doesn’t use Twitter. In a 2013 interview, he said, “Who says my fans want to hear from me on Twitter?” He even joked that some people might want to see less of him. Another famous author, Michael Lewis, also doesn’t use Twitter. He said, “I don’t tweet, I don’t Twitter, I couldn’t even tell you how to read or where to find a Twitter message.” George Packer, an award-winning writer, also avoids Twitter and just recently got a smartphone.

These writers don’t think Twitter is completely useless. They understand that other people find it helpful. Packer mentioned his lack of Twitter use in response to a positive article about Twitter by David Carr, a media critic. Carr said that Twitter helps him stay updated on news and reactions quickly, instead of spending a long time searching for information. However, Gladwell, Lewis, and Packer believe that the downsides of Twitter outweigh the benefits for them.
