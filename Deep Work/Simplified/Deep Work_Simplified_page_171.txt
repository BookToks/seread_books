The article talks about Radhika Nagpal's work in science, which is featured on the cover of a magazine called Science. You can check it out online.

It mentions that we're losing our ability to explain things clearly. This idea comes from a book by John Freeman called "The Tyranny of E-mail." 

There's a link to see how someone named Cal Newport manages his emails. He talks about how he reached out to Cal for advice. 

The article also discusses how too many people trying to contact you can be overwhelming. It includes tips from Clay Herbert and Antonio Centeno about managing communication. 

There's a Forbes article that talks about the "sender filter" habit, which I suggested to the author, Michael Simmons, who is a friend of mine. 

You can also see how Antonio uses his filters on his website. Tim Ferriss has a blog post about letting small problems happen instead of stressing over them.

In the conclusion, there's a mention of how focus is a key trait that made Bill Gates successful. This information comes from an article by Walter Isaacson and his book "The Innovators." 

I also looked at Stephen Manes's biography of Gates for more details. 

You can find a list of my computer science work on my academic website, where I organize my publications by year. Most computer scientists like me publish in conferences instead of journals and list authors in alphabetical order.

Finally, I want to live a focused life, as mentioned in a book by Gallagher called "Rapt."
