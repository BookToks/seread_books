Radhika Nagpal's work is featured on the cover of a science magazine. You can check it out online. 

There’s a problem where we’re losing our ability to explain things clearly. This idea comes from a book by John Freeman called "The Tyranny of E-mail." 

If you want to see how I manage my emails, you can look at my sender filters on my website. I once emailed Cal to ask him a question about it. 

At some point, too many people started reaching out to me, which made it hard to keep up. There’s an article by Michael Simmons in Forbes that talks about how to build relationships in just 15 minutes a day. 

This article also mentions my sender filter habit. I actually suggested the term "sender filter" to Michael, who is a good friend of mine. 

You can also see how Antonio uses his filters on his website. Tim Ferriss wrote about letting small problems happen instead of stressing over everything. 

In conclusion, focus is a key trait that sets successful people apart. Walter Isaacson wrote about this in an article and in his book about innovators. Most of the Bill Gates story comes from his work, along with some details from another biography by Stephen Manes. 

If you want to see my computer science work, you can find a list of my publications on my academic website. I mostly publish in competitive conferences and list authors alphabetically. 

I want to live a focused life, as mentioned in a book by Gallagher.
