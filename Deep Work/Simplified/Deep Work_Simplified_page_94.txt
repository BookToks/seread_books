People who always multitask have a hard time ignoring things that don’t matter. They can’t keep track of what they need to remember. They get distracted all the time. They use parts of their brain that aren’t needed for what they’re doing, which makes them feel mentally messed up.

Flatow asks Nass if people who are always distracted realize that their brains are changing. The people they talked to said, “When I really need to focus, I turn everything off and concentrate hard.” But sadly, they’ve built habits that make it really hard for them to focus like that. They get easily distracted and can’t stay on task.

Once your brain gets used to being distracted all the time, it’s tough to break that habit, even if you want to focus. For example, if you always check your phone whenever you feel bored, like waiting in line or sitting alone at a restaurant, your brain might have changed so much that it struggles to do deep work, even if you set aside time to practice focusing.

Rule #1 showed you how to fit deep work into your schedule and create routines that help you focus better. Rule #2 will help you improve your ability to concentrate even more. The strategies that follow are based on the idea that to really benefit from deep work, you need to train yourself. This training should focus on two things: getting better at concentrating hard and fighting the urge to get distracted. These strategies include different methods, like cutting out distractions and learning a special type of meditation, to help you go from being distracted all the time to being able to focus really well.

Don’t take breaks from focusing; instead, take breaks from distractions. Many people think they can easily switch between being distracted and being focused, but that’s not really true. Once you’re used to distractions, you start to want them. This strategy is meant to help you change your brain so it’s better at staying focused.
