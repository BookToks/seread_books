People who always multitask struggle to ignore things that don’t matter. They can’t keep information in their minds well. They get easily distracted and use a lot of their brain for things that aren’t important to what they’re doing. Basically, they’re a mess mentally.

Flatow asks Nass if people who are always distracted realize how their brains have changed. The people they talked to often said, “When I really need to focus, I turn everything off and concentrate hard.” But sadly, they’ve formed habits that make it really hard for them to focus. They get easily sidetracked and can’t stay on task.

Once your brain gets used to constant distractions, Nass found out, it’s tough to break that habit even if you want to focus. For example, if you always check your phone whenever you’re bored, like waiting in line or sitting alone at a restaurant, your brain might be so rewired that it can’t handle deep work, even if you try to practice focusing.

Rule #1 showed you how to fit deep work into your schedule and create routines that help you focus better. Rule #2 will help you improve your ability to concentrate even more. The strategies that follow are based on the idea that to really benefit from deep work, you need to train your brain. This training should focus on two things: getting better at concentrating hard and fighting the urge to get distracted. These strategies include different methods, like cutting out distractions and learning a special type of meditation, to help you go from being distracted all the time to being able to focus like a laser.

Don’t take breaks from focusing; instead, take breaks from distractions. Many people think they can easily switch between being distracted and concentrating, but that’s not true. Once you’re used to distractions, you start to want them. This strategy aims to help you change your brain so it can stay focused better.
