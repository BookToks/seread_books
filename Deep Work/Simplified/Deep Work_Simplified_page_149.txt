Hey professor. I’d like to come by sometime to chat about <topic X>. Are you free?

This message is too vague and makes it hard for the professor to answer quickly. Plus, it doesn’t explain why the meeting would be worth their time. Here’s a better way to write it that’s more likely to get a response: 

Hi professor. I’m working on a project similar to <topic X> with my advisor, <professor Y>. Can I stop by during the last fifteen minutes of your office hours on Thursday to share what we’re doing and see if it fits with your current project?

This version clearly shows why the meeting is a good idea and makes it easier for the professor to respond.

This tip suggests you should try to be like professors when it comes to emails. To help you, here are three rules to decide which emails you should reply to and which you can ignore:

**Professorial Email Sorting:**
1. Don’t reply if the email is confusing or hard to answer.
2. Don’t reply if it’s not something you care about.
3. Don’t reply if nothing good or bad will happen from your response.

Of course, there are exceptions. For example, if the CEO of your company sends a confusing email, you should reply. But in general, this approach encourages you to be stricter about when you hit “reply.”

This might feel weird at first because people usually expect you to respond to all emails, no matter how relevant they are. Some people might get confused or upset if you don’t reply, especially if they’re used to the usual email rules.
