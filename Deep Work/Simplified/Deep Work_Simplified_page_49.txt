This email was part of a chat where I was trying to set up a time to meet with a friend who was visiting my city. It was tricky because he had a busy schedule.

This message was about a conversation between a coworker and me discussing some annoying office politics that often happen in academic jobs. These emails show how we often get distracted by small issues at work. Some topics are easy, like talking about an interesting article. Others can be a bit stressful, like discussing retirement savings, which usually ends with you feeling like you're not doing enough. There are also frustrating parts, like trying to plan a meeting when everyone is busy, and negative stuff like dealing with scammers or worrying about office drama.

Many people at work spend a lot of time dealing with these minor issues. Even when they need to focus on something important, checking emails constantly keeps these small problems in their minds. Gallagher warns that this is a bad way to work because it makes you feel stressed, annoyed, and frustrated. The world of your inbox isn’t a happy place to be. 

Even if your coworkers are nice and your chats are positive, if you let yourself get distracted by these small issues, you might fall into a trap. Gallagher says, “Five years of reporting on attention have confirmed some home truths.” One of these truths is that when you lose focus, your mind tends to think about what’s wrong in your life instead of what’s good. A workday filled with these minor distractions can be tiring and upsetting, even if they seem harmless.

The takeaway from this is clear. In work, especially knowledge work, spending more time focused on deeper tasks can help you feel more satisfied and find more meaning in your job. Gallagher shares that after going through a tough experience, he has a plan for living his life better.
