At the beginning of my postdoc, I was really distracted. I spent a lot of time "thinking" but didn’t get much done. It took me about twelve tries before I started to see real progress. You might go through something similar, so be patient. To help speed things up, I have two tips for you.

**Tip #1: Watch Out for Distractions and Looping**  
When you start a meditation session, your mind might wander to other thoughts that seem more interesting. For me, I often found myself thinking about emails I needed to write. Even though that sounds boring, it felt really tempting at the time. If you notice your mind drifting away, remind yourself that you can think about that later and bring your focus back to what you were doing. Distractions like this are a big challenge when trying to build a good meditation habit. 

Another sneaky problem is looping. When you face a tough problem, your brain will try to save energy by sticking to what you already know instead of digging deeper. For example, when I work on a math proof, I sometimes keep going over simple results instead of tackling the harder parts. You need to watch out for this looping because it can ruin your meditation session. If you catch yourself looping, just acknowledge it and shift your focus to the next step.

**Tip #2: Organize Your Deep Thinking**  
“Thinking deeply” about a problem seems easy, but it can actually be tricky. When you have a quiet mind, a tough problem, and time to think, figuring out what to do next can be hard. From my experience, having a plan for deep thinking helps a lot. Start by reviewing the important details you need to solve the problem and keep those in your mind. For example, if you’re outlining a book chapter, think about the main points you want to include. If you’re solving a math proof, those details might be different.
