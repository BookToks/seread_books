normal routine. If he needed something that was packed, he would take it out and put it back where it belonged. By the end of the week, he saw that most of his stuff stayed in its boxes without being touched. 

So, he decided to get rid of it. Stuff builds up in our lives because when we think about throwing something away, we often worry, “What if I need this someday?” This worry makes us keep things we don’t really need. Nicodemus’s packing party showed him that most of his stuff wasn’t necessary, which helped him want to simplify his life.

The last strategy gives you a clear way to start sorting through the things that take up your time and attention. It’s a different but helpful way to deal with these issues, inspired by Ryan Nicodemus’s method of getting rid of his useless stuff.

This strategy suggests that you do something like a packing party with your social media accounts. Instead of packing, you’ll stop using them for thirty days. This means all of them: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and any others that are popular now. Don’t deactivate your accounts, and don’t tell anyone online that you’re taking a break; just stop using them completely. If someone asks why you’re not active, you can explain, but don’t make a big deal out of it.

After thirty days of not using these social media platforms, ask yourself two questions about each one you quit: 
1. Would the last thirty days have been better if I had used this service?
2. Did anyone care that I wasn’t using it?

If you answer “no” to both questions, then you should quit that service for good. If you say “yes” to both, then go back to using it. If your answers are mixed or unclear, it’s up to you whether to return, but I suggest leaning towards quitting. You can always come back later.

This strategy focuses on social media because these platforms can take up a lot of your time and attention. If you use them too much, they can really hurt your ability to focus on what matters.
