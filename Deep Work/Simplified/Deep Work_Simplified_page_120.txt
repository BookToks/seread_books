normal routine. If he needed something that was packed, he would take it out and put it back where it belonged. At the end of the week, he saw that most of his stuff stayed in its boxes without being touched.

So, he decided to get rid of it. 

People tend to collect a lot of stuff because when they think about throwing something away, they worry, “What if I need this later?” This worry makes them keep things they don’t really need. Nicodemus’s packing party showed him that most of his stuff wasn’t necessary, which helped him want to simplify his life.

The last strategy gives you a way to start sorting through the things that take up your time and attention. This method is inspired by Ryan Nicodemus’s way of getting rid of his useless stuff.

Basically, this strategy suggests you do something like a packing party for your social media. Instead of packing, you’ll stop using all your social media for thirty days. This includes Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and any other popular apps. Don’t deactivate your accounts, and don’t tell anyone online that you’re taking a break—just stop using them completely. If someone asks why you’re not active, you can explain, but don’t make a big deal out of it.

After thirty days of not using these apps, think about two questions for each service you quit:
1. Would the last thirty days have been better if I could use this service?
2. Did anyone care that I wasn’t using this service?

If you answer “no” to both questions, then you should quit that service for good. If you say “yes,” then you can go back to using it. If your answers are unclear, it’s up to you, but I suggest leaning towards quitting. You can always come back later.

This strategy focuses on social media because these platforms can really take away your time and attention. If you use them too much, they can hurt your ability to focus on deeper work.
