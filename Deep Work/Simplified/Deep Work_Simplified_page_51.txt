Most people think relaxing is better than working, but research by Csikszentmihalyi shows that's not true. 

Actually, jobs can be more enjoyable than free time because they have clear goals, feedback, and challenges that help you focus and get lost in what you're doing. Free time is often unstructured, which makes it harder to enjoy. Studies found that people are happier at work than they think, and the more they experience flow—being fully engaged in an activity—the happier they feel overall. 

It seems people are at their best when they dive deep into something challenging. There’s a connection between Csikszentmihalyi’s flow theory and Winifred Gallagher’s ideas. Both agree that focusing deeply is important, but they explain it differently. Gallagher believes that what we focus on matters. If we pay attention to important things and ignore the negative ones, we’ll find our work more meaningful and positive. 

On the other hand, Csikszentmihalyi’s flow theory doesn’t care much about the content we focus on. He thinks that just the feeling of being deeply engaged is rewarding, no matter what we’re doing. Deep work is great for getting into a flow state, which is when you’re really focused and enjoying the challenge. 

Research shows that deep work can make life feel more worthwhile. Csikszentmihalyi even suggests that companies should change jobs to make them more like flow activities. However, he admits that this would be tough to do. So, he emphasizes that it’s crucial for individuals to find ways to create their own flow experiences. This is the key takeaway.
