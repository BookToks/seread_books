A hammock sounds relaxing, but research by Csikszentmihalyi shows that most people get it wrong. 

Surprisingly, jobs can be more enjoyable than free time. This is because jobs have clear goals, feedback, and challenges that help you focus and get really into your work. Free time, on the other hand, is often unstructured and takes more effort to turn into something fun. Studies found that people are actually happier at work than when they’re just relaxing. The more times you experience this “flow” during the week, the more satisfied you feel with life. It seems that people are happiest when they are deeply engaged in something challenging.

There’s a connection between Csikszentmihalyi’s flow theory and Winifred Gallagher’s ideas. Both say that focusing deeply is important, but they explain it in different ways. Gallagher believes that what we focus on matters. If we pay attention to important things and ignore the negative stuff, we’ll find our work more meaningful and positive. 

Csikszentmihalyi, on the other hand, doesn’t focus much on what we pay attention to. He thinks that just the feeling of being deeply involved in something is rewarding. Our brains enjoy the challenge, no matter what the topic is.

Deep work and flow go hand in hand. Deep work helps create a flow state, which is when you’re really focused and lose track of time. And as we learned, being in a flow state makes you happy. This shows that depth in what we do is super important. Research from Csikszentmihalyi’s studies backs this up, showing that going deep in our activities makes life feel more worthwhile.

Csikszentmihalyi even suggests that companies should change jobs to make them more like flow activities. But he also points out that this would be hard to do. So, it’s even more important for individuals to learn how to find flow in their own lives. That’s the key takeaway.
