Rule #4  
Drain the Shallows  

In the summer of 2007, a software company called 37signals (now Basecamp) tried something new: they cut their workweek from five days to four. Their workers were still getting the same amount of work done in one less day, so they decided to keep it that way. From May to October, the employees now only work Monday to Thursday, except for customer support, which still works all week. Company co-founder Jason Fried joked in a blog post, “People should enjoy the weather in the summer.”  

But not everyone was happy about this change. A few months later, journalist Tara Weiss wrote an article for Forbes called “Why a Four-Day Work Week Doesn’t Work.” She said that trying to fit 40 hours of work into four days isn’t a smart way to do things. Many people struggle with eight-hour days, and making them work two extra hours could lower their mood and productivity.  

Fried quickly replied in a blog post called “Forbes Misses the Point of the 4-Day Work Week.” He agreed that cramming 40 hours into four days would be stressful for workers. But he explained that’s not what he meant. “The point of the 4-day work week is about doing less work,” he wrote. “It’s not about four 10-hour days… it’s about four normal 8-hour days.”  

This might sound confusing. At first, Fried said his employees get just as much done in four days as they do in five. Now, he’s saying they actually work fewer hours. How can both be true? The key is understanding what shallow work means. Fried explains that very few people actually work a full eight hours a day. Most people are lucky if they get a few good hours of work done between meetings, distractions, web surfing, office drama, and personal stuff that happens during a typical workday.
