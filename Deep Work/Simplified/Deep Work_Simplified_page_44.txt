Chapter Three  
Deep Work Is Meaningful  

Ric Furrer is a blacksmith. He focuses on old-school metalworking techniques from ancient and medieval times, which he carefully recreates in his shop called Door County Forgeworks. “I do all my work by hand and use tools that help me work better without holding back my creativity or connection with the metal,” he says in his artist’s statement. “What might take me 100 hits by hand can be done in one hit with a big machine. This goes against what I want to achieve, and you can see the marks of my two hands in all my work.”  

A 2012 PBS documentary gives us a look into Furrer’s life. He works in a barn that has been turned into a workshop in the Wisconsin countryside, not far from the beautiful Sturgeon Bay on Lake Michigan. Furrer often leaves the barn doors open to let out the heat from the forges, and you can see farm fields stretching out in front of him. The place looks nice, but the work can seem tough at first. In the documentary, Furrer is trying to make a sword from the Viking era. He starts by using a 1,500-year-old method to create crucible steel, which is a very pure form of metal for that time. The result is a piece of metal, not much bigger than three or four stacked smartphones. This heavy piece needs to be shaped and polished into a long, beautiful sword blade.  

“This part, the initial breakdown, is terrible,” Furrer says to the camera as he carefully heats the metal, hits it with a hammer, turns it, hits it again, and puts it back in the fire to start over. The narrator mentions that it will take eight hours of hammering to finish shaping it. But as you watch Furrer work, you start to see things differently. He’s not just mindlessly hitting the metal like a miner with a pickaxe. Each hit is strong but very controlled. He looks closely at the metal through his thin glasses (which seem a bit odd above his thick beard and broad shoulders), turning it just right for each strike. “You have to be very gentle with it or you will crack it,” he explains. After a few more hits, he adds, “You have to nudge it; slowly it breaks down; then you start to enjoy it.”
