decisions about where different work tasks fit on a scale from easy to hard. To figure this out, you can ask a simple question: 

How long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no special training in my field to do this task?

Let’s look at some examples to understand this better.

**Example #1:** Editing an academic paper is tough. You need to know a lot about the topic to make sure everything is accurate and also understand the wider research to cite it correctly. This kind of knowledge usually takes years of study, especially at the graduate level. So, for this task, it might take around fifty to seventy-five months of training.

**Example #2:** Making a PowerPoint presentation about your quarterly sales is easier. You need to know how to use PowerPoint, understand the usual format for these presentations, and know what sales data your company tracks. A smart college graduate probably already knows how to use PowerPoint, and learning the format should only take about a week. The main challenge is figuring out the sales metrics and how to turn them into graphs. This isn’t super easy, but it shouldn’t take more than a month of training. So, we can say it would take about two months total.

**Example #3:** Meetings can be hard to judge. They might seem boring, but they are often important for your organization. To see how long it would take to train a recent college graduate to take your place in a planning meeting, they would need to understand the project well enough to know its goals and the skills of the team involved.
