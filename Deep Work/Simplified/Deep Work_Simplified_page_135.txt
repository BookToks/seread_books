decisions about where different work tasks fit on a scale from easy to hard. To figure this out, you should ask yourself a simple question: 

How long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no special training in my field to do this task?

Let’s look at this question with some examples of unclear tasks.

Analyzing Example #1: Editing an academic paper properly means you need to understand the details of the work and the wider research in that field. This takes a lot of knowledge that usually requires years of study after college. So, for this task, the answer to our question would be pretty high, maybe around fifty to seventy-five months.

Analyzing Example #2: The second example isn’t as complicated. To create a PowerPoint presentation about your quarterly sales, you need three things: first, knowing how to use PowerPoint; second, understanding the usual format for these presentations in your company; and third, knowing what sales numbers your company tracks and how to turn them into graphs. We can assume that a smart college graduate already knows how to use PowerPoint, and learning the format shouldn’t take more than a week. The real question is how long it takes to learn the sales numbers and how to present them. This isn’t super easy, but for a smart grad, it wouldn’t take more than an extra month of training—so we can say about two months in total.

Analyzing Example #3: Meetings can be hard to figure out. They can feel boring, but they’re often really important for what your organization does. This method helps clear things up. How long would it take to train a smart recent college graduate to take your place in a planning meeting? They would need to understand the project well enough to know its goals and the skills of the people involved. Our hypothetical grad...
