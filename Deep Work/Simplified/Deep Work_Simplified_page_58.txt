You need information for your project. Dewane compares the library to “the hard drive of the machine.” 

Next is the office space. It has a regular conference room with a whiteboard and some cubicles with desks. Dewane says, “the office is for low-intensity activity.” This means it’s the place to do the easier tasks for your project. Dewane thinks there should be someone in the office to help people improve their work habits and be more efficient. 

Now, let’s talk about the last room, which Dewane calls “deep work chambers.” Each chamber is six by ten feet and has thick soundproof walls. Dewane explains that the deep work chamber is meant for total focus and uninterrupted work. He imagines you spend ninety minutes inside, then take a ninety-minute break, and repeat this two or three times. After that, your brain will be at its limit for the day. 

Right now, the Eudaimonia Machine is just a set of drawings, but Dewane is excited about its potential to help people do great work. He told me, “[This design] is the most interesting piece of architecture I’ve ever produced.” 

In a perfect world, we would all have something like the Eudaimonia Machine. It might not be Dewane’s exact design, but it would be a work environment that helps us get the most out of our brains. Sadly, that’s not how things are now. Instead, we have distracting open offices where we can’t ignore our emails and have endless meetings. In this setting, coworkers want quick replies to their emails instead of the best results. So, as a reader of this book, you’re trying to find depth in a shallow world. 

This rule is the first of four rules in Part 2 of this book, and it aims to help with this problem. You might not have your own Eudaimonia Machine, but the strategies that follow will help you create similar effects in your distracting work life. They will show you how to make deep work a regular part of your daily schedule. The next rules will help you get the most out of this deep work habit by giving tips on improving your focus and dealing with distractions.
