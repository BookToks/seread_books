You have a good reason to use a network tool if you can see any possible benefit from it or if you think you might miss out on something important by not using it. 

But the problem with this way of thinking is that it ignores the downsides of these tools. Many of these services are designed to be addictive, taking away your time and focus from things that actually help you reach your personal and professional goals, like doing deep work. If you use these tools too much, you might end up feeling burned out and super distracted, just like Baratunde Thurston and many others. This shows how dangerous it can be to think that any small benefit is enough to justify using a tool without considering the negatives. If you don’t balance the good and bad, you might hurt your chances of succeeding in your work.

This idea shouldn’t be surprising. We’ve gotten used to thinking this way about network tools, but if we look at it from a bigger perspective, it seems strange. When we stop seeing the Internet as a big deal, we realize that network tools are just like any other tools, like a hammer or a paintbrush. Skilled workers have always been careful and thoughtful about the tools they choose to use. There’s no reason why people working with digital tools can’t do the same. Just because these tools are online doesn’t change that.

To understand how to choose tools more carefully, it helps to talk to someone who works with physical tools and depends on them to succeed. I found a great example in Forrest Pritchard, a tall English major who became a successful sustainable farmer. He runs Smith Meadows, a family farm located about an hour from Washington, D.C., in the Blue Ridge Mountains. After taking over the farm from his parents, Pritchard made some changes to improve the operation.
