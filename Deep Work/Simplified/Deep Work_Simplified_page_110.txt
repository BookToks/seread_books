You should use a network tool if you can see any possible benefit from it or if there's something you might miss out on by not using it. 

But the problem with this way of thinking is that it ignores the downsides of these tools. Many of these services are designed to be addictive, taking away your time and focus from things that really help you achieve your personal and professional goals, like doing deep work. If you use these tools too much, you might end up feeling burned out and super distracted, just like Baratunde Thurston and many others. This shows how dangerous it can be to think only about the benefits. If you only look for any small advantage to justify using a tool without considering the negatives, you might actually hurt your chances of doing well in your work.

This idea shouldn’t be surprising. We’ve gotten used to thinking this way about network tools, but if we step back and look at it in the bigger picture of skilled work, it seems strange. When you forget the hype around the Internet and the idea that you have to be all in or you're just a grumpy old person, you realize that network tools are just like any other tools, like a blacksmith's hammer or an artist's brush. Skilled workers have always been careful and thoughtful about the tools they choose to use. There’s no reason why people who work with knowledge online can’t do the same. Just because these tools are digital doesn’t change that.

To understand how to choose tools more carefully, it helps to talk to someone who works with physical tools and depends on them to succeed. Luckily, I found someone like that—Forrest Pritchard, a tall English major who became a successful sustainable farmer. 

Forrest runs Smith Meadows, a family farm about an hour from D.C., in the Blue Ridge Mountains. After taking over the farm from his parents, he made some changes to the operation.
