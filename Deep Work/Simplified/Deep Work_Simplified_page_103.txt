Once you know the important variables or ideas, you need to figure out the specific question you want to answer with those variables. For example, if you’re writing a book chapter, your question might be, “How do I start this chapter well?” If you’re working on a proof, it could be, “What could go wrong if I don’t assume this rule is true?” 

Once you have your variables and your question, you can focus on that specific target. If you can answer your question, the last step is to review your answer clearly. This helps you go deeper into your thinking. You can then repeat the process. This cycle of reviewing, identifying your next question, and consolidating your answers is like a workout for your brain. It will help you get more from your meditation sessions and speed up how quickly you improve your deep thinking skills.

Daniel Kilov can memorize a shuffled deck of cards, a hundred random digits, or 115 abstract shapes in just five minutes. He even set a national record in Australia for memorizing shapes! It’s not surprising that he won silver medals in the Australian memory championships. What’s surprising is that he didn’t always have an amazing memory.

Kilov said, “I wasn’t born with a great memory.” In high school, he thought he was forgetful and messy. He struggled in school and was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder. Everything changed when he met Tansel Ali, a famous memory champion. Kilov started training his memory seriously. By the time he finished college, he had already won his first national medal.

Kilov’s quick rise to becoming a memory champion is impressive, but it’s not the only story like this. In 2006, Joshua Foer became the USA Memory Champion after just a year of hard training, which he wrote about in his book, *Moonwalking with Einstein*. What’s really important about Kilov’s story is how his memory training improved his school performance. While he was training his brain, he went from being a struggling student with attention deficit disorder to graduating from a tough Australian university.
