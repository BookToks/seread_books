Don’t be surprised if deep work is hard to focus on when there are so many distractions like tweets, likes, and posts. We’re taught that these things are important just because they exist.

Deep work should be a top priority in today’s business world, but it often isn’t. I’ve shared some reasons for this. One reason is that deep work is tough, while shallow work is easy. When people don’t have clear goals, they tend to stick to the busy work that looks productive. Plus, our culture thinks that anything related to the Internet is good, no matter how it affects our ability to create valuable things. These trends are made worse because it’s hard to measure how valuable deep work is or what we lose by ignoring it.

If you believe deep work is important, this situation is bad news for businesses because they might miss out on big chances to improve. But for you, there’s some good news. Since many people around you are focused on shallow work, deep work will become rarer and more valuable. Now that we know deep work is good and distractions aren’t necessary, you can confidently work on developing your ability to focus deeply. By doing this, you’ll gain great rewards.
