It’s no surprise that focusing deeply on work is tough when we’re surrounded by the constant buzz of tweets, likes, tagged photos, and posts. These distractions seem important just because they exist.

Deep work should be a big deal in today’s business world, but it isn’t. I’ve explained why this is the case. For one, deep work is hard, while shallow work is easy. When people don’t have clear goals at their jobs, they tend to get busy with shallow work just to look productive. Plus, our culture thinks that anything related to the Internet is good, no matter how it affects our ability to create valuable things. It’s hard to measure how valuable deep work is or what we lose by ignoring it.

If you believe deep work is important, this is bad news for businesses because they’re missing out on big chances to be more productive. But for you, there’s good news. While your peers and bosses focus on distractions, you can gain an advantage. If these trends keep going, deep work will be rare and more valuable.

Now that we know deep work isn’t flawed and distractions aren’t necessary, you can confidently work on your ability to focus deeply. By doing this, you can achieve great rewards.
