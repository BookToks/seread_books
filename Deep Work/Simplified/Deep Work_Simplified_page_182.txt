The Internet sabbatical is different from the Internet Sabbath in Rule #2. 

The Internet Sabbath suggests you take short breaks from the Internet, usually just one day a week. 

On the other hand, an Internet sabbatical means taking a long break from being online, which can last for several weeks or even longer. 

**PAGE SUMMARY:** The Internet sabbatical is a long break from the Internet, while the Internet Sabbath is a shorter, regular break. The two concepts are not the same, with the Sabbath being just one day a week.
