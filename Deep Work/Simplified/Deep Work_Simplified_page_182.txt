Notice, the Internet sabbatical is not the same as the Internet Sabbath mentioned in Rule #2. 

The Internet Sabbath suggests that you take short breaks from the Internet, usually just one day on the weekend. 

On the other hand, an Internet sabbatical means taking a much longer break from being online, which can last for several weeks or even longer.
