The Internet sabbatical is different from the Internet Sabbath in Rule #2. The Internet Sabbath means you should take short breaks from the Internet, usually just one day a week. 

On the other hand, an Internet sabbatical is a much longer break from being online. It can last for several weeks or even longer.
