impact activities, which means you’re wasting time that could be used for more important things. It’s like a game where you can’t win if you keep choosing the less valuable options. When you spend your time on high-impact activities, you get way better results than if you focus on low-impact ones. So, if you keep choosing the low-impact stuff, you end up getting less overall.

Businesses get this idea. That’s why they sometimes let go of clients that don’t bring in much money. If 80% of their profits come from just 20% of their clients, they can make more money by focusing on the few clients that pay well instead of wasting time on the ones that don’t. The same goes for your own goals, whether they’re about work or personal life. If you spend less time on low-impact activities—like scrolling through Facebook to find old friends—and more time on high-impact ones—like having lunch with a good friend—you’ll do better in reaching your goals. So, giving up a tool that doesn’t help much isn’t about missing out on small benefits, but about making the most of what really helps you succeed.

Going back to the beginning, for writers like Malcolm Gladwell, Michael Lewis, and George Packer, Twitter doesn’t help with the 20% of activities that lead to most of their success. Even though Twitter might offer some small benefits, when you look at their careers overall, they probably do better without it. They can use that time for more valuable things instead of adding Twitter to their busy schedules. You should think carefully about which tools you let take up your time and attention.

His plan was simple but pretty bold. He spent an afternoon packing everything he owned into cardboard boxes like he was moving. To make this tough task easier, he called it a “packing party,” saying, “Everything’s more fun when it’s a party, right?”

After he finished packing, Ryan spent the next week going through his
