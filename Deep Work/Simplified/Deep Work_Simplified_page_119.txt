impact activities. When you spend time on less important things, you miss out on doing things that really matter. It’s like a game where you can only win if you focus on the right stuff. If you waste time on low-impact activities, you get less overall benefit.

Businesses get this idea. That’s why they sometimes fire clients who don’t make them much money. If 80% of their profits come from just 20% of their clients, they can make more money by focusing on the good clients instead. The same goes for your own goals. If you stop wasting time on things like scrolling through Facebook and instead spend that time with a good friend, you’ll do better in reaching your goals. So, giving up a tool that doesn’t help much isn’t about losing out; it’s about making room for things that really help you succeed.

Going back to the writers Malcolm Gladwell, Michael Lewis, and George Packer, they found that Twitter doesn’t help them with the important parts of their careers. Even if Twitter has some small benefits, they probably do better without it, using that time for things that really matter. You should think carefully about which tools you let take up your time and attention.

To make it less boring, he called it a “packing party,” saying, “Everything’s more fun when it’s a party, right?”

After packing, Ryan spent the next week going through his things.
