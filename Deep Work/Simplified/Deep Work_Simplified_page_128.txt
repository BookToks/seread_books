Having fewer official working hours helps people focus better during the workweek. When everyone has less time to get things done, they start to value that time more. They become careful with their time, which is a good thing. They don’t waste it on stuff that doesn’t really matter. With fewer hours, people usually spend their time more wisely.

Basically, cutting down the workweek at 37signals got rid of a lot of the less important tasks while still allowing the important work to happen. The stuff that seems urgent but isn’t really that important turned out to be easy to let go of.

You might wonder what would happen if 37signals took this idea even further. If getting rid of less important work didn’t change the results much, what if they replaced that time with more important work? Luckily, the company decided to try this out too.

Fried was always curious about tech companies like Google that let their employees spend 20% of their time on personal projects. He liked this idea but thought that just one day a week wasn’t enough for deep work that leads to real breakthroughs. He said, “I’d rather have 5 days in a row than spread out over 5 weeks.” His theory was that longer, uninterrupted time would lead to better results.

To test this, 37signals did something bold: they gave their employees the whole month of June off to work on their own projects without any shallow work distractions—no meetings, no emails, and no PowerPoint presentations. At the end of the month, they held a “pitch day” where employees shared the ideas they had been working on.

In an article for Inc. magazine, Fried called this experiment a success. The pitch day led to two new projects that were quickly developed: a better customer support tool and a data visualization system to help the company understand how customers use their products. These projects are expected to add a lot of value to the company, but they probably wouldn’t have happened without the focused time given to employees. It took many hours of dedicated work to bring these ideas to life.

Fried asked, “How can we afford to pause our business for a month to explore new ideas?” He answered, “How can we afford not to?”
