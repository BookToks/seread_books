This website says, “What I do takes long hours of studying and focus.” Brian Chappell, a doctoral student who also has a full-time job and kids, really values deep work because it’s the only way he can make progress on his dissertation with his busy schedule. He told me that when he first learned about deep work, it was a big moment for him.

I share these examples because even though Knuth and Chappell both think deep work is important, they have different ideas about how to fit it into their work lives. In the next section, I’ll explain that Knuth tries to focus on deep work by cutting out or reducing all other types of work. On the other hand, Chappell has a routine where he works every weekday morning from five to seven-thirty without fail, before starting a day filled with regular distractions. Both methods work, but they don’t work for everyone. Knuth’s way might be good for someone whose main job is to think deeply, but if Chappell tried to avoid all distractions like Knuth, he might end up losing his job.

You need to find your own way to include deep work in your professional life. (As mentioned earlier, trying to fit in deep work randomly isn’t a good way to manage your limited willpower.) This example shows that you need to pick a method that fits your situation, or it could mess up your deep work habit before it even starts. I’ll share four different ways to schedule deep work that I’ve seen work really well. The goal is to show you that there are many ways to fit deep work into your schedule, so it’s worth taking time to find what works best for you.

Now, let’s talk about Donald Knuth again. He’s well-known for many important ideas in computer science, especially for creating a detailed way to analyze how algorithms work. But among his peers, he’s also known for his unusual approach to email. If you visit Knuth’s website at Stanford looking for his email address, you’ll find this note instead: “I have been a happy man ever since January 1, 1990, when I no longer had an email address. I’d used email since about 1975, and it seems to me that 15...
