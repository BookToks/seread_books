This website says, “What I do takes long hours of studying and focus.” Brian Chappell, a doctoral student who also has a full-time job and kids, really values deep work because it’s the only way he can make progress on his dissertation with his busy schedule. He shared that learning about deep work was a big moment for him.

I mention these examples because both Knuth and Chappell agree that deep work is important, but they have different ways of making it part of their work lives. Knuth tries to cut out all distractions to focus deeply, while Chappell works every morning from five to seven-thirty without fail, even though his day gets filled with regular distractions later. Both methods work, but they don’t work for everyone. Knuth’s way is great for someone whose job is mainly about big ideas, but if Chappell tried to ignore all distractions, he might end up losing his job.

You need to find your own way to fit deep work into your life. Trying to schedule deep work randomly doesn’t really help you manage your energy. This example shows that you need to pick a method that works for your situation because if it doesn’t match, it could ruin your deep work habit before it even starts. I’ll share four different strategies that have worked really well for others. The goal is to show you that there are many ways to include deep work in your schedule, so it’s worth taking the time to find what fits you best.

Let’s go back to Donald Knuth. He’s well-known for many important ideas in computer science, especially for figuring out how to analyze how algorithms work. But he’s also known for his unusual approach to email. If you check out his website at Stanford looking for his email address, you’ll find this note: “I’ve been happy since January 1, 1990, when I stopped using email. I used it since about 1975, and it seems to me that 15 years of email was enough.”
