Many creative thinkers stick to strict routines. If you're open to changing your plans when a new idea pops up, you're just as good at following your inspiration as someone who gets easily distracted.

To sum it up, the goal of this approach is to show that you need to respect your time to do deep work. A good first step is to decide what you’ll do with every minute of your workday ahead of time. At first, it might feel weird to plan this way because it’s easier to let random thoughts and outside requests control your schedule. But if you want to reach your full potential as a creator, you need to get used to having some structure.

Measuring how much time you spend on different activities is a big plus of planning your day. However, figuring out how much time you waste on shallow tasks can be tricky. Shallow work is defined as tasks that don’t require much thought, are often done while distracted, and don’t create much new value. 

Some tasks are clearly shallow, like checking emails or setting up a conference call. But other tasks can be harder to categorize. For example:

Example #1: Editing a draft of an article you plan to submit.
Example #2: Creating a PowerPoint presentation about sales figures.
Example #3: Attending a meeting to discuss an important project.

It’s not always easy to tell if these tasks are shallow or not. The first two can be challenging, while the last one seems crucial for moving a project forward. This strategy helps you figure out how to categorize these tasks clearly and consistently.
