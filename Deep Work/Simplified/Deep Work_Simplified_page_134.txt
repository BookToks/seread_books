about the strict routines that many great creative thinkers follow. And because you’re open to changing your plans when a new idea comes up, you’re just as ready as someone who gets distracted to jump on inspiration when it hits.

To sum it up, the reason for this approach is that you need to treat your time seriously to build a strong work habit. A good first step is to decide ahead of time what you’ll do with every minute of your workday. At first, it might feel weird to do this because it’s usually easier to let your own feelings and other people’s requests control your schedule. But you need to get past this fear of structure if you want to reach your full potential as a creator.

Measure How Deep Each Task Is  
One benefit of planning your day is that you can see how much time you’re spending on shallow tasks. However, figuring this out can be tricky because it’s not always clear how shallow a task really is. Let’s start by reminding ourselves what shallow work means:

Shallow Work:  
Tasks that don’t require much thinking, usually done while distracted. These tasks don’t create much new value and are easy to repeat.

Some tasks are clearly shallow. For example, checking emails or setting up a conference call is definitely shallow. But other tasks can be harder to classify. Think about these examples:

Example #1: Editing a draft of an academic article that you and a partner will soon send to a journal.  
Example #2: Creating a PowerPoint presentation about this quarter’s sales numbers.  
Example #3: Going to a meeting to talk about the current status of an important project and to agree on the next steps.

At first, it’s not clear how to categorize these tasks. The first two seem pretty demanding, while the last one seems important for moving a key project forward. The goal of this strategy is to give you a clear way to figure out how to classify these tasks consistently.
