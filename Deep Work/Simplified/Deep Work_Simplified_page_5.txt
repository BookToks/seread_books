Carl Jung became one of the most important thinkers of the 1900s. There are many reasons for his success, but in this book, I want to focus on one skill that really helped him: 

Deep Work: This means doing professional tasks without distractions, where you really concentrate and push your brain to its limits. This kind of work creates new value, helps you get better at what you do, and is tough for others to copy.

Deep work is essential to get the most out of your brainpower. Research in psychology and neuroscience shows that the mental effort from deep work is also necessary to improve your skills. So, deep work was exactly what Jung needed to stand out in a challenging field like psychiatry back in the early 1900s.

The term “deep work” is something I came up with, and Jung wouldn’t have used it, but his actions showed he understood the idea. He built a stone tower in the woods to help him focus on deep work in his career. This project took a lot of time, energy, and money, and it meant he had to step away from other things. Jung often traveled to his tower, which meant he spent less time with his patients. He knew that even though he had people depending on him, taking time off for deep work was important for his goal of making a difference in the world.

If you look at the lives of other famous people from history, you’ll see that focusing on deep work is a common theme. For example, the writer Michel de Montaigne worked in a private library he built at his French château, similar to how Jung worked in his tower. Mark Twain wrote a lot of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer in a shed at his summer home, so far from the main house that his family had to blow a horn to call him for meals.

Looking at more recent times, take Woody Allen, the filmmaker. Between 1969 and 2013, he wrote and directed forty-four films that got twenty-three Academy Award nominations, which is a crazy amount of work. He never used a computer and wrote everything on a manual typewriter to avoid distractions. Another example is Peter Higgs, a physicist who also works without modern technology to stay focused.
