Carl Jung became one of the most important thinkers of the twentieth century. There are many reasons for his success, but I want to focus on one skill that really helped him: 

Deep Work: This means doing professional tasks without distractions, really focusing hard, and pushing your brain to its limits. When you do deep work, you create new ideas, get better at what you do, and it’s not easy for others to copy.

Deep work is important to get the most out of your brain. Research shows that the mental effort needed for deep work is also what helps you improve your skills. For Jung, deep work was exactly what he needed to stand out in a tough field like psychiatry back then.

The term “deep work” is something I came up with, and Jung wouldn’t have used it, but his actions showed he understood the idea. He built a stone tower in the woods to help him focus on his work. This took a lot of time, energy, and money, and it meant he had to step back from other things. Jung often went to this tower, which meant he spent less time with his patients. He didn’t mind taking time off, even though many people depended on him. Deep work was really important for him to achieve his goal of making a difference in the world.

If you look at other famous people from history, you’ll see that they also valued deep work. For example, Michel de Montaigne, a writer from the sixteenth century, worked in a private library he built in his French château. Mark Twain wrote a lot of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer in a shed at his summer home in New York, so far from the main house that his family had to blow a horn to call him for meals.

Looking at more recent history, Woody Allen, a famous director and writer, created forty-four films between 1969 and 2013, and they got twenty-three Academy Award nominations. That’s an incredible amount of work! During that time, he never used a computer and wrote everything on a manual typewriter, which helped him avoid distractions. Another person who stayed away from computers is Peter Higgs, a physicist who also works without electronic distractions.
