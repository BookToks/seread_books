Every week, I plan my work and make changes if I need to at the start of each day. This helps me save my mental energy for actually doing the deep thinking I need to do.

Scheduling deep work can be tough, but if you believe in what you’re creating and practice focusing deeply, it can really help you get a lot done, even when you have a busy schedule.

Ritualize

People who create valuable things usually have specific work habits. For example, Robert Caro, a Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer, has strict rules for his office. Everything, from where he puts his books to what he wears, follows a routine he’s kept for years. He says he trained himself to be organized.

Charles Darwin also had a strict routine while working on his famous book, On the Origin of Species. His son Francis remembered that Darwin would wake up at seven, take a short walk, eat breakfast alone, and then work in his study. He would read letters from the day before and then think about tough ideas while walking a specific path on his property. He would keep walking until he felt satisfied with his thoughts, then he’d finish his workday.

Mason Currey, a journalist who studied the habits of famous thinkers and writers, pointed out that many people think artists just wait for inspiration to hit them. But he believes that waiting for inspiration is a bad idea. The best advice for anyone doing creative work is to not rely on inspiration.
