Dijksterhuis and his team did some experiments that helped them come up with a theory called unconscious thought theory (UTT). This theory tries to explain how our conscious and unconscious minds help us make decisions. 

Basically, UTT says that when you have to follow strict rules, like doing math, you need to use your conscious mind. Your conscious mind is good at handling specific tasks that require exact answers. But when you have to deal with a lot of information and confusing choices, your unconscious mind is better at figuring things out. This is because your unconscious mind can process more information at once, like a powerful computer that can find solutions to tough problems.

So, according to this theory, taking breaks helps your conscious mind rest, which allows your unconscious mind to work on your hardest problems. This means that stepping away from work doesn’t just mean you’re being less productive; it actually helps you think in different ways.

In another study from 2008, researchers looked at how taking a walk can help you focus better. They split people into two groups. One group walked in a peaceful, wooded area, while the other group walked in a busy city. After their walks, both groups had to do a tricky task that tested their concentration. The group that walked in nature did about 20% better on the task. Even when they switched locations the next week, the nature group still performed better. It showed that it wasn’t the people that mattered, but the calming effect of walking in nature that helped them concentrate.
