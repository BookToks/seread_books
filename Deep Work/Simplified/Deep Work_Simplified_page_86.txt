Dijksterhuis and his team found that people often make better decisions when they let their unconscious mind work on problems. This idea is called unconscious thought theory (UTT). Basically, it says that when you need to follow strict rules, like in math, you have to use your conscious mind. But when decisions are complicated and involve a lot of information, your unconscious mind can handle it better. 

This is because your unconscious brain can process more information at once than your conscious brain. Think of your conscious mind like a regular computer that runs specific programs for simple tasks. In contrast, your unconscious mind is like Google, which can search through tons of data to find useful answers to tough questions. 

So, taking breaks can actually help your unconscious mind work on tricky problems while your conscious mind rests. This means that stepping away from work doesn’t just mean you’re being less productive; it can actually help you think in different ways.

In another study from 2008, researchers split people into two groups. One group walked in a peaceful forest, while the other walked in a busy city. Afterward, they had to do a challenging memory task. The group that walked in nature did much better—up to 20% better! This showed that being in nature helped them focus more, not just the people themselves.
