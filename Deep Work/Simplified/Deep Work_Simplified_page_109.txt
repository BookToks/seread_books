I want to explain how most people decide to use the Internet, especially Facebook. Back in 2013, I wrote an article about why I never joined Facebook. Even though I was just sharing my thoughts, a lot of people felt defensive and started explaining why they liked using it. Here are some of their reasons:

“Facebook was fun for me at first. I could see what my friends were doing and share funny pictures and comments.”

“When I joined, I didn’t really know why. I got curious and joined a writing group where I improved my writing and made some great friends.”

“I use Facebook because many people I knew from high school are on there.”

What stands out to me about these responses is that they seem pretty small. I believe the first person enjoys Facebook, but I doubt they were super bored before joining. They probably had other ways to have fun even if Facebook didn’t exist. It seems like Facebook just added one more option for entertainment, which isn’t that special.

Another person talked about making friends in a writing group. I believe those friendships are real, but they might not be very deep since they’re just based on chatting online. There’s nothing wrong with those kinds of friendships, but they probably aren’t the most important part of this person’s social life. The same goes for the person who reconnected with high school friends. It’s nice, but it’s not the main thing that makes them feel connected or happy.

I’m not saying these benefits aren’t real or important. They are, but they seem pretty small and random. If you asked someone why they use the Internet or email, their reasons would likely be much stronger and more convincing. You might think that any small benefit is enough to keep using something like Facebook, and I call this the “any-benefit” mindset, where any little advantage seems good enough.
