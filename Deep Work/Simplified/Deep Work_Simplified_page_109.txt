Most people on the Internet have a certain way of deciding what to use. Back in 2013, I learned more about this when I wrote an article explaining why I never joined Facebook. The article was meant to share my thoughts, not to criticize anyone. Still, many readers felt defensive and started explaining why they liked using Facebook.

Some said things like, “I joined Facebook for fun. I can see what my friends are doing and share funny pictures.” Others mentioned, “I didn’t really know why I joined at first, but I found a writing forum that helped me improve my skills and make friends.” Another person said, “I use Facebook because a lot of my high school friends are on there.”

What stood out to me about these responses is that they seem pretty small. For example, I believe the first person enjoys Facebook, but they probably had other ways to have fun before joining. I think they would still find ways to entertain themselves even if Facebook disappeared. So, Facebook just added one more option for entertainment, which isn’t that special.

The second commenter talked about making friends in a writing forum. I believe those friendships exist, but they’re probably not super deep since they’re mostly about chatting online. There’s nothing wrong with these kinds of friendships, but they might not be the most important part of this person’s social life. The same goes for the person who reconnected with high school friends; it’s nice, but it’s not the main source of their happiness.

I’m not saying these benefits aren’t real or valuable. They are, but they seem pretty minor and random. If you asked someone why they use the Internet or email, their reasons would be much stronger and clearer. You might think that any little benefit is worth it, and that’s what I call the “any-benefit” mindset. It means that if you find even a small advantage in using something like Facebook, you think it’s okay to use it.
