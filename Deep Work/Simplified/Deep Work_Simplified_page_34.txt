Every day, a lot of e-mails are sent, and each one has a certain number of words. Tom Cochran looked at how much time employees spent typing and reading these e-mails, along with their salaries. He found out that Atlantic Media was spending over a million dollars a year just to handle e-mails. Each e-mail cost the company about ninety-five cents in labor. Cochran pointed out that what seems like a free way to communicate actually costs a lot, like buying a small private jet.

Cochran's findings show that even simple questions about e-mail habits can be really complicated to answer. To figure it out, he had to survey the whole company and gather a lot of data from their IT systems. He also needed salary info and details about how fast people type and read. After running all this data through a model, he got his results. But even then, it was hard to tell how much value all that e-mailing actually brought to the company compared to its costs.

This situation is similar to many behaviors that can either help or hurt focused work. Even though we know distractions can be costly and deep work is valuable, measuring these effects is tough. This isn't just about e-mails; as jobs get more complex, it's harder to see how much each person contributes. The economist Thomas Piketty talked about this in his research on why executive salaries have grown so much. He argued that it's really hard to measure how much each person helps a company. Because of this, sometimes salaries can be way too high compared to what someone actually produces. While some of Piketty's ideas are debated, many agree that measuring individual contributions is getting harder.

So, we shouldn't expect to easily see how behaviors that hurt deep work affect a company's profits. As Cochran found out, these effects are in a tricky area that's hard to measure, which I call the "metric black hole." 

Just because it's tough to measure the impact of deep work doesn't mean businesses will ignore it. There are plenty of examples of behaviors that are hard to quantify but still matter a lot.
