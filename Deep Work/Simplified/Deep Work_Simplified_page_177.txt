I’m using the word “individualized” a bit loosely here. The idea of working alone doesn’t just apply to people who do things by themselves. 

There are also great examples of teamwork, like songwriting duos such as Rodgers and Hammerstein or inventors like the Wright brothers. 

What I really mean is that this way of thinking works best for people who can focus on clear goals without the extra responsibilities that come with being part of a big group.
