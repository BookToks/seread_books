I’m using the word “individualized” a bit loosely here. The idea of working alone doesn’t just apply to people who do everything by themselves. There are also great examples of teamwork where a small group works together. For instance, think about famous songwriting duos like Rodgers and Hammerstein or inventors like the Wright brothers. What I really mean is that this way of thinking works best for people who can focus on specific goals without the extra responsibilities that come with being part of a big group.
