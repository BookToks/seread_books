immediately “closes the loop” on the project you're working on. When you start a project by sending or getting an email, it sticks in your mind—it’s something you have to deal with later. This method helps you finish that open task right away. By going through the whole process, adding important tasks to your to-do list and calendar, and updating the other person involved, you can free up your mind from the stress of that project. Less mental clutter means you can think more clearly.

At first, writing process-focused emails might feel weird. It means you have to think more about what you want to say before you write it. It might seem like you’re spending more time on emails, but remember that those extra two or three minutes now will save you a lot of time later when you don’t have to deal with extra messages.

Another thing is that these emails can sound stiff and too formal. Most people expect a friendly tone in emails, which doesn’t always match the more structured way of writing used in process-focused emails. If this worries you, try starting your emails with a friendly introduction. You can even separate the formal part of the email with a line or label it “Next Steps” so it feels more fitting.

In the end, these small changes are worth it. By thinking more about what you’re really saying in your emails, you’ll reduce the negative effects of email on your ability to focus on important work.

Tip #3: Don’t Respond

When I was a grad student at MIT, I got to meet some really famous professors. I noticed that many of them had a unique way of handling emails: they usually didn’t reply right away. 

I learned that their thinking behind this was simple: it’s up to the person sending the email to show that a reply is worth it. If you didn’t make a strong case and make it easy for the professor to respond, you probably wouldn’t get an answer. 

For example, if someone sent a vague email, many of these professors wouldn’t bother replying.
