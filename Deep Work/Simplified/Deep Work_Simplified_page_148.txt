When you start a project through an email, it sticks in your mind. It’s like something you need to deal with later. This method helps you finish the project quickly. By writing everything down, like tasks and deadlines, and updating the other person involved, you can clear your mind. Less mental clutter means you can think better.

At first, writing these kinds of emails might feel weird. They make you think more about what you want to say before you hit send. It might seem like you’re spending more time on emails, but those extra minutes can save you a lot of time later by cutting down on back-and-forth messages.

Also, these emails can sound too formal or stiff. Most people prefer a casual tone in emails, which doesn’t always match the organized style of process-focused messages. If that worries you, try adding a friendly introduction before you get into the details. You can even label the detailed part as “Next Steps” to make it feel less awkward.

In the end, putting in a little extra thought at the beginning is worth it. By being clear about what you want in your emails, you can avoid wasting time on unnecessary replies.

Tip #3: Don’t Feel Pressured to Reply

When I was a grad student at MIT, I noticed that many smart professors had a unique way of handling emails: they often didn’t reply right away. I learned that they believed it’s up to the person sending the email to make it worth the receiver’s time to respond. If the sender didn’t make a strong case or didn’t keep it easy for the professor to reply, they probably wouldn’t get a response.

For example, if someone sent a vague email, many professors wouldn’t bother to reply.
