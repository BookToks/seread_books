Chapter One  
Deep Work Is Valuable  

As Election Day got closer in 2012, a lot more people started visiting the New York Times website, which usually happens during big national events. But this time, there was something different.  

A huge part of that traffic—over 70 percent, according to some reports—was going to one specific blog. It wasn’t a breaking news story or an article by one of their famous writers; it was a blog by a guy named Nate Silver, who was really into baseball stats and predicting elections. Less than a year later, ESPN and ABC News offered Silver a big deal to leave the Times, even though the Times tried to keep him by promising him a team of writers. Silver’s new job would involve everything from sports to weather to news segments and even the Academy Awards. Even though some people question how he does his predictions, most agree that in 2012, this 35-year-old data expert was a big success.  

Another success story is David Heinemeier Hansson, a computer programming genius who created Ruby on Rails, a tool that helps build popular websites like Twitter and Hulu. Hansson is also a partner at a well-known company called Basecamp (which was called 37signals until 2014). He doesn’t share how much money he makes from Basecamp or other projects, but we can guess it’s a lot since he splits his time between Chicago, Malibu, and Marbella, Spain, where he even races high-performance cars.  

The third success is John Doerr, a partner at a famous venture capital firm in Silicon Valley called Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Doerr has invested in many important companies that are driving today’s tech revolution, like Twitter, Google, Amazon, Netscape, and Sun Microsystems. His investments have paid off big time, and as of now, he’s worth over $3 billion.  

So, why have Silver, Hansson, and Doerr been so successful? There are two main reasons.
