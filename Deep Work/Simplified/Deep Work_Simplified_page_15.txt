Chapter One  
Deep Work Is Valuable  

As Election Day got closer in 2012, a lot more people started visiting the New York Times website, which usually happens during important events. But this time, something was different. A huge part of that traffic—over 70 percent according to some reports—was going to one specific blog. It wasn’t a breaking news story or an article from a famous writer; it was a blog by a guy named Nate Silver, who was really into baseball stats and predicting elections. Less than a year later, ESPN and ABC News offered Silver a big deal to leave the Times, even though the Times tried to keep him by promising him a team of writers. Silver’s work would soon cover everything from sports to weather to news segments and even the Oscars. While some people argue about how accurate his methods are, most agree that this 35-year-old data expert was a big success in the economy back in 2012.  

Another successful person is David Heinemeier Hansson, a computer programming genius who created Ruby on Rails, a tool that helps build websites. This tool is used by some of the most popular sites like Twitter and Hulu. Hansson is also a partner at Basecamp, a well-known development company. He doesn’t talk much about how much money he makes, but we can guess it’s a lot since he splits his time between Chicago, Malibu, and Marbella, Spain, where he even races cars.  

The last example of someone who has done really well in the economy is John Doerr, a partner at a famous venture capital firm in Silicon Valley called Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Doerr has helped fund many important companies that are driving today’s tech revolution, like Twitter, Google, Amazon, Netscape, and Sun Microsystems. His investments have paid off big time, and his net worth is over $3 billion right now.  

Why have Silver, Hansson, and Doerr been so successful? There are two main reasons.
