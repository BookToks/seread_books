Email me everything you remember about our talk about the problem sometime next week. Once I get your message, I’ll create a shared folder for the project and add a document that sums up what you sent me along with my own memories of our discussion. In that document, I’ll point out the two or three best next steps we can take.

We can work on those next steps for a few weeks and then check in. I think we should schedule a phone call for a month from now. I’ve listed some dates and times when I’m free for a call. When you send back your notes, let me know which date and time works best for you, and we’ll take that as confirmation for the call. I’m excited to tackle this problem together.

Thanks for getting back to me. I’ll read the draft of the article and send you an edited version with comments on Friday (the 10th). In the version I send back, I’ll fix what I can and add comments to show you where I think you can make improvements. After that, you should have everything you need to finish and submit the final draft, so you don’t need to reply to this message or follow up with me unless there’s a problem.

When I wrote these example replies, I first figured out the project we were discussing. The word “project” can mean big things like working on research, or smaller tasks like setting up a coffee meeting. I took a moment to think about how we can move from where we are now to where we want to be with fewer emails. Then, I wrote a reply that clearly explains this process and our current status. These examples focus on email replies, but the same idea works when writing a new email from scratch.

Using a process-focused approach to email can really help save your time and attention. First, it cuts down the number of emails in your inbox, sometimes a lot. For example, scheduling a coffee meeting can easily turn into many messages over several days if you’re not careful. This means you spend less time in your inbox and use less mental energy when you do check it.
