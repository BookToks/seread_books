Sometime next week, send me an email with everything you remember about our talk on the problem. Once I get your message, I’ll create a shared folder for the project and add a document that sums up what you sent me along with my own memories of our discussion. In that document, I’ll point out the two or three best next steps we can take.

After that, we can work on those steps for a few weeks and then check back in. I think we should plan a phone call for a month from now to discuss this. Below, I’ve listed some dates and times when I’m free for a call. When you reply with your notes, let me know which date and time works best for you, and we’ll take that as confirmation for the call. I’m excited to dive into this problem.

Thanks for getting back to me. I’m going to read the draft of the article and send you back an edited version with comments on Friday (the 10th). In the version I send back, I’ll fix what I can and add comments to highlight areas where I think you should make improvements. By then, you should have everything you need to polish and submit the final draft, so you don’t need to reply to this message or follow up with me after I send the edits—unless there’s a problem.

When I wrote these sample responses, I first figured out the project mentioned in the message. The word “project” can mean big things, like working on a research problem, or smaller tasks, like setting up a coffee meeting. Then, I took a minute to think about how we can get from where we are now to where we want to be with as few messages as possible. Finally, I wrote a reply that clearly explains this process and our current status. These examples focus on replying to an email, but the same idea works when writing a new email from scratch.

Using a process-focused approach to email can really help save your time and attention. There are two main reasons for this. First, it cuts down on the number of emails in your inbox—sometimes a lot (even something simple like scheduling a coffee meeting can turn into a bunch of messages over several days if you’re not careful). This means you spend less time in your inbox and use less brainpower when you do check it.

Second, borrowing a term from David Allen, a good process-focused message...
