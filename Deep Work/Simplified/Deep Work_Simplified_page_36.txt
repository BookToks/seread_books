predicted, based on the link between depth and skill growth mentioned earlier, and maybe most importantly, “a better product for the client.”

This raises an interesting question: Why do so many companies, like the Boston Consulting Group, encourage constant communication even if, as Perlow found in her study, it can harm employees’ well-being and productivity, and probably doesn’t help the company’s profits? I think the answer lies in how people behave at work.

The Principle of Least Resistance: In a work environment, if we don’t get clear feedback on how our actions affect the company’s success, we tend to do what’s easiest at the moment.

Going back to why companies keep pushing for constant communication, the answer is that it’s easier. There are two main reasons for this. The first is about getting what you need quickly. If you work somewhere where you can get answers or information right away, it makes your life easier—at least for the moment. If you couldn’t rely on quick responses, you’d have to plan ahead, be more organized, and wait longer for what you asked for. This would make your daily work life tougher, even if it led to better results in the long run. The rise of instant messaging at work shows how this mindset has gone to an extreme. If getting an email reply within an hour is easy, then getting an answer through instant messaging in under a minute is even better.

The second reason why constant communication makes life easier is that it allows you to run your day based on your inbox—quickly responding to the latest messages while ignoring others that pile up, all while feeling productive. If email became less central to your workday, you’d need to think more about what to work on and for how long. This kind of planning is tough. For example, David Allen’s Getting Things Done method is a respected way to manage different tasks at work. It suggests a fifteen-step flowchart to help decide what to do next! It’s way easier to just jump into the latest email thread.

I’m focusing on constant connectivity as an example in this discussion, but it’s just
