a part of a bigger issue. Many companies focus on being connected all the time, even if it can make employees feel stressed and less productive. So, why do they keep doing this? 

One reason is the Principle of Least Resistance. In simple terms, when people don’t get clear feedback on how their actions affect the company, they tend to choose the easiest option. 

For example, if you can quickly get answers to your questions at work, it feels easier. But if you didn’t have that quick access, you’d have to plan better and wait for responses, which would make your job harder. Instant messaging has taken this idea to the extreme. Getting a quick reply is great, but it can make you rely on it too much.

Another reason why being constantly connected is easier is that it encourages people to work straight from their inboxes. Responding to emails right away feels productive, even if it means ignoring other important tasks. If emails weren’t the main focus, you’d have to think more about what to do and how long to spend on it, which is tough. For instance, there’s a popular system called Getting Things Done that helps people manage their tasks, but it’s complicated. It’s way simpler to just reply to the latest email.

I’m using constant connectivity as an example, but it’s just one part of a larger problem in the workplace.
