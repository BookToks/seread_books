stay the same. In a Wall Street Journal article, business writer Laura Vanderkam shared some interesting facts. A survey by the National Sleep Foundation showed that Americans think they sleep about seven hours a night. But when people actually measured their sleep, it turned out to be more like 8.6 hours. Another study found that people who said they worked sixty to sixty-four hours a week were really only working around forty-four hours. Those who claimed to work more than seventy-five hours were actually working less than fifty-five.

These examples highlight an important issue: we often go through our day without really thinking about how we spend our time. This can be a problem. If you don’t take a moment to check how much time you spend on important tasks versus less important ones, it’s easy for unimportant stuff to fill up your schedule. To help with this, you should get into the habit of pausing and asking yourself, “What should I focus on right now?” The strategy I’ll explain next might seem a bit extreme at first, but it can really help you make the most of your time for deep work: 

Schedule every minute of your day. 

Here’s what to do: At the start of each workday, grab a new page in a notebook just for this. On the left side of the page, write down each hour of the day, covering the hours you usually work. Now, here’s the key part: break your work hours into blocks and assign tasks to those blocks. For example, you could set aside nine a.m. to eleven a.m. for writing a client’s press release. Draw a box around those hours and write “press release” inside it. 

Not every block has to be for work tasks. You can also set aside time for lunch or breaks. To keep it organized, make sure each block is at least thirty minutes long. This way, instead of making a tiny box for every little task like replying to an email or asking someone about a report, you can group similar tasks together into bigger blocks. You might find it helpful to draw a line from a task block to the right side of the page where you can list all the smaller tasks you want to do during that time. 

When you finish scheduling your day, every minute should have a purpose. You’ve basically given every minute of your workday a job. Now, as you go through your day, use this schedule to keep you on track. 

This is where most people start to struggle. Two things can happen.
