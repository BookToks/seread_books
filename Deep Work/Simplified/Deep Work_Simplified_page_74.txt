The value of cabins isn’t just in how nice they are; it’s really about the effort put into making them so people can write better.

Not every big effort has to last forever. For example, William Shockley, a physicist at Bell Labs, got really competitive when he missed out on inventing the transistor. While he was away on another project, two of his team members made the discovery. So, Shockley locked himself in a hotel room in Chicago, where he was supposed to be for a conference. He didn’t leave until he figured out a better design that he had been thinking about. Once he was done, he sent his notes back to his lab in New Jersey so a colleague could add them to his notebook and mark the time of the new idea. This design helped him win part of a Nobel Prize later on.

Another cool story is about Peter Shankman, an entrepreneur and social media expert. He travels a lot for speaking gigs and found that flying at thirty thousand feet was a great time for him to focus. He wrote in a blog that being stuck in a seat with no distractions helped him think clearly. After realizing this, he signed a book deal that gave him only two weeks to finish the whole book. To meet this tight deadline, he did something unusual. He bought a round-trip business-class ticket to Tokyo. He wrote the entire flight to Japan, had an espresso in the lounge when he got there, and then flew back, writing the whole way. He returned home just thirty hours later with his completed manuscript. He said the trip cost $4,000 but was totally worth it.

In all these stories, it’s not just about changing your surroundings or finding quiet. The real key is how serious you are about the task. Whether it’s going to a cool place to focus on writing, taking a week off just to think, or locking yourself in a hotel room to finish an important invention, these big moves show how committed you are. Sometimes, to really dive deep into something, you have to make a big effort first.
