isolation made it hard for journalists to find him after he won the Nobel Prize. J.K. Rowling, on the other hand, does use a computer, but she stayed off social media while writing her Harry Potter books. This was during a time when social media was becoming really popular. Her team finally created a Twitter account for her in late 2009 while she was working on The Casual Vacancy. For the first year and a half, her only tweet said: “This is the real me, but you won’t be hearing from me often I am afraid, as pen and paper is my priority at the moment.”

Deep work isn’t just for people from the past or those who don’t like technology. Bill Gates, the CEO of Microsoft, used to have “Think Weeks” twice a year. During these weeks, he would go to a cabin by a lake to read and think without distractions. In 1995, during one of these weeks, he wrote his famous “Internet Tidal Wave” memo that made Microsoft pay attention to a new company called Netscape Communications. Ironically, Neal Stephenson, a well-known author who helped shape how we think about the Internet, is really hard to contact online. His website doesn’t have an email address and includes an essay explaining why he is not good at using social media. He once said, “If I organize my life so I have long, uninterrupted time, I can write novels. If I get interrupted a lot, what do I end up with? Instead of a novel that lasts a long time, I just have a bunch of emails I’ve sent to different people.”

It’s important to note how many successful people value deep work because it’s very different from how most modern workers act. Many knowledge workers are forgetting how important it is to focus deeply. The reason for this is clear: network tools. This includes things like email, texting, social media like Twitter and Facebook, and entertaining websites like BuzzFeed and Reddit. Because of these tools, along with easy access through smartphones and computers, most workers have their attention split into tiny pieces. A study from McKinsey in 2012 found that the average knowledge worker spends over 60 percent of their workweek on electronic communication and searching the Internet, with nearly 30 percent of their time just reading and replying to emails.

This split attention makes it hard to do deep work, which needs long stretches of focused thinking. However, modern knowledge workers...
