Focus on improving the things you can control right now that will help you reach your long-term goals. 

If you're trying to do deep work, it's easy to see what matters most: the time you spend really concentrating on your important goal. For example, when I was doing my academic research, I used to look at things like how many papers I published each year. But those numbers didn’t really help me with my daily work because there was nothing I could do right away to change them. When I started tracking how many hours I spent in deep work, it made a big difference. Every extra hour of deep work showed up in my count, and that felt relevant to what I was doing every day.

Discipline #3: Keep a Scoreboard

The authors of 4DX say, “People play differently when they’re keeping score.” They explain that if you want your team to care about your important goal, they need a public place to track their progress. This scoreboard creates some friendly competition and helps them stay focused, even when other things try to distract them. When the team sees they’re doing well, they get motivated to keep it up.

In the last section, I mentioned that for someone focused on deep work, the hours spent working deeply should be the main thing to track. So, the scoreboard should be something visible in your workspace that shows how many deep work hours you have.

When I first tried out 4DX, I came up with a simple way to make this scoreboard. I took a piece of thick paper and divided it into rows for each week of the semester. I wrote the dates on each row and taped it next to my computer so I couldn’t miss it. As the week went on, I kept track of my deep work hours with tally marks in that week’s row. To make it even more motivating, whenever I reached an important goal in my academic work, like solving a tough problem, I would circle the tally mark for that hour.

This did two things. First, it helped me see how my deep work hours added up and made me feel more connected to my progress.
