Focus on improving the things you can control right now that will help you reach your long-term goals. 

If you're trying to do deep work, it's easy to see what you should measure: the time you spend really focusing on your most important goal. For example, when I worked on my research, I used to look at things like how many papers I published each year. But those numbers didn’t help me change what I did every day because they didn’t show immediate results. Once I started tracking how many hours I spent in deep work, it became much more relevant. Every extra hour of deep work showed up on my list right away.

**Discipline #3: Keep a Scoreboard That Matters**  
The authors of 4DX say, “People play differently when they’re keeping score.” They explain that if you want your team to stay focused on a big goal, they need a visible place to track their progress. This scoreboard creates competition and helps everyone stay focused, even when other things try to distract them. When the team sees their success, they get more motivated to keep it up.

In the last section, I said that for someone focused on deep work, the hours spent working deeply should be the main thing to track. So, the scoreboard should show how many deep work hours you have. 

When I first tried using 4DX, I came up with a simple way to make this scoreboard. I took a piece of thick paper and divided it into rows for each week of the semester. I labeled each row with the week’s dates and taped it next to my computer so I wouldn’t forget about it. As the week went on, I counted the hours I spent in deep work and marked them with tally marks in that week’s row. To keep myself motivated, whenever I hit an important milestone in my paper (like solving a tough problem), I would circle the tally mark for that hour.

This helped me in two ways. First, it made me really feel the connection between the hours I spent in deep work and my progress.
