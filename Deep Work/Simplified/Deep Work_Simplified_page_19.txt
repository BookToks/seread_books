This passage talks about how a small number of people can create a lot of value in today's economy, especially with technology. It mentions that the people who own machines and technology are making a lot of money, which is unusual. A venture capitalist even said that everyone wants to have their job because it’s so valuable.

The main idea is that technology is changing our economy in a big way. There are three groups of people who will do really well in this new economy: those who can work well with smart machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those who have money to invest. While these groups aren’t the only ones who will succeed, they are important to focus on. If you can be part of one of these groups, you’re likely to do well. If not, you might still find success, but it could be harder.

Now, the big question is: how can you become part of these successful groups? I have to be honest and say I don’t have a quick way to get rich like some famous investors. However, the other two groups are reachable. Next, we’ll talk about how to get into these groups.

To succeed in the new economy, I’ve identified two groups that are likely to thrive: those who can work creatively with smart machines and those who are top performers in their field. 

So, what do you need to do to get into these high-paying areas? I believe there are two key skills you should focus on:

1. The ability to learn difficult things quickly.
2. The ability to produce high-quality work fast.
