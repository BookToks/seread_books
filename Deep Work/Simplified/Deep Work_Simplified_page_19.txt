This company only has thirteen employees. When has there ever been a time in history when so few people could create so much value? Because there’s so little work needed, the money made mostly goes to the owners of the machines, which in this case are the investors. It’s no surprise that a venture capitalist I talked to said, “Everyone wants my job.”

Let’s connect what we’ve talked about so far: Right now, experts say that technology is changing our economy in a big way. In this new economy, three groups will have a big advantage: people who can work well with smart machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those who have money to invest. 

To be clear, this big change in the economy, pointed out by economists like Brynjolfsson, McAfee, and Cowen, isn’t the only important trend right now. The three groups I mentioned aren’t the only ones who will succeed, but they are important. If you can be part of any of these groups, you’ll do well. If you can’t, you might still do okay, but your situation could be riskier.

Now we have to ask the big question: How do you become part of these winning groups? I have to be honest and say I don’t have a quick way to make a lot of money and become the next big investor. (If I did, I probably wouldn’t share it in a book.) However, the other two groups are reachable. Figuring out how to join them is what we’ll talk about next.

How to Become a Winner in the New Economy

I just mentioned two groups that are likely to succeed and that I think you can reach: those who can work creatively with smart machines and those who are top performers in their field. 

So, what’s the key to getting into these high-paying areas of the growing digital world? I believe there are two main skills that are really important.

Two Key Skills for Succeeding in the New Economy

1. The ability to quickly learn difficult things.
2. The ability to produce high-quality work quickly.
