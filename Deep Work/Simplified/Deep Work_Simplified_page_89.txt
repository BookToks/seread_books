During your workday, you use up a lot of your energy and focus. By the time evening comes, you’re usually too tired to do any serious work. If you try to work at night, you’ll probably end up doing easy tasks that don’t really help your career. So, skipping evening work isn’t really a big deal.

The reasons I just mentioned show why it’s important to have a clear end to your workday. Let’s talk about how to make this work for you.

To make this plan work, you need to promise yourself that once your workday is over, you won’t let any work stuff distract you. This means no checking emails or looking at work websites. Even a quick peek can lead to distractions that stick with you for a long time. For example, if you see a stressful email on a Saturday, it can ruin your whole weekend.

Another important part of this plan is having a strict shutdown routine at the end of your workday. This routine should help you go over everything you didn’t finish and make sure you have a plan for each task. You should either have a solid plan for finishing it later or write it down somewhere you’ll remember. This routine should be a series of steps you always follow. When you finish, say a phrase that signals it’s time to stop working (I say, “Shutdown complete”). It might sound silly, but it helps your brain know it’s okay to stop thinking about work.

To give you a better idea, let me share my own shutdown routine. I started using it when I was working on my doctoral dissertation, and I still use it today. First, I check my email one last time to make sure there’s nothing urgent. Then, I write down any new tasks that I need to remember in my official task list. I use Google Docs for this because I can access it from any computer, but you can use whatever works for you.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** It's important to have a clear end to your workday to avoid distractions and low-value tasks. Create a shutdown routine to review unfinished work and signal to yourself that it's time to relax. This helps you focus better during work hours and enjoy your free time.
