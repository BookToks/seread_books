during your workday. By the time evening comes, you’re too tired to work well. Any work you do at night won’t help your career much; it’ll probably just be easy stuff that doesn’t take much energy. So, if you skip working in the evening, you’re not really missing out on anything important.

The three reasons I just mentioned show why it’s a good idea to set a clear end to your workday. Now, let’s talk about how to make this work.

To make this plan work, you need to promise yourself that once your workday is over, you won’t let any work stuff distract you. This means no checking emails or looking at work websites. Even a quick peek at work can lead to distractions that stick with you for a long time. For example, many people know what it’s like to see a stressful email on a Saturday morning and then think about it all weekend.

Another important part of making this work is to have a specific shutdown routine at the end of your workday. This routine helps you make sure you’re really done for the day. You should check every unfinished task or project and decide if you have a plan to finish it or if you’ve written it down somewhere to deal with later. This process should be a set of steps you always follow in order. When you finish, say a phrase that means you’re done (I say, “Shutdown complete”). It might sound silly, but it helps your brain know it’s time to stop thinking about work for the rest of the day.

To give you a clearer idea, let me share my own shutdown routine. I started this when I was working on my doctoral dissertation and have used it ever since. First, I check my email one last time to make sure there’s nothing urgent to respond to before the day ends. Next, I write down any new tasks that are on my mind or that I jotted down earlier into my official task list. (I use Google Docs for my task lists because I can access them from any computer, but the tool you use isn’t that important.) Once I have these task lists...
