During your workday, you use up a lot of your energy. By the time evening comes, you’re too tired to do any serious work. If you try to work at night, you’ll probably just end up doing easy tasks that don’t really help your career. So, skipping evening work isn’t a big deal.

The reasons I just mentioned show why it’s important to have a clear end to your workday. Now, let’s talk about how to make this work for you.

To make this plan work, you need to promise yourself that once your workday is over, you won’t let any work stuff creep back in. This means no checking emails or looking at work-related websites. Even a quick peek at a work email can distract you for a long time. For example, if you read a stressful email on Saturday morning, it might bother you all weekend.

Another important part of this plan is to have a strict shutdown routine at the end of your workday. This routine should help you check off any unfinished tasks or projects. For each task, you should either have a solid plan to finish it or write it down somewhere you’ll remember later. Think of it like a checklist: steps you follow one after the other. When you finish, say a phrase that means you’re done (I say, “Shutdown complete”). It might sound silly, but it helps your brain know it’s time to stop thinking about work.

To give you a better idea, let me share my own shutdown routine, which I started when I was working on my doctoral dissertation and still use today. First, I check my email one last time to make sure there’s nothing urgent before the day ends. Next, I write down any new tasks I thought of during the day into my official task list. I use Google Docs for this because I can access it from any computer, but you can use whatever works for you.
