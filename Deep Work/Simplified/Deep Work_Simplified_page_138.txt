If you have a job where you send emails and go to meetings for thirty hours a week, your boss will probably realize that you need to say no to some things and simplify others. This might make things a bit harder for everyone, but the main goal of a business is to create value, not to make life super easy for employees.

If you work for yourself, looking at how much time you really spend on important tasks can be eye-opening. You might find that you’re not actually doing much that creates value in your busy schedule. Knowing these numbers can help you feel confident about cutting back on the less important activities that waste your time. Without this information, it’s tough to say no to any opportunity that might seem good. You might think, “I have to be on Twitter!,” “I need to keep my Facebook active!,” or “I have to update my blog!” It can feel lazy to say no to any of these things when you look at them one by one.

It’s important to keep these less important activities limited so you can spend more time on the work that really helps your business grow.

When you ask your boss about how much shallow work you should do, they might not say, “You should spend all your time on shallow work!” But they might suggest that you do enough shallow work to get your tasks done quickly. If that’s the case, it means your job doesn’t really support deep work, which is important for success today. You should thank your boss for their input and start thinking about how to find a new job that values deeper work.
