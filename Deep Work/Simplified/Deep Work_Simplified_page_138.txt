If you have a job where you send emails and go to meetings for thirty hours a week, your boss will probably realize that you need to say no to some things and simplify others. This might make things a bit harder for everyone, including you and your coworkers. But remember, the main goal of a business is to create value, not to make life easy for its employees.

If you work for yourself, looking at your schedule will show you how little time you actually spend creating value. These numbers can help you feel confident about cutting back on activities that waste your time. Without these numbers, it’s tough to say no to any opportunity that seems like it could be good. You might think, “I have to be on Twitter!” or “I need to keep my Facebook active!” Saying no to any of these feels like being lazy. Instead, if you focus on a balance between shallow and deep work, you can feel less guilty about saying no. This way, you can still explore many opportunities while making sure you have enough time for the important work that helps your business grow.

Sometimes, when you ask your boss about this, the answer might be clear. No boss will say, “You should spend all your time on easy tasks!” But they might say something like, “Do enough easy work to get things done quickly.” This means that the job doesn’t really support deep work, which is important for success today. If that’s the case, thank your boss for their input and start thinking about how to find a new job that values deeper work.
