suspicion. No one thinks Ric Furrer is weird for not using Facebook, but if a knowledge worker does the same thing, people call them eccentric (I know this from my own experience).

Just because it’s not obvious how deep work connects to meaning in knowledge jobs doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. The point of this chapter is to show you that deep work can bring just as much satisfaction in today’s information world as it does in hands-on jobs. I’ll make three points to back this up. These points will go from specific to general: starting with how our brains work, then looking at our feelings, and finally discussing bigger ideas. I’ll prove that no matter how you look at depth and knowledge work, choosing to focus deeply can give you the same sense of meaning that craftspeople like Ric Furrer feel. So, the main idea of this last chapter in Part 1 is that living deeply is not just good for making money, but it’s also a fulfilling way to live.

A Neurological Argument for Depth

The science writer Winifred Gallagher found a link between attention and happiness after a scary experience—she was diagnosed with cancer, and not just any cancer, but a really bad kind. In her 2009 book *Rapt*, she remembers walking out of the hospital after hearing the news and feeling a strong urge: “This disease wants my attention, but I’m going to focus on my life instead.”

The cancer treatment was tough, but Gallagher noticed that by choosing to focus on the good things in her life—like movies, walks, and a martini at 6:30—she felt surprisingly okay. Even though her situation should have made her feel scared and sad, she found that her life was often quite enjoyable.

Curious about this, Gallagher wanted to learn more about how attention—what we choose to pay attention to and what we ignore—affects our lives. After five years of writing about science, she became convinced that she discovered a “grand unified theory” of the mind: 

Like fingers pointing to the moon, different fields like anthropology, education, behavioral economics, and family counseling all suggest that managing our attention well is essential for a good life and is key to improving almost every part of it.
