No one would blame Ric Furrer for not using Facebook, but if someone who works with information decides not to use it, people think they’re weird (I know this from my own experience). 

Even though it might not seem obvious, deep work can still be really rewarding in jobs that deal with information, just like it is in hands-on jobs. This chapter will show you that deep work can bring as much happiness in an information job as it does in a craft job. I’ll make three points to back this up. These points will start small and then get bigger: first, I’ll talk about the brain, then about feelings, and finally about big ideas. No matter how you look at the connection between depth and knowledge work, it’s clear that focusing on deep work instead of shallow work can give you the same sense of purpose that craftsmen like Ric Furrer feel. So, the main idea of this chapter is that living deeply is not just good for making money, but it also makes life more fulfilling.

A Neurological Argument for Depth

Winifred Gallagher, a science writer, found a link between attention and happiness after she got a scary cancer diagnosis. She didn’t just have cancer; it was a really bad kind. In her 2009 book, *Rapt*, she remembers leaving the hospital and realizing, “This disease wants to take all my focus, but I’m going to focus on my life instead.” The treatment was tough, but Gallagher noticed that by concentrating on the good things in her life—like movies, walks, and a martini at 6:30—she felt surprisingly happy. Even though she should have been scared and sad, her life was often enjoyable.

Curious about this, Gallagher wanted to learn more about how attention—what we choose to focus on and what we ignore—affects our lives. After five years of reporting on science, she believed she discovered a “grand unified theory” of the mind. Different fields, from anthropology to education and even family counseling, suggest that managing our attention well is crucial for a good life and can improve almost every part of it.
