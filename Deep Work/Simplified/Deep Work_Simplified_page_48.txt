We can take a step back and use Gallagher’s big idea to understand how deep work helps us live better lives. His theory says that what you focus on shapes your world. So, think about what happens when you spend a lot of time on deep tasks. Deep work feels important, whether you’re a blacksmith making a sword or a programmer working on code. Gallagher believes that if you spend enough time doing this kind of work, your mind will see your world as full of meaning and significance.

But there’s another important benefit to focusing hard on your work: it helps you ignore all the little annoying things in life that can distract you. The psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who we’ll talk more about later, points out that when you concentrate really well, you don’t have time to think about unimportant stuff or worry about problems. This is especially true in jobs that rely on constant internet access, which can be super distracting. If you give too much attention to these distractions, they can take away the meaning from what you’re trying to focus on.

To show you what I mean, let’s look at my own experience. Think about the last five emails I sent before I started writing this chapter. Here are the subject lines and what they were about:

• Re: URGENT calnewport Brand Registration Confirmation.  
This was about a scam where a company tries to trick website owners into registering their domain in China. I got annoyed with their spam and replied, telling them their scam would be better if they spelled “website” right.

• Re: S R.  
This was a chat with a family member about an article he saw in the Wall Street Journal.

• Re: Important Advice.  
This email was part of a discussion about the best ways to invest for retirement.
