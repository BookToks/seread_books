We can take a step back and use Gallagher’s big idea to understand how deep work helps us live better lives. His theory says that your world is shaped by what you focus on. So, think about what happens when you spend a lot of time on important tasks. Deep work feels serious and meaningful, whether you’re a blacksmith making a sword or a programmer improving a computer program. Gallagher believes that if you spend enough time in this focused state, your mind will see your world as full of meaning and importance.

But there’s another important benefit to really focusing on your work. When you concentrate hard, it helps block out all the little annoying things that are always around us. The psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi talks about this too. He points out that when you have super intense concentration, you don’t have any leftover attention to think about unimportant stuff or worry about problems. This is especially true in jobs that involve a lot of thinking and technology, where distractions are everywhere and can take away the meaning from what you’re doing.

To show this idea better, I’ll share my own experience. Think about the last five emails I sent before I started writing this chapter. Here’s what they were about:

- **Re: URGENT Brand Registration Confirmation.** This was about a scam where a company tried to trick website owners into registering their domain in China. I got annoyed with their constant spam and replied, telling them their scam would be better if they spelled “website” right.

- **Re: S R.** This was a chat with a family member about an article he found in the Wall Street Journal.

- **Re: Important Advice.** This email was about talking strategies for retirement investments.
