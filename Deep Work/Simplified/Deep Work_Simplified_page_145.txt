Herbert uses filters to help people and find cool opportunities. But these filters also make it easier for him to manage the messages he gets.

Another example is Antonio Centeno, who runs the Real Man Style blog. He has a special way for people to ask him questions. First, he tells them to post their questions in a public place instead of messaging him directly. He thinks it’s a waste of time to answer the same questions over and over in private. If you still want to ask him something, you have to agree to three promises by checking boxes:

1. I won’t ask Antonio a style question I could find on Google in 10 minutes.
2. I won’t spam Antonio with a random request to promote my business.
3. I’ll do a good deed for someone if Antonio replies within 23 hours.

You can only see the message box to type your question after you check all three promises.

In short, email technology is really powerful, but the way we use it needs to improve. It’s silly to think that all messages, no matter who they’re from or why they’re sent, should go to the same inbox and that we should respond to every single one quickly. Using sender filters is a small but helpful step toward fixing this problem. This idea is especially useful for entrepreneurs and freelancers who get a lot of messages and want to control their time better. I think it would be great if similar rules were used in big companies too, but we’re probably not there yet.

If you can, think about using sender filters to take back some control over your time and focus.

Tip #2: Do More Work When You Send or Reply to Emails

Here’s an example of a typical email: “It was great to meet you last week. I’d love to follow up on some of those...”
