Herbert uses filters to help people and find cool opportunities. But these filters also make it easier for him to manage the messages he gets.

Another example is Antonio Centeno, who runs the popular blog Real Man Style. He has a two-step process for messages. If you have a question, you have to post it in a public place instead of asking him directly. He thinks it’s a waste of time to answer the same questions over and over in private chats. If you get through this step, you have to agree to three promises by clicking checkboxes:

1. I won’t ask Antonio a style question I could find on Google in 10 minutes.
2. I won’t spam Antonio with a random request to promote my business.
3. I will do something nice for a stranger if Antonio replies within 23 hours.

You can’t even type your message until you check all three boxes.

In short, email technology is changing the game, but the way we use it is still pretty basic. It’s silly to think that all messages, no matter who sends them or why, should go to the same inbox and that every message needs a quick reply. The sender filter is a small but helpful step towards fixing this, especially for entrepreneurs and freelancers who get a lot of messages and want to control their time better. I’d also like to see similar rules used in big companies, but we’re probably not there yet.

If you can, think about using sender filters to take back some control over your time and focus.
