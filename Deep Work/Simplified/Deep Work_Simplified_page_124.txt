With the rise of the Internet and the way it grabs our attention, many people, especially those in my generation, are finding that their free time isn’t as good as it used to be. Instead of enjoying their leisure, they often just scroll through endless digital entertainment that doesn’t really enrich their lives. If someone like Bennett were alive today, he’d probably be really upset about how little we’ve improved in this area.

I don’t really care about the deeper meaning behind Bennett’s ideas. His thoughts on making the middle class better by reading poetry and classic books seem old-fashioned and a bit snobby. But the main point he made—that you should use your free time wisely—is still important today. This is especially true for reducing how much network tools distract you from doing focused work.

So far, we haven’t talked much about the types of online tools that really make it hard to focus: entertainment websites that are designed to keep your attention for as long as possible. Right now, popular sites like the Huffington Post, BuzzFeed, Business Insider, and Reddit are examples of this. These sites use catchy headlines and easy-to-read content, often created by algorithms, to grab your attention.

Once you click on one article, you’ll see links to more articles that tempt you to keep clicking. They use all sorts of tricks, like showing what’s “popular” or using eye-catching photos, to keep you interested. For example, some of the trending articles on BuzzFeed right now are “17 Words That Mean Something Totally Different When Spelled Backward” and “33 Dogs Winning at Everything.” 

These sites can be really distracting after work, taking over your free time. Whether you’re waiting in line, watching a slow TV show, or finishing a meal, they make sure you never feel bored. But as I mentioned before, this is a bad habit because it makes it harder for your brain to focus later when you actually need to concentrate. The worst part is that these tools are always there; you can’t just quit them like you would a social media account. They’re always just a click away.
