With the rise of the Internet and the kind of entertainment it offers, many people working full-time, especially my tech-savvy Millennial friends, find that their free time isn’t very good. Instead of enjoying their leisure time, they end up mindlessly clicking on simple online content. If someone like Bennett were alive today, he would probably be really upset about how little we’ve improved in this area.

I don’t really care about the deeper ideas behind Bennett’s suggestions. His idea of making the middle class better by reading poetry and classic books feels old-fashioned and a bit snobby. But the main point he made—that you should and can use your free time wisely—is still important today. This is especially true for the goal of this rule, which is to help you focus better and not let online distractions mess with your ability to do deep work.

So far, we haven’t talked much about a specific type of online tool that really gets in the way of focusing: entertainment websites that are designed to grab your attention and keep it for as long as possible. Right now, some of the most popular sites like Huffington Post, BuzzFeed, Business Insider, and Reddit are examples of this. These sites are always changing, but they all use catchy titles and easy-to-read content, often made to grab your attention quickly.

Once you click on one article from these sites, you’ll see links to more articles on the side or bottom of the page that tempt you to keep clicking. They use all sorts of tricks, like labeling articles as “popular” or “trending” and using eye-catching photos to keep you interested. For example, some of the trending articles on BuzzFeed right now are “17 Words That Mean Something Totally Different When Spelled Backward” and “33 Dogs Winning at Everything.”

These sites can be especially harmful after work because they can take over your free time. When you’re waiting in line, for a show to get interesting, or while eating, they give you something to do so you don’t get bored. But as I mentioned in Rule #2, this is risky because it makes it harder for your brain to resist distractions, which makes focusing on important work later much tougher. To make it worse, these online tools are always there; they’re not something you join, so you can’t just quit them to get them out of your life. They’re always just a click away.
