Chapter Two  
Deep Work Is Rare  

In 2012, Facebook showed off plans for a new headquarters created by Frank Gehry. At the heart of this building is what CEO Mark Zuckerberg called “the largest open floor plan in the world.” Over three thousand employees will work with movable furniture spread out over ten acres. Facebook isn’t the only big tech company that likes open offices. When Jack Dorsey, who we met at the end of the last chapter, bought the old San Francisco Chronicle building for Square, he set it up so his developers work together on long shared desks. Dorsey said, “We encourage people to stay out in the open because we believe in serendipity—and people walking by each other teaching new things.”  

Another big trend in business lately is instant messaging. An article from the Times says this tech is no longer just for chatty teens; it’s now helping companies get more done and respond to customers faster. A senior product manager at IBM said, “We send 2.5 million I.M.’s within I.B.M. each day.”  

One of the successful new companies in the business IM world is Hall, a Silicon Valley start-up that helps employees work together in real-time. A developer I know in San Francisco told me what it’s like to work at a company that uses Hall. The most “efficient” employees set up their text editor to flash an alert when a new question or comment is posted on Hall. They can quickly switch to Hall, type their thoughts, and then jump back to coding without missing a beat. My friend was really impressed by how fast they were.  

A third trend is that content creators of all kinds are now encouraged to have a social media presence. The New York Times, which is known for its old-school media values, now tells its employees to tweet. This advice has been taken seriously by over eight hundred writers, editors, and photographers at the paper who now have Twitter accounts.
