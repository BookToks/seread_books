Chapter Two  
Deep Work Is Rare  

In 2012, Facebook showed off plans for a new headquarters designed by Frank Gehry. At the center of this building is what CEO Mark Zuckerberg called “the largest open floor plan in the world.” More than three thousand employees will work on movable furniture spread over ten acres. Facebook isn’t the only big tech company to go for this open office style. When Jack Dorsey, who we met at the end of the last chapter, bought the old San Francisco Chronicle building for Square, he set it up so his developers work in shared spaces on long desks. “We want people to stay out in the open because we believe in chance meetings and people teaching each other new things,” Dorsey said.  

Another big trend in business lately is the rise of instant messaging. An article from the Times says this tech is no longer just for chatty teens and is now helping companies get better at “productivity and customer response time.” A senior product manager at IBM proudly said, “We send 2.5 million instant messages within IBM every day.”  

One of the newer successful companies in business instant messaging is Hall, a Silicon Valley start-up that helps employees chat and work together in real-time. A developer from San Francisco told me what it’s like to work at a company that uses Hall. The most “efficient” employees, he said, set up their text editor to show an alert on their screen when a new question or comment pops up in Hall. They can quickly switch to Hall, type their thoughts, and then jump back to their coding without missing a beat. My friend seemed really impressed by how fast they could do this.  

A third trend is that content creators of all kinds are being encouraged to have a social media presence. The New York Times, which is known for its traditional media values, now tells its employees to tweet. This advice has been taken seriously by the more than eight hundred writers, editors, and photographers at the paper who now have Twitter accounts.
