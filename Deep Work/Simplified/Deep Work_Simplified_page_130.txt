Think about how meetings, calls, and other scheduled events can take up a lot of your time. For many jobs, these things can leave you with hardly any time for your own work.

As a professor, I usually have fewer of these commitments, but they still take up a big part of my day, especially during the school year. For example, on a random day last semester, I had a meeting from eleven to twelve, another meeting from one to two thirty, and then I had a class from three to five. So, out of my eight-hour workday, I only had four hours left. Even if I crammed all my smaller tasks like emails into just half an hour, I still wouldn’t reach my goal of four hours of focused work. This shows that even though we can’t spend the whole day deeply focused, we should still try to cut down on the smaller tasks, since a typical workday can get broken up more easily than we think.

In short, be careful with shallow work because it can mess up your productivity more than you realize. While some of this work is unavoidable, you need to keep it under control so it doesn’t stop you from doing the deeper work that really matters. The tips that follow will help you manage this better.

Plan Out Your Day
If you’re between 25 and 34 years old and live in Britain, you probably watch more TV than you think. In 2013, a survey asked people about their TV habits. Those aged 25 to 34 guessed they watched about 15 to 16 hours a week. That sounds like a lot, but it’s actually way less than the truth. The Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board, which tracks TV watching in Britain, found that these viewers actually watch around 28 hours a week.

This problem of underestimating time isn’t just about British TV. When different groups try to guess how much time they spend on various activities, they often get it wrong too.
