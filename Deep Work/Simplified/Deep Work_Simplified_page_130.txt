Think about how meetings, calls, and other scheduled events can take up a lot of your time. For many jobs, these things can leave you with hardly any time for your own work.

As a professor, I usually have fewer of these commitments, but they still take up a big part of my day, especially during the school year. For example, on a random day from last semester, I had a meeting from eleven to twelve, another one from one to two-thirty, and then I had to teach a class from three to five. So, out of my eight-hour workday, I already lost four hours. Even if I crammed all my quick tasks, like emails, into just thirty minutes, I would still be short of my goal of four hours of focused work. In other words, even though we can’t spend all day deeply focused, it’s still super important to cut down on the shallow work because a typical workday can get broken up more easily than we think.

To sum it up, be careful with shallow work because it can hurt you more than you realize, while people often think it’s more important than it really is. This kind of work is unavoidable, but you need to keep it under control so it doesn’t stop you from doing the deeper work that really matters. The tips that follow will help you deal with this.

Plan Every Minute of Your Day

If you’re between twenty-five and thirty-four years old and live in Britain, you probably watch more TV than you think. In 2013, a survey asked people about their TV habits. The twenty-five-to-thirty-four-year-olds said they watched about fifteen to sixteen hours a week. That sounds like a lot, but it’s actually way less than the truth. We know this because there’s a system that tracks how much people really watch. The Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board, which is like the Nielsen Company in America, puts meters in some homes to see exactly how much TV people watch. It turns out that those who thought they watched fifteen hours a week actually watch around twenty-eight hours.

This problem of underestimating time isn’t just about British TV. When different groups try to guess how much time they spend on various activities, they often get it wrong in a similar way.
