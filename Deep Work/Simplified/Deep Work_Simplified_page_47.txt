This idea changes how most people see their life experiences. We usually think that our situation, like what happens to us, decides how we feel. So, we believe that big things, like getting a promotion or moving to a better apartment, are what really matter. But Gallagher says research shows this isn’t true. Our brains actually shape how we see the world based on what we pay attention to. If you focus on something bad, like a cancer diagnosis, your life feels dark and unhappy. But if you think about something nice, like enjoying a drink with friends, your life feels better, even if the situation is the same. Gallagher puts it simply: “Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love—is the sum of what you focus on.”

In her book *Rapt*, Gallagher talks about research that backs up this idea. She mentions Barbara Fredrickson, a psychologist from the University of North Carolina who studies emotions. Fredrickson found that after something bad happens, what you choose to focus on can really change your attitude. These choices can act like a “reset button” for your feelings. For example, if a couple is arguing about chores, instead of just thinking about how selfish one partner is, they could focus on the fact that they talked about the problem, which is a step toward fixing it and feeling better. This might seem like just a way to think positively, but Fredrickson discovered that using these emotional “leverage points” can lead to much better feelings after tough times.

Scientists can even see this effect in the brain. Laura Carstensen, a psychologist from Stanford, used an fMRI scanner to look at how people’s brains react to both good and bad images. She found that young people’s brains reacted strongly to both types of images. But when she looked at older people, their brains only reacted to the positive images. Carstensen thinks that older people have trained their brains to ignore negative things and focus on the positive. They aren’t happier just because their lives are better; they’re happier because they’ve learned to enjoy the good stuff and not let the bad stuff get to them. By managing their attention well, they make their lives better.
