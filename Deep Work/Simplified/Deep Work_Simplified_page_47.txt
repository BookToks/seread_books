experience.

This idea changes how most people think about their feelings in life. We often believe that our situation, like what happens to us or what doesn’t happen, decides how we feel. From this view, the little things we do every day don’t seem that important because we think only big events matter, like getting a job promotion or moving to a nicer place. But Gallagher says that research shows this isn’t true. Our brains actually shape how we see the world based on what we pay attention to. If you focus on something negative, like a cancer diagnosis, your life feels sad and heavy. But if you focus on something nice, like enjoying a martini in the evening, your life feels better, even if the situation is the same. Gallagher sums it up by saying, “Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love—is the sum of what you focus on.”

In her book, *Rapt*, Gallagher looks at research that backs up this idea about how our minds work. She mentions Barbara Fredrickson, a psychologist from the University of North Carolina who studies emotions. Fredrickson’s research shows that after something bad happens, what you choose to focus on can really change your attitude moving forward. These simple choices can act like a “reset button” for your feelings. For example, if a couple is arguing about chores, instead of just thinking about how lazy your partner is, Fredrickson suggests focusing on the fact that they talked about the problem, which is a step toward fixing it and feeling better. This might sound like just a way to think positively, but Fredrickson found that using these emotional “leverage points” can lead to much better outcomes after bad events.

Scientists can even see this effect happening in the brain. For instance, Stanford psychologist Laura Carstensen used an fMRI scanner to study how people react to both good and bad images. She found that young people’s brains reacted strongly to both types of images. But when she looked at older people, their brains only reacted to the positive images. Carstensen thinks that older people have trained their brains to ignore the negative stuff. They aren’t happier just because their lives are better; they’re happier because they’ve learned to focus on the good things instead of the bad. By managing their attention well, they’ve made their world a better place.
