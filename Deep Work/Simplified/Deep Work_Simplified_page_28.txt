Dorsey has a packed schedule because he runs both Twitter and Square. This keeps him from having long stretches of quiet time to think. He often ends his day with a bunch of meeting notes that he has to sort through at night. He believes in being available to others, so he works at stand-up tables where anyone can come and talk to him.
