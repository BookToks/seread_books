They built a new lab that was designed to help scientists and engineers work together more easily. Kelly didn’t like the usual setup where different departments were in separate buildings. Instead, he made one big building connected by long hallways—some so long that if you stood at one end, it looked like it disappeared into the distance. Jon Gertner, who writes about Bell Labs, said that walking down those halls without running into friends or ideas was almost impossible. A physicist going to lunch was like a magnet attracting metal pieces.

This plan, along with Kelly’s effort to bring in some of the smartest people in the world, led to amazing inventions. After World War II, the lab created many important things like the first solar cell, laser, communication satellite, cellular phone system, and fiber optic networking. Their researchers also developed information theory and coding theory. Their astronomers even won a Nobel Prize for proving the Big Bang Theory, and most importantly, their physicists invented the transistor.

The idea that creativity happens by chance seems to be true based on history. The transistor likely needed Bell Labs and its mix of solid-state physicists, quantum theorists, and top experimental scientists all in one place so they could meet and share ideas. This kind of invention probably wouldn’t happen from just one scientist working alone in a quiet place.

But we need to look deeper to understand what really sparked innovation at places like Building 20 and Bell Labs. Let’s think about my own time at MIT. When I started as a new PhD student in 2004, I was in the first group to use the new Stata Center, which replaced Building 20. Since it was new, we got tours that showed off its cool features. Frank Gehry designed the offices around shared spaces and added open staircases to encourage those chance meetings that were so important in the old building. 

However, what really caught my attention was something that Gehry hadn’t planned but was added later because the faculty insisted: special soundproofing gaskets for the office doors. The professors at MIT, who are some of the most innovative tech experts, didn’t want an open-office setup. They wanted the option to close their doors.
