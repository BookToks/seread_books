the door and work in peace. 

The new lab was designed to help scientists and engineers work together better. Instead of putting different departments in separate buildings like most universities, they made one big building connected by long hallways. These hallways were so long that if you stood at one end, it looked like they disappeared into the distance. Jon Gertner, who writes about Bell Labs, said it was hard to walk down the hall without running into friends, problems, or new ideas. A physicist going to lunch was like a magnet attracting metal shavings.

This plan, along with Kelly’s push to hire some of the smartest people, led to amazing inventions after World War II. The lab created the first solar cell, laser, communication satellite, cellular system, and fiber optic networking. Their theorists came up with information theory and coding theory, and their astronomers even won a Nobel Prize for proving the Big Bang Theory. Most importantly, they invented the transistor.

The idea that creativity happens by chance seems to be true based on history. The invention of the transistor likely needed the collaboration at Bell Labs, where physicists, theorists, and experimentalists could meet and share ideas. This kind of invention probably wouldn’t happen with just one scientist working alone in a quiet place.

But we need to look deeper to understand what really sparked innovation in places like Building 20 and Bell Labs. When I started my PhD at MIT in 2004, I was in the new Stata Center, which replaced Building 20. We got tours that showed off its features. The architect, Frank Gehry, designed the offices around common areas and added open staircases to encourage spontaneous meetings, just like in the old building. However, one feature that surprised me was the soundproofing added to the office doors because the professors didn’t want an open-office setup. They preferred to close their doors and work quietly.
