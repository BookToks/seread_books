Taking breaks in the evening can help your brain relax, just like walking in nature does. But if you keep checking your emails or working on tasks after dinner, you’re not giving your brain the break it needs. Even short work sessions can stop you from fully relaxing, which is important for recharging your focus. You need to feel like your work is done for the day so your brain can start to unwind and get ready for tomorrow. Trying to squeeze in more work at night might actually make you less productive the next day.

Another reason to stop working at a set time is that the work you do in the evening usually isn’t that important. Anders Ericsson, who came up with the idea of deliberate practice, studied how people get better at skills. He found that for beginners, about an hour of focused work is the most they can handle in a day. For experts, it can be up to four hours, but not much more than that.

In one study, elite violin players at a top music school practiced for about three and a half hours each day, usually split into two sessions. Less skilled players practiced less. This shows that there’s a limit to how much deep work you can do in a day. If you plan your time well, you can make the most of your daily deep work.
