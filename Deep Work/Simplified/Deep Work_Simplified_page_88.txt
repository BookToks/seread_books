Taking breaks in the evening is just as important as going for a walk in nature. 

If you keep checking your emails or working on tasks after dinner, you’re not giving your brain the break it needs. Even if you only spend a little time on work, it stops you from relaxing enough to recharge. You need to feel like you’re done with work for the day so your brain can start to relax and get ready for tomorrow. Trying to do more work in the evening might actually make you less productive the next day. 

Now, let’s talk about why it’s important to have a clear end to your workday. Anders Ericsson, who came up with the idea of deliberate practice, says that this practice is what helps you get better at something. Deep work and deliberate practice are pretty similar. 

In a paper from 1993, Ericsson talks about how much focused work people can handle. He found that beginners can only concentrate intensely for about an hour a day, while experts can do it for up to four hours, but not much more than that. 

One study looked at elite violin players in Berlin and found that they practiced intensely for about three and a half hours each day, usually split into two sessions. Less skilled players practiced for less time. 

This shows that there’s a limit to how much deep work you can do in a day. If you plan your time well, you can make the most of your deep work hours.
