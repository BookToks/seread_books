Let’s start with the first skill. First, we need to remember that we’re used to easy-to-use technology, like Twitter and the iPhone. But these are just consumer products, not serious tools. The smart machines that are changing everything are much harder to understand and use.

Take Nate Silver, for example. He’s great at using complicated technology. But making accurate predictions about elections isn’t as simple as typing “Who will win more votes?” into a search box. He has a huge database of poll results from many different sources that he analyzes using a program called Stata. This program is not easy to use. For instance, here’s a command you need to know to work with a database like Nate’s: 

CREATE VIEW cities AS SELECT name, population, altitude FROM capitals UNION SELECT name, population, altitude FROM non_capitals;

Databases like this use a language called SQL. You give them commands like this to get the information you need. Learning how to work with these databases is tricky. The command above creates a “view,” which is like a virtual table that combines data from different tables. Knowing when and how to create these views is a tough skill to master if you want to get good results from real-world databases.

Staying with Nate Silver, let’s look at the other tool he uses: Stata. This software is powerful and definitely not something you can learn just by playing around with it. The latest version has many new features, like treatment effects and forecasting. Nate uses this complex software to build detailed models with many parts, which are then used to make predictions.

The main point here is that smart machines are complicated and hard to master. To be someone who can work well with these machines, you need to practice and get good at mastering difficult things.
