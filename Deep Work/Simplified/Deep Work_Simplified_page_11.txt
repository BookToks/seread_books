Your situation is like Jung trying to outsmart Freud or Jason Benn trying to keep up in a fast-paced start-up. To succeed, you need to create the best work you can, which takes a lot of focus. 

The need for deep work is something new. In the past, there were only a few skilled jobs where deep work mattered, but most people could do their jobs without needing to concentrate hard. They were just paid to make things, and their work didn’t change much over the years. But now, as we move into an information economy, more people are working with knowledge, and deep work is becoming really important—even if many don’t see it yet. 

Deep work isn’t an old skill that’s losing its value. It’s actually a key ability for anyone who wants to get ahead in a competitive job market that can easily replace those who aren’t pulling their weight. The big rewards go to those who can create complex systems, not just those who can scroll through social media. Deep work is so important that some people call it “the superpower of the 21st century.”

We’ve talked about two ideas: one is that deep work is becoming rare, and the other is that it’s becoming more valuable. Together, they form the Deep Work Hypothesis: the ability to do deep work is getting harder to find just when it’s becoming more valuable. Because of this, those who develop this skill and make it a big part of their work life will do really well.

This book has two main goals. The first part will show you that the deep work hypothesis is true. The second part will teach you how to use this idea by training your brain and changing your work habits to focus on deep work. Before we get into that, I want to share how I became so passionate about deep work.

For the last ten years, I’ve been working on my ability to concentrate on tough tasks. To understand why this matters to me, it helps to know that I’m a theoretical computer scientist who trained at MIT, where focusing is super important.
