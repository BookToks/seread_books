Your situation is like Jung trying to outsmart Freud or Jason Benn trying to keep up in a fast-paced start-up. To succeed, you need to create the best work you can, which takes a lot of focus.

Deep work is becoming more important now. In the past, only a few skilled workers needed to focus deeply, while most jobs didn’t require much concentration. People were just paid to do simple tasks, and their jobs didn’t change much over time. But now, as we move into an information economy, more people are knowledge workers, and deep work is becoming really important, even if many don’t see it yet.

Deep work isn’t an old skill that’s fading away. It’s actually a key ability for anyone who wants to succeed in a competitive job market. The best rewards go to those who can create new systems and ideas, not just those who can scroll through social media. Deep work is so crucial that some people call it the “superpower of the 21st century.”

We’ve talked about how deep work is getting rarer and more valuable. This leads us to the main idea of the book: The Deep Work Hypothesis. It says that being able to do deep work is becoming less common at the same time it’s becoming more valuable. Because of this, those who develop this skill and make it a big part of their work life will do really well.

This book has two main goals. The first part will show you that the deep work hypothesis is true. The second part will teach you how to take advantage of this by training your brain and changing your work habits to focus on deep work. Before we get into that, I want to share how I became so passionate about deep work.

For the last ten years, I’ve been working on my ability to concentrate on tough tasks. To understand why this matters to me, it helps to know that I’m a theoretical computer scientist who trained at MIT, where focusing deeply is super important.
