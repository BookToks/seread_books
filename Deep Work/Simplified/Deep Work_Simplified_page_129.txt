37signals’ experiments show something important: the easy tasks that take up a lot of time for people who work with knowledge aren't as crucial as they seem. For most businesses, if you cut down on these easy tasks, it probably won't hurt their profits. Jason Fried found that if you not only get rid of shallow work but also use that time for more meaningful work, the business can keep running and even do better.

This idea encourages you to think about your own work life. The strategies that follow will help you spot the easy tasks in your schedule and reduce them, giving you more time for the important work that really matters.

Before we get into the strategies, we need to recognize that there’s a limit to how much you can cut back on shallow work. Deep work is way more valuable than shallow work, but that doesn’t mean you should try to fill every minute with deep tasks. Some shallow work is necessary for most jobs. You might not need to check your email every ten minutes, but ignoring important messages completely won’t work out well for you.

Another thing to consider is how much mental energy you have. Deep work can be tiring because it pushes you to your limits. Performance psychologists have studied how long people can keep this up in a day. For someone just starting to practice a new skill, about an hour a day is a good limit. If you’re more experienced, you might manage around four hours, but not much more.

This means that once you hit your limit for deep work in a day, trying to do more won’t be very helpful. Shallow work only becomes a problem when you do enough of it to take away from your deep work time. At first, this might sound good. A typical workday is eight hours, and the best deep thinkers can only spend about four hours really focused. So, you can spend half the day on shallow tasks without it being a big deal. The problem is that it’s easy to fill that time up quickly.
