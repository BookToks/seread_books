37signals’ experiments show something important: a lot of the work we do that feels urgent and busy isn’t as important as it seems. For most companies, if they cut down on this less important work, their profits would probably stay the same. Jason Fried found that if you not only cut out the shallow work but also use that time for more meaningful tasks, the business can actually do better.

This idea is asking you to think about your own work life. The strategies that follow will help you spot the unimportant stuff in your schedule and cut it down to make more time for the things that really matter.

Before we get into those strategies, we should talk about the fact that there’s a limit to how much we can avoid shallow work. Deep work is way more valuable than shallow work, but that doesn’t mean you should try to fill every minute of your day with deep tasks. Some shallow work is necessary to keep most jobs running smoothly. You might not need to check your email every ten minutes, but you can’t ignore important messages forever. So, the goal here is to reduce the amount of shallow work in your schedule, not get rid of it completely.

Another thing to consider is how much mental energy we have. Deep work can be tiring because it pushes you to your limits. Performance psychologists have studied how long people can keep up this kind of work in a day. They found that for someone just starting to learn a skill, about an hour a day is a good limit. For those who are more experienced, it can go up to four hours, but not much more.

This means that once you reach your limit for deep work in a day, trying to do more won’t give you the same benefits. Shallow work only becomes a problem when it starts to take over the time you have for deep work. At first, this might sound good. A typical workday is eight hours, and the best deep thinkers can only focus deeply for about four hours. So, you can spend half the day on shallow tasks without it being a big deal. The problem is how quickly that time can add up, especially once you...
