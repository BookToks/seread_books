Inventor Jorge Hirsch created a way to measure how much impact someone has in their field using something called the h-index. In computer science, getting an h-index score over 40 is really hard, and if you do, it shows you have a strong career. But if your score is low when you go for a job review, you might be in trouble. Google Scholar, a tool that helps find research papers, automatically calculates your h-index, so you can see how you’re doing regularly. (By the way, as I write this, my score is 21.)

This makes it easier for professors to decide how to spend their time. For example, the famous physicist Richard Feynman talked about his unique way of staying productive in an interview. He said to do great physics work, you need a lot of time and focus. He believed that if you have to manage anything, you won’t have that time. So, he pretended to be irresponsible. He would say no to things like joining committees because he wanted to focus on what mattered most: doing good physics work. Feynman probably wasn’t great at answering emails and wouldn’t want to change offices or be told to tweet. Knowing what’s important helps you see what’s not.

I mention professors because they are a bit different from most workers, who often don’t have a clear idea of how well they’re doing. Matthew Crawford, a social critic, talks about how managers feel confused and anxious about their unclear tasks. He specifically described middle managers, but this confusion can apply to many jobs. In his book, *Shop Class as Soulcraft*, Crawford quit his job at a think tank to open a motorcycle repair shop. He wanted to escape that confusion. Fixing a broken bike and seeing it work again gave him a clear sense of success.
