semester. 

I learned a lesson that I keep learning in my career. I've been focused on deep work for over ten years, but I still get surprised by how powerful it is. Back in grad school, when I first started to really focus on this skill, deep work helped me write two quality research papers each year, which was pretty good for a student. I managed to do this without working late on weekdays or at all on weekends, which was rare for my classmates.

As I got closer to becoming a professor, I started to worry. As a student and postdoc, I had a lot of free time, but I knew that would change soon. I wasn’t sure if I could fit enough deep work into my new, busier schedule to keep being productive. Instead of just stressing out, I decided to take action: I made a plan to strengthen my deep work skills. 

During my last two years at MIT, while I was a postdoc looking for professor jobs, I worked on this plan. My main idea was to create limits in my schedule to mimic the less free time I expected as a professor. I set a rule not to work at night and started taking long lunch breaks to run and eat at home. I also agreed to write my fourth book, "So Good They Can’t Ignore You," which added more demands on my time.

To deal with these new limits, I improved my ability to work deeply. I started blocking out specific hours for deep work and made sure nothing interrupted them. I also learned to think through ideas while walking, which helped my productivity. In the summer, I often worked under the dome in the Barker Engineering library, which was a great spot but too crowded during the school year. In winter, I found quieter places, like the small but nice Lewis Music Library. I even bought a $50 fancy notebook to work on math proofs, thinking that spending money on it would make me more careful with my work.

I was surprised by how well this focus on deep work worked out for me. After I got a job as a computer science professor at Georgetown University, I realized my efforts had really paid off.
