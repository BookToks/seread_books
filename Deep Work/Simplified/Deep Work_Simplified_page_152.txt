semester. 

I’ve learned a big lesson in my career over and over again. For more than ten years, I’ve focused on doing deep work, and I still get surprised by how effective it is. Back in grad school, when I first started using this skill, I found that deep work helped me write two good research papers each year, which was pretty impressive for a student. I usually finished my work by five on weekdays and didn’t have to work on weekends, which was rare for my classmates.

But as I got closer to becoming a professor, I started to worry. As a student and postdoc, I had a lot of free time, but I knew that would change when I became a professor. I wasn’t sure I could fit in enough deep work into my busier schedule to keep being productive. Instead of just worrying, I decided to make a plan to improve my deep work skills. 

During my last two years at MIT, while looking for professor jobs, I set up some rules to help me practice deep work. I made sure not to work at night and took long lunch breaks to run and eat at home. I also signed a contract to write my fourth book, which added more pressure on my time. 

To handle these new limits, I got better at deep work. I started blocking out specific hours for deep work and made sure nothing interrupted them. I also learned to think through ideas while walking, which helped me be more productive. In the summer, I liked working in the big Barker Engineering library, but it got too crowded when school started. In winter, I found quieter spots, like the small but nice Lewis Music Library. I even bought a $50 fancy notebook for math proofs, thinking it would make me focus more.

I was surprised by how well my focus on deep work paid off. After I got a job as a computer science professor at Georgetown University, I realized my efforts were really working.
