When you don’t feel like you have to respond to every message, it changes how you see your inbox. Instead of feeling stressed by a bunch of unread messages, it becomes a place where you can look for opportunities when you have time. You can choose to ignore messages without feeling guilty, and that can feel really freeing.

At first, I was worried that using a filter for my messages would make me seem stuck-up, like my time was more important than other people’s. I thought it might upset some readers. But that didn’t happen. Most people understand that you have the right to control your own messages, just like they want to do the same. Plus, people like it when things are clear. Most don’t expect a reply from you, especially if they don’t think you owe them one. Many people, like authors, often think others care more about their replies than they actually do.

Sometimes, when you change what people expect, it can actually make them appreciate you more when you do respond. For example, an editor once reached out to me for a guest post, thinking I probably wouldn’t reply because of my filter. When I did respond, it surprised her in a good way. She said, “When I emailed Cal to see if he wanted to write for us, I didn’t expect much. He didn’t have anything saying he wanted to guest blog, so I wouldn’t have been upset if I never heard back. But when he did reply, I was really happy!”

My message filter is just one way to handle this. There’s also a consultant named Clay Herbert who helps tech start-ups with crowdfunding. He got so many messages asking for advice that he created filters to manage them. To reach him, you first have to check an FAQ to see if your question is already answered. If you still want to ask, you fill out a survey that helps him see if your question is relevant to what he does. If you get past that, there’s a small fee to talk to him. This fee isn’t about making money; it’s about making sure that the people who reach out are serious about getting and using his advice.
