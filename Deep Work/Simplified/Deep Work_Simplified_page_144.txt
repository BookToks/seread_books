When you stop feeling like you have to respond to every message, your inbox becomes a place where you can find opportunities when you have time. You can look through the messages and choose which ones you want to reply to. The pile of unread messages doesn’t make you feel stressed anymore. You can ignore them if you want, and it’s totally fine. This can feel really freeing.

At first, I was worried that using a sender filter would make me seem like I thought my time was more important than others'. I thought it might upset people. But that didn’t happen. Most people understand that you have the right to control your messages, just like they want to control theirs. Plus, people like knowing what to expect. Most are fine with not getting a reply if they didn’t expect one in the first place. A lot of authors think people care more about their replies than they actually do.

Sometimes, changing these expectations can even make people appreciate you more when you do respond. For example, an editor once sent me a chance to write for her website, thinking I probably wouldn’t reply because of my filter. When I did respond, she was really happy. She said that since I hadn’t indicated I wanted to guest blog, she wasn’t upset if I didn’t reply. So, when I did, it was a nice surprise for her.

My sender filter is just one way to manage communication. There’s also Clay Herbert, who helps tech start-ups with crowdfunding. He got so many messages that he made filters to help manage them. To contact him, you first have to check an FAQ to see if your question is already answered. If you still have a question, you fill out a survey to see if your issue is relevant to him. If you get through that, there’s a small fee to talk to him. This fee isn’t about making money; it’s to make sure that people are serious about getting advice.
