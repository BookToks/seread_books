Fixed-schedule productivity means you should ignore work messages until the next morning. Some people think this could cause problems since quick replies are expected. But just because your boss is checking emails at night doesn’t mean she wants you to respond right away. This strategy will help you learn that.

Fixed-schedule productivity is a simple habit to pick up, but it can really change how you work. If you can only focus on one thing to help you concentrate better, this should be at the top of your list. If you’re still unsure about how setting limits on your work hours can help you succeed, look at Radhika Nagpal’s career. While Tom was complaining online about his heavy workload as a young professor, Nagpal was celebrating her success. Her research was even on the cover of the journal Science.

Now, let’s talk about email. It’s a big distraction for many people at work because it constantly pulls your attention. We’re so used to checking emails that we forget we can control how much they affect us.

I’ll share three tips to help you manage how email affects your time and focus, so you don’t lose your independence. You actually have more control over your emails than you might think.
