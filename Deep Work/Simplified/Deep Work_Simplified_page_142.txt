If you follow a fixed schedule for work, you might ignore emails until the next morning. Some people think this could cause issues since quick replies are often expected. But just because your boss is checking emails at night doesn’t mean she wants an answer right away. This strategy will help you learn that.

Fixed-schedule productivity is a simple habit to start, but it can really change how you work. If you want to focus more on important tasks, this should be one of your top choices. If you’re still unsure about how setting limits on your work hours can help you succeed, look at Radhika Nagpal’s career.

When we talk about shallow work, we can’t forget about email. Email is a big distraction for many people because it constantly pulls your attention. We’ve gotten so used to checking emails that we forget we can control how much it affects our lives.
