Chappell started by trying to commit to doing deep work, which means focusing really hard on tasks. He made a rule that he would work in ninety-minute blocks because it takes time to really concentrate. He planned to fit these blocks into his schedule whenever he could. But this plan didn’t help him get much done. The year before, during a dissertation boot camp, he had written a whole chapter in just one week of focused work. After he got a full-time job, he only managed to write one more chapter in his entire first year.

The slow progress made him switch to a new method called the rhythmic approach. He decided to wake up at five-thirty every morning to work. He would work until seven-thirty, then make breakfast and go to work, already done with his dissertation for the day. Happy with his early progress, he soon started waking up even earlier at four-forty-five to get more done in the morning.

When I talked to Chappell for this book, he said his rhythmic way of scheduling deep work was “super productive and guilt-free.” He was writing four to five pages a day and could finish a chapter every two or three weeks, which is impressive for someone with a nine-to-five job. He thought, “Why can’t I be that productive? Why not me?”

The rhythmic method is different from another method called bimodal. It might not reach the highest levels of deep thinking that the bimodal method aims for, which involves long hours of concentration. But the rhythmic approach fits better with how people actually work. By sticking to solid routines that ensure some work gets done regularly, someone using the rhythmic method often ends up with more total hours of deep work in a year.

Choosing between rhythmic and bimodal depends on how well you can control your schedule. If you’re someone like Carl Jung, who is in a serious debate with Sigmund Freud’s followers, you’ll find it easy to make time to focus on your ideas. But if you’re writing a dissertation without anyone pushing you to finish, the regular habits of the rhythmic method might be what you need to keep making progress.

For many people, it’s not just about self-control that leads them to prefer the rhythmic method. Some jobs don’t let you just disappear to focus on work.
