Chappell started by trying to commit to deep work, which means focusing hard on tasks. He made a rule to work in ninety-minute blocks because it takes time to really concentrate. He thought he could fit these blocks into his schedule whenever he had time. But this plan didn’t really help him get much done. 

Last year, during a dissertation boot camp, he wrote a whole chapter in just one week of focused work. But after he got a full-time job, he only managed to write one more chapter in his entire first year. The slow progress made him switch to a new method called the rhythmic approach. He decided to wake up at five-thirty every morning to work. He would write until seven-thirty, then make breakfast and head to work, already done with his dissertation for the day. Happy with his early progress, he even started waking up at four-forty-five to get more work done in the morning.

When I talked to Chappell for this book, he said his rhythmic way of scheduling deep work was “super productive and guilt-free.” He was writing four to five pages of academic work every day and could finish a chapter every two or three weeks, which is amazing for someone with a nine-to-five job. He asked, “Why can’t I be that productive? Why not me?”

The rhythmic method is different from another method called bimodal. While bimodal aims for super intense focus during long sessions, rhythmic works better with how people actually are. By sticking to solid routines, rhythmic schedulers often get more deep work hours in a year. 

Choosing between rhythmic and bimodal depends on how well you can control your schedule. If you’re someone like Carl Jung, fighting for your ideas, you’ll find time to focus. But if you’re writing a dissertation without any pressure, the regular habits of the rhythmic method might help you keep making progress. For many people, it’s not just about self-control; some jobs don’t let you just disappear to work.
