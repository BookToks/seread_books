In the fall of 2011, my responsibilities really increased. But I had been getting ready for this. Not only did I keep up my research, but I actually got better at it.

As a graduate student, I usually wrote two good papers a year. But after I became a busy professor, that number jumped to four good papers a year on average. I was impressed by this, but I soon realized I could do even more with deep work. I learned this lesson in my third year as a professor. From fall 2013 to summer 2014, I focused on improving my deep work habits again. A big reason for this was the book you’re reading now—most of it was written during this time. Writing a big book added a lot of pressure to my already full schedule, and I wanted to make sure my academic work didn’t suffer.

Another reason I got back to deep work was the upcoming tenure process. I had a year or two left to publish before I submitted my tenure case. This was my chance to show what I could do, especially since my wife and I were planning to have a second child right before my tenure year. The last reason I focused on deep work was more personal. I had applied for a grant that many of my colleagues got, but I didn’t. I felt upset and embarrassed, so instead of just complaining, I decided to prove myself by publishing even more impressive work. I wanted my publications to show that I knew what I was doing, even if that one grant didn’t work out.

I was already good at deep work, but these three reasons pushed me to take it to the next level. I started saying no to time-consuming commitments and worked in quiet places outside my office. I kept track of my deep work hours where I could see them and got frustrated if they didn’t grow fast enough. I also went back to my old habit from MIT of thinking about problems whenever I had a chance—like when I was walking the dog or commuting. Instead of waiting for a deadline to get serious, I worked hard almost every day, tackling important problems no matter what. I figured out solutions on subway rides and while shoveling snow. When my son napped on weekends, I walked around the yard thinking, and when I was stuck in traffic, I worked through problems in my head.
