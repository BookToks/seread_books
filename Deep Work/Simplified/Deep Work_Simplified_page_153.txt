In the fall of 2011, my responsibilities really increased. But I had been getting ready for this moment. Not only did I keep up my research, but I actually got better at it. 

When I was a graduate student, I wrote about two good papers a year. Once I became a busy professor, that number jumped to four good papers a year on average. I thought that was pretty impressive, but I soon realized I could do even more with deep work. I learned this during my third year as a professor. From fall 2013 to summer 2014 at Georgetown, I focused on improving my deep work habits. A big reason for this was the book you’re reading now, which I mostly wrote during that time. Writing a big book added a lot of pressure to my already full schedule, and I wanted to make sure my academic work didn’t suffer. 

Another reason I got back into deep work was because of the upcoming tenure process. I had a year or two left to publish before I submitted my tenure case. This was my chance to show what I could do, especially since my wife and I were planning to have a second child right before my tenure decision. The last reason I pushed myself was more personal. I had applied for a well-known grant but got rejected, while many of my colleagues got it. I felt upset and embarrassed, so instead of just complaining, I decided to work harder and publish more impressive papers to prove I knew what I was doing, even if I didn’t get that grant.

I was already good at deep work, but these three reasons pushed me to take it to the next level. I started saying no to time-consuming commitments and worked in quiet places outside my office. I kept track of my deep work hours near my desk and got frustrated when they didn’t grow fast enough. I also went back to my old habit from MIT of thinking about problems whenever I had a moment, like when I was walking my dog or commuting. Instead of only working hard as deadlines approached, I was pushing myself almost every day to tackle important problems, no matter if a deadline was near. I solved math problems on the subway and while shoveling snow. When my son napped on weekends, I walked around the yard thinking, and when I was stuck in traffic, I worked through problems in my head.
