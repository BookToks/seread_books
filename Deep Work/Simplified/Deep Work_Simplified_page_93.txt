Adam Marlin was really smart when he started working—he has three degrees from Ivy League schools. But he met some people who only went to small religious schools, and they could outsmart him easily. He realized that these people became successful not because of fancy schools, but because they studied hard every day since they were in fifth grade.

After some time, Marlin noticed that he was getting better at thinking deeply. He said, “I’ve been coming up with more creative ideas for my business.” He believes this is because of his daily mental practice. He didn’t start with the goal of improving his thinking, but over the years, it just happened.

Marlin’s story shows that being able to focus really well is a skill you need to work on. It might seem obvious, but many people think you can just decide to focus better overnight if you try hard enough. This idea is nice because it suggests that you can change from being distracted to focused quickly. But it ignores how hard it is to concentrate and how much practice you need to build your “mental muscle.” Marlin’s creative ideas come from his commitment to training his mind every morning, not just a one-time decision.

However, there’s something important to remember: if you want to focus better, you also need to stop relying on distractions. Just like athletes need to take care of their bodies outside of practice, you can’t expect to concentrate deeply if you’re always trying to avoid boredom. 

Research by Clifford Nass, a professor at Stanford, shows that constantly switching your attention online can harm your brain. He found that people who multitask a lot and those who don’t have very different brain functions.
