Adam Marlin was really smart when he started working—he has three degrees from top schools. But he met people who went to small religious schools and could still outsmart him. He said, “Many of these people are really successful in their jobs, but it wasn’t a fancy school that made them smart; it was their daily studying that started when they were in fifth grade.”

After some time, Marlin noticed he was thinking more deeply. He said, “I’ve been coming up with more creative ideas in my work. I believe it’s because of this daily mental practice. This consistent effort has built my brainpower over the years. I didn’t aim for this at first, but it’s what happened.”

Marlin’s story shows an important truth about deep work: being able to focus really well is a skill you need to practice. This might seem obvious once you think about it, but it’s different from what most people believe. Many people think of focus like a habit, like flossing your teeth—something you know is good for you but often forget to do because you lack motivation. This idea is tempting because it suggests you can go from being distracted to focused overnight if you just try hard enough. But this view ignores how tough it is to focus and how much practice it takes to build your “mental muscle.” The creative ideas Marlin has now in his job come from a daily commitment to training his mind, not just a one-time decision to think better.

However, there’s another important point: if you want to improve your focus, you also need to stop relying on distractions. Just like athletes need to take care of their bodies outside of training, you’ll find it hard to concentrate deeply if you’re always trying to escape boredom.

Research by Clifford Nass, a Stanford professor who studied behavior in the digital age, supports this idea. He found that constantly switching attention online can harm your brain. In a 2010 interview, Nass explained that they have ways to separate people into those who multitask all the time and those who don’t, and the differences between them are huge.
