This setup has soundproof offices connected to big common areas. It creates a place where people can both think deeply alone and meet others by chance. On one side, you have someone working alone, focused but not inspired. On the other side, there’s someone in an open office, full of ideas but having a hard time concentrating.

If we look back at Building 20 and Bell Labs, they had a similar design. They didn’t have modern open offices. Instead, they had private offices linked by shared hallways. The cool part was that these hallways made researchers bump into each other whenever they moved around. These long hallways acted like great meeting spots.

So, we can still say that open offices aren’t great for deep work, but we shouldn’t ignore the idea that creativity can happen when people accidentally meet. The trick is to have a mix: spend time in those meeting spots to get inspired, but also have a quiet space to focus on your work.

However, just going back to work alone isn’t always the best plan. Take the invention of the transistor at Bell Labs, for example. It happened because a big group of researchers, each with their own skills, came together to form a team focused on creating a smaller and better version of the vacuum tube. Their teamwork and discussions were crucial for inventing the transistor, showing how important those meeting spots are.

Once the group laid the groundwork, the work shifted to a more focused setting. But even then, it was still a team effort. Two researchers, Walter Brattain and John Bardeen, worked closely together for a month in 1947. They made the breakthroughs that led to the first working solid-state transistor. Brattain and Bardeen spent a lot of time in a small lab, working side by side.
