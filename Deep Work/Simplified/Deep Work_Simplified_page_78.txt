This setup has soundproof offices linked to big common areas. It creates a mix of spaces where people can bump into each other and also have quiet time to think deeply. On one side, you have people working alone, which means they can focus without distractions but might miss out on new ideas. On the other side, there are people working together in open offices, which are full of inspiration but can make it hard to concentrate on deep work.

Looking at Building 20 and Bell Labs, they used a similar design. These buildings didn’t have modern open office layouts. Instead, they had private offices connected by shared hallways. The creative energy came from these long hallways that made researchers interact whenever they moved from one place to another. These big hallways acted as great meeting spots.

So, we can say that open offices might not be the best for deep work, but we shouldn’t ignore the idea that creativity can come from unexpected interactions. The trick is to have a mix: spend time in hubs to get inspired, but also have quiet spaces to focus on what you learn.

However, just having quiet time alone isn’t always the best way to work. For example, when the transistor was invented at Bell Labs, it was thanks to a big group of researchers with different skills who worked together. They formed a team focused on creating a smaller and better alternative to the vacuum tube. Their teamwork and discussions were crucial for the invention of the transistor, showing how important collaboration is.

After the team laid the groundwork, the process moved to a quieter space. But even then, it stayed collaborative. Two researchers, Walter Brattain and John Bardeen, worked closely in a small lab for a month in 1947 to make the breakthroughs that led to the first solid-state transistor. They teamed up during this time and often worked side by side.
