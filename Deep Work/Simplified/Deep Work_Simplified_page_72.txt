You need enough of the right food to keep your energy up, and doing light exercise like walking can help clear your mind. As Nietzsche said, “Only ideas from walking are worth anything.” You also want to set up your workspace so it’s easy to work without wasting energy on distractions, like how Caro organized his materials. To be successful, you have to support your deep work efforts. But make sure this support is organized so you don’t waste mental energy figuring things out while you’re working.

These questions can help you start creating your own deep work routine. Just remember that finding a routine that works for you might take some trial and error, so be ready to put in the effort. It’s worth it! Once you find a routine that feels right, it can really make a difference. Deep work is important and shouldn’t be taken lightly. Having a special (and maybe a bit unusual) routine helps your mind focus so you can create things that matter.

In early winter 2007, J.K. Rowling was having a tough time finishing The Deathly Hallows, the last book in her Harry Potter series. There was a lot of pressure because she had to connect all the previous six books in a way that would please millions of fans. Rowling needed to focus deeply, but it was hard to do that at her home office in Edinburgh, Scotland. She said, “When I was finishing Deathly Hallows, the window cleaner came, the kids were home, and the dogs were barking.” It was too distracting, so she decided to do something drastic to help her focus: she booked a room at the fancy Balmoral Hotel in downtown Edinburgh. She explained, “I came to this hotel because it’s beautiful, but I didn’t plan to stay long. But the first day of writing went well, so I kept coming back… and I ended up finishing the last Harry Potter book here.”

Looking back, it makes sense that Rowling stayed at the hotel. The place was perfect for her work. The Balmoral is one of Scotland’s most luxurious hotels, featuring classic Victorian architecture with beautiful stonework and a tall clock.
