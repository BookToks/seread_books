Sometimes, people might question or ignore you, and that’s totally fine. Tim Ferriss, an author, said, “Get used to letting small problems happen. If you don’t, you won’t have time for the big, important stuff.” It’s good to know that, according to professors at MIT, people quickly change what they expect based on how you communicate. If you don’t reply to their quick messages, it probably isn’t a big deal for them.

Once you get over feeling weird about this, you’ll start to see the benefits. There are two common ideas people talk about when it comes to too many emails. One idea is that sending emails just leads to more emails, and the other is that dealing with confusing or pointless emails causes a lot of stress. The method suggested here tackles both problems—you send fewer emails and ignore the ones that are hard to deal with. This way, you’ll take back control of your time and attention from your inbox.
