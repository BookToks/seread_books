Sometimes, people might question you or just ignore you. That’s totally fine. Tim Ferriss, a well-known author, once said, “Get used to letting small problems happen. If you don’t, you won’t have time for the big, important things in life.” 

It’s good to know that, as researchers at MIT found out, people quickly adjust their expectations based on how you communicate. If you don’t reply to their quick messages, it’s probably not a big deal for them.

Once you get over the awkwardness of this idea, you’ll start to see the benefits. There are two common ideas people talk about when it comes to dealing with too many emails. One idea is that sending emails leads to even more emails, and the other is that dealing with confusing or unimportant emails causes a lot of stress. 

The method suggested here tackles both problems. You send fewer emails and ignore the ones that are hard to deal with. By doing this, you’ll take back control of your time and attention from your inbox.
