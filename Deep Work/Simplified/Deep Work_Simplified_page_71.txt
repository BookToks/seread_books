In a column for the New York Times, David Brooks says it straight: “Great creative minds think like artists but work like accountants.” This means that to get the most out of your focused work time, you should create strict routines like the famous thinkers he talks about. There’s a good reason for this. Smart people like Caro and Darwin didn’t have these routines just to be different; they did it because their success depended on their ability to focus deeply over and over again. You can’t win a big award or come up with a great idea without really pushing your brain. Their routines helped them switch to deep thinking more easily and stay focused longer. If they had just waited for a good idea to come to them, they probably wouldn’t have achieved as much.

There isn’t just one right way to create a deep work routine; it really depends on the person and the project. But there are some important questions any good routine should answer:

• Where you’ll work and for how long. You need to pick a specific place for your focused work. This could be as simple as your usual office with the door closed and a clean desk. One of my colleagues even puts a “do not disturb” sign on his door when he’s working on something tough. If you can find a spot that’s only for deep work, like a quiet library or a conference room, that can help even more. If you work in an open office, finding a place to focus becomes super important. Also, make sure to set a specific time limit for your session so it feels like a challenge, not just endless work.

• How you’ll work once you start. Your routine needs some rules to keep you on track. For example, you might decide not to use the Internet or track how many words you write every twenty minutes to stay focused. Without these rules, you’ll waste energy thinking about what you should or shouldn’t be doing during your work time, which can drain your willpower.

• How you’ll support your work. Your routine should help your brain stay sharp and focused. For instance, you might start with a good cup of coffee or make sure you have snacks nearby.
