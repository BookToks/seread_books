how talented this kid is?”), but Sertillanges and Ericsson both show that hard work and focus are what really lead to success. 

Deep work helps you learn tough stuff quickly. Sertillanges, a Dominican friar and professor, wrote a book called *The Intellectual Life*. He wanted to help people who want to make a living by thinking and sharing ideas. In his book, he talks about how important it is to understand complicated topics and gives tips on how to do that. This is super helpful for anyone trying to learn difficult skills fast.

To get what Sertillanges means, let’s look at his quote again. He says that to really get better in your field, you have to focus hard on the important topics. This means you need to concentrate a lot to find the truth in what you’re studying. His idea was ahead of its time because it took a long while for people to realize how important focus is for mastering hard tasks.

In the 1970s, psychologists started to study what makes experts different from regular people. K. Anders Ericsson, a professor, put all this research together in the early 1990s and called it "deliberate practice." He argued that the differences between experts and regular people come from years of focused effort to get better at something specific.

In American culture, we often hear about child prodigies, but both Sertillanges and Ericsson show that it’s really hard work and dedication that lead to real success.
