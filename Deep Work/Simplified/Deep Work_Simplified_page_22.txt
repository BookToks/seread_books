the next big thing?”) and the idea that some people are just naturally talented. But Sertillanges and Ericsson show us that becoming really good at something takes hard work and focus, not just talent.

Deep Work Helps You Quickly Learn Hard Things

“Let your mind focus like a camera, and let your heart be fully into whatever idea you’re thinking about.” 

This advice is from Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges, a monk and teacher who wrote a small but important book called The Intellectual Life in the early 1900s. He wrote it to help people who want to work with ideas and think deeply. In the book, Sertillanges talks about how important it is to understand complicated stuff and gives tips on how to do it. That’s why his book is helpful for anyone trying to learn tough skills quickly.

To get what Sertillanges is saying, let’s look at his quote again. He believes that to really get better at your field, you need to study the important topics carefully, letting your focus help you find the truth in each one. In simpler terms, he teaches that learning needs serious concentration. This idea was ahead of its time. In the 1920s, Sertillanges figured out something about mastering hard tasks that took researchers another 70 years to fully understand.

This understanding started to take shape in the 1970s when a part of psychology called performance psychology began to look at what makes experts different from everyone else. In the early 1990s, K. Anders Ericsson, a professor at Florida State University, brought all this information together and gave it a catchy name: deliberate practice.

Ericsson starts his important paper on this topic with a strong statement: “We don’t believe that the differences between expert performers and regular people are set in stone… We think that what makes experts different is a lifetime of focused effort to get better in a specific area.”

In American culture, we often love stories about prodigies and people who seem to be naturally gifted. But Sertillanges and Ericsson show us that getting really good at something is about hard work and focus, not just being born with talent.
