When I was getting close to deadlines for my papers, I used a method called 4DX to keep my focus all year long. Honestly, it was a tiring year, especially since I was also writing this book. But it really showed me how effective the 4DX method is: by the summer of 2014, I had nine papers accepted for publication, which was way more than I had ever done in any previous year.

In a 2012 blog post for the New York Times, a writer and cartoonist named Tim Kreider described himself as “the laziest ambitious person I know.” He didn’t like being super busy, but he found himself overwhelmed with work before writing his post. He talked about how his mornings were filled with emails asking him to do things he didn’t want to do, which made him feel stressed.

To fix this, he escaped to what he called an “undisclosed location.” This was a place without TV or Internet, where he had to bike to the library if he wanted to go online. This helped him avoid all the little tasks that seemed harmless but actually distracted him from focusing on his important work. Kreider said that during this time, he remembered simple things like flowers and stars, read a lot, and finally got some real writing done after months of struggling.

It’s important to know that Kreider isn’t like the famous writer Thoreau, who left society to make a big statement. Instead, Kreider left the busyness behind because he realized it actually helped him do his job better. He explained that being idle isn’t just a break or a bad habit; it’s as important for our brains as vitamin D is for our bodies. Without it, we can feel mentally unwell. He believes that to do meaningful work, like writing or creating art, we need time to relax and let our minds rest.
