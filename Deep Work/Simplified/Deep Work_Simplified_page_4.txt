Introduction

In the Swiss area of St. Gallen, close to Lake Zurich, there’s a village called Bollingen. In 1922, a psychiatrist named Carl Jung decided to build a retreat there. He started with a simple two-story stone house that he named the Tower. After visiting India, where he saw homes with meditation rooms, he added a private office to the place. Jung said about his office, “In my retiring room I am by myself. I keep the key with me all the time; no one else is allowed in there except with my permission.”

In his book Daily Rituals, journalist Mason Currey looked into Jung’s life to share how he worked at the Tower. Jung would wake up at seven in the morning, and after a big breakfast, he would spend two hours writing without any distractions in his private office. His afternoons were usually filled with meditation or long walks in the beautiful countryside around him. There was no electricity in the Tower, so when it got dark, he used oil lamps for light and a fireplace for warmth. Jung would go to bed by ten p.m. He said, “The feeling of repose and renewal that I had in this tower was intense from the start.”

It might be easy to think of Bollingen Tower as just a vacation spot, but when we look at Jung’s career at that time, it’s clear that he didn’t build it to escape work. In 1922, when he bought the property, he couldn’t afford a vacation. Just a year before, in 1921, he published a big book called Psychological Types, which showed how his ideas were different from those of his old friend and mentor, Sigmund Freud. Disagreeing with Freud back then was a big deal. Jung needed to keep his mind sharp and write more articles and books to support his new ideas about psychology.

Jung was busy with lectures and his counseling practice in Zurich, but he wanted more than just being busy. He wanted to change how people understood the unconscious mind, and that needed deeper thinking than he could do in the busy city. So, he went to Bollingen, not to run away from his work, but to help it grow.
