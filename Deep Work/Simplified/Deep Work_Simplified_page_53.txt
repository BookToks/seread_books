They talk about a master wheelwright, which is a job that’s now gone where people made wooden wagon wheels. They say, “Every piece of wood is unique and has its own character.” After explaining how the wheelwright works, they mention that the woodworker really connects with the wood. The special qualities of the wood need to be nurtured and taken care of. 

This connection helps the craftsman find meaning in a world that often feels empty. The wheelwright doesn’t just pick what parts of the wood are important; the value is already there in the wood and what it’s meant to do. 

Dreyfus and Kelly explain that this sense of importance is common in craftsmanship. They say the craftsman’s job isn’t to create meaning but to learn how to recognize the meanings that already exist. This helps the craftsman avoid the emptiness that comes from focusing only on themselves and gives them a clearer sense of purpose. Plus, this meaning feels more secure than what people believed in the past. The wheelwright can’t easily use the qualities of a piece of wood to support a bad government. 

When looking at job satisfaction, Dreyfus and Kelly’s view of craftsmanship helps us understand why people like Ric Furrer, who works with metals, make so many people happy. The satisfaction on Furrer’s face while he creates art from rough metals shows appreciation for something valuable in today’s world: a hint of something sacred. 

Once we get this idea of sacredness in traditional craftsmanship, we can relate it to modern jobs that involve knowledge. First, we need to recognize something important: it’s not just manual work that brings this kind of meaning. Any job, whether it’s hands-on or mental, that requires a high level of skill can also feel sacred. 

To explain this, let’s move from old jobs like woodworking or metalworking to a modern job like computer programming. Santiago Gonzalez, a talented coder, describes his work by saying: “Beautiful code is short and clear, so if you showed it to another programmer, they would think, ‘Wow, that’s well-written code.’ It’s kind of like writing a poem.”
