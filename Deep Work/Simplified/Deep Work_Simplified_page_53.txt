They talk about a master wheelwright, someone who used to make wooden wagon wheels. They say, “Each piece of wood is unique and has its own character.” The wheelwright has a close connection with the wood he uses. He understands the special qualities of the wood and knows how to take care of it. This appreciation for the wood shows that the craftsman has found something important in a world that often feels empty: a meaning that comes from outside himself. The wheelwright doesn’t just pick what parts of the wood are important; those qualities are already there in the wood and the job he’s doing.

Dreyfus and Kelly explain that this sense of importance is common in craftsmanship. They say that a craftsman’s job is not to create meaning but to learn how to see the meanings that already exist. This helps the craftsman avoid feeling lost in a world where everything seems about individual choices. It gives him a clearer sense of purpose. Plus, this meaning feels more secure than what people believed in the past. The authors suggest that the wheelwright can’t easily use the wood’s qualities to support a bad government.

When looking at job satisfaction, Dreyfus and Kelly’s view of craftsmanship helps us understand why people like Ric Furrer find joy in their work. The happiness on Furrer’s face as he turns rough metals into art shows he appreciates something special in today’s world: a touch of the sacred.

We can relate this sacredness in traditional craftsmanship to modern jobs that involve knowledge. First, we need to recognize that it’s not just about manual work when it comes to finding this kind of meaning. Any job, whether it’s physical or mental, that requires a lot of skill can also create a sense of sacredness.

To explain this further, let’s look at something modern like computer programming. Santiago Gonzalez, a talented coder, describes his work by saying, “Beautiful code is short and clear, so if you showed it to another programmer, they would think, ‘Wow, that’s really well done.’ It’s a lot like writing a poem.”
