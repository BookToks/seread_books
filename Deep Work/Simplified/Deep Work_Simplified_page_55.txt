The second important point here is that developing your skills takes a lot of hard work and focus. Remember, I mentioned in Chapter 1 that deep work is essential for getting really good at something and using those skills at a high level. Deep work helps you find real meaning in your job, like Dreyfus and Kelly talked about. So, if you want to make deep work a part of your career and use it to improve your skills, it can change your job from something boring and exhausting into something exciting and fulfilling.

In the first two chapters of Part 1, I talked about how deep work is becoming more valuable in our economy, but it's also getting harder to find. This creates a gap in the market: if you learn this skill, you’ll do really well in your career. This last chapter doesn’t add much to the practical advice about getting ahead at work, but it’s super important for understanding the earlier ideas. The upcoming pages will explain a tough plan to change your work life to focus on depth. This change isn’t easy, and while good reasons can inspire you, eventually, you need a deeper connection to your goals.

This chapter says that when you dive deep into your work, that connection is unavoidable. Whether you look at it through science, psychology, or philosophy, they all point to a link between depth and finding meaning in life. It’s like we’ve evolved to thrive in deep experiences and struggle in shallow ones, becoming what we might call Homo sapiens deepensis. I previously quoted Winifred Gallagher, who said, “I’ll live the focused life because it’s the best kind there is.” This sums up the main idea of this chapter and Part 1: living deeply is living well, no matter how you see it.
