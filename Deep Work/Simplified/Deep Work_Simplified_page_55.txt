The second important point is that developing your skills takes a lot of effort and focus. Remember, I mentioned before that deep work is needed to really improve your abilities and use them at a high level, which is essential for mastering a craft. Deep work helps you find real meaning in your job, as explained by Dreyfus and Kelly. So, if you commit to deep work in your career and focus on improving your skills, it can change your job from something boring and tiring into something enjoyable—a way to discover amazing things.

The first two chapters talked about how deep work is becoming more valuable in today’s job market, but it’s also getting harder to find for some random reasons. This creates a situation where if you develop this skill, you’ll do really well in your career. This last chapter doesn’t add much to the practical advice about getting ahead at work, but it’s super important for understanding the earlier ideas. The following pages will explain a detailed plan for changing your work life to focus on depth. This change is tough, and while good reasons can inspire you, they can only motivate you so much. Eventually, the goal you chase needs to connect with you on a personal level.

This chapter suggests that when it comes to focusing on depth, that connection is unavoidable. Whether you look at it through science, psychology, or deep thoughts, they all point to a link between depth and meaning. It’s like we’ve evolved into a species that thrives on depth and struggles with shallow things, which we could call Homo sapiens deepensis.

I previously quoted Winifred Gallagher, who embraced depth, saying, “I’ll live the focused life, because it’s the best kind there is.” This sums up the main idea of this chapter and the first part: living a deep life is a good life, no matter how you see it.
