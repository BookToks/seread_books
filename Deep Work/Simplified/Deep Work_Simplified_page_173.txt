After Malcolm Gladwell made the idea of deliberate practice popular in his 2008 book, *Outliers: The Story of Success*, people in psychology started to question it. They were usually skeptical of Gladwell's ideas. Most of the studies didn’t prove that deliberate practice wasn’t important; instead, they tried to find other factors that also help people become experts.

In a 2013 article called “Why Expert Performance Is Special and Cannot Be Extrapolated from Studies of Performance in the General Population: A Response to Criticisms,” published in the journal *Intelligence*, Ericsson responded to many of these studies. He argued that the way these studies were designed was often flawed. They assumed that the difference between average and above-average performers could be compared to the difference between experts and non-experts, which isn’t accurate.
