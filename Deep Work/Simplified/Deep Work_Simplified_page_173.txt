After Malcolm Gladwell made the idea of deliberate practice popular in his 2008 book, Outliers: The Story of Success, some people in psychology started to question it. They were generally skeptical of Gladwell's ideas. However, most of these studies didn’t completely dismiss the importance of deliberate practice. Instead, they looked for other factors that might also help people become experts. 

In a 2013 article called “Why Expert Performance Is Special and Cannot Be Extrapolated from Studies of Performance in the General Population: A Response to Criticisms,” published in the journal Intelligence, Ericsson responded to these criticisms. He argued that many of the studies that challenged his ideas were not well-designed. They wrongly assumed that the difference between average and above-average performers could be compared to the difference between experts and non-experts.
