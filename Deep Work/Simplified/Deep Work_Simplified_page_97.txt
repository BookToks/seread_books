Point #2: 

No matter how you plan your Internet time, you have to keep the time outside those blocks completely free from using the Internet. 

This sounds simple, but it can get tricky during a busy workday. You might find yourself in an offline block and suddenly realize you need something important from the Internet to keep going with your task. If your next Internet block is still a while away, you could feel stuck. The easy choice is to quickly look up what you need and then go back to your offline work. 

But you have to fight that urge! The Internet can be really distracting. You might think you’re just checking one important email, but then you’ll end up looking at other “urgent” messages that pop up. If you keep making exceptions, your brain will start to see the line between online and offline time as blurry, which makes this strategy less effective. 

So, it’s really important not to give up on your offline block, even if you feel stuck. If you can, switch to a different offline activity for the rest of that time, or just take a break. If you really need to finish what you’re doing right away, then adjust your schedule to start your next Internet block sooner. But don’t jump online right away! Make sure to wait at least five minutes before you go back online. This short wait isn’t a big deal, but it helps separate your urge to go online from actually doing it. 

Point #3: 

Planning your Internet use at home and work can help you focus better. 

If you’re always on your phone or laptop during evenings and weekends, it’s likely that this is messing up your efforts to concentrate during the workday. Your brain doesn’t really see a difference between work and home in this case. So, I suggest you keep scheduling your Internet time even after work is done.
