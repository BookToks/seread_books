Point #2: 

No matter how you plan your Internet time, you have to make sure you don’t use the Internet outside those times. 

This sounds simple, but it can get tricky during a regular workday. You might find yourself in an offline period and suddenly realize you need some important info online to keep working on your task. If your next Internet time isn’t for a while, you could feel stuck. The easy choice is to quickly check online, grab the info, and then go back to your offline work. 

But you have to fight that urge! The Internet can be really distracting. You might think you’re just checking one important email, but then you’ll see other “urgent” messages and want to check those too. If you keep making exceptions, your brain will start to blur the lines between online and offline time, which defeats the purpose of this plan. 

So, if you get stuck, don’t just give up on your offline time. If you can, switch to a different offline activity for the rest of that time (or take a break). If you really need to finish what you’re doing, then change your schedule so your next Internet time starts sooner. But don’t jump right back online! Make sure to have at least a five-minute break before you go back. This little gap won’t slow you down too much, but it helps separate the feeling of wanting to go online from actually doing it. 

Point #3: 

Planning your Internet use at home and work can help you focus even more. 

If you find yourself always on your phone or laptop during evenings and weekends, it might be messing up your focus from the workday. Your brain doesn’t really see a difference between work and home. So, I suggest you keep planning your Internet time even after work is done.
