The first answers to this question look at the personal traits and strategies that helped this group succeed. The second type of answers is broader and focuses less on the individuals and more on the kind of work they represent. Both types of answers are important, but the broader ones are more relevant to our discussion because they show what our current economy values.

To understand this broader view, we look at two MIT economists, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee. In their important 2011 book, "Race Against the Machine," they argue that digital technology is changing our job market in surprising ways. They say, “We are in the early stages of a Great Restructuring.” They explain that while technology is advancing quickly, many people's skills and organizations are not keeping up. This gap could mean bad news for many workers. As machines get smarter and closer to human abilities, employers are more likely to hire machines instead of people. When they do need a human, new communication tools make remote work easier, leading companies to hire top talent from anywhere, leaving local workers struggling to find jobs.

However, this situation isn’t all bad. Brynjolfsson and McAfee point out that this Great Restructuring isn’t making all jobs worse; it’s actually splitting them. While some people will lose their jobs because their skills can be automated or outsourced, others will not only keep their jobs but also become more valuable and earn more than before. Brynjolfsson and McAfee aren’t the only ones who think this way. In 2013, economist Tyler Cowen wrote a book called "Average Is Over," which shares a similar idea about this divide in the economy. What makes Brynjolfsson and McAfee’s analysis especially helpful is that they identify three specific groups that will benefit the most in this new age of intelligent machines. Not surprisingly, the people in these groups include Nate Silver, Hansson, and Doerr. Let’s look at each of these groups to understand why they are suddenly so important.

The High-Skilled Workers are the first group that Brynjolfsson and McAfee talk about.
