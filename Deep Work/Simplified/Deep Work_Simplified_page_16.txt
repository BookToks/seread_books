to this question. The first answers look at the personal traits and strategies that helped this group succeed. The second answers focus more on the overall work they represent rather than just the individuals. Both types of answers are important, but the overall answers are more relevant to our discussion because they show what our current economy values.

To understand this bigger picture, we look at two MIT economists, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee. In their important 2011 book, *Race Against the Machine*, they argue that digital technology is changing our job market in surprising ways. They say, “We are in the early stages of a big change.” Our technology is advancing quickly, but many of our skills and organizations are falling behind. This gap is bad news for many workers. As smart machines get better, employers are more likely to hire “new machines” instead of “new people.” And when they do need a human, the rise of communication technology makes remote work easier, leading companies to hire top talent from anywhere, leaving local workers struggling to find jobs.

However, this situation isn’t all bad. Brynjolfsson and McAfee point out that this big change isn’t hurting all jobs but is actually splitting them. While some people will lose their jobs because their skills can be automated or outsourced, others will not only keep their jobs but will also be more valued and rewarded than before. Brynjolfsson and McAfee aren’t the only ones who think this way. In 2013, economist Tyler Cowen published *Average Is Over*, which shares a similar idea about a digital divide. What makes Brynjolfsson and McAfee’s analysis especially helpful is that they identify three specific groups that will benefit the most in this new age of intelligent machines. Not surprisingly, the people in these three groups include Silver, Hansson, and Doerr. Let’s look at each of these groups to understand why they are suddenly so important.

The High-Skilled Workers  
Brynjolfsson and McAfee refer to the group represented by Nate Silver as the “high-skilled” workers.
