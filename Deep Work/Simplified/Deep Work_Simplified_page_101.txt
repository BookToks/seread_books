Massachusetts Avenue Bridge. After a quick lunch and shower at home, I usually took the subway across the river to get back to campus. This saved me about a third of a mile on my walk home after work. Basically, I spent a lot of time on my feet during this time. This made me come up with a practice that I think you should try for your own deep work training: productive meditation.

The idea of productive meditation is to use times when you’re physically busy but not really thinking—like walking, jogging, driving, or showering—and focus on one specific work problem. Depending on what you do, this could be planning an article, writing a speech, solving a tough problem, or improving a business plan. Just like in mindfulness meditation, you need to keep bringing your mind back to the problem if it starts to wander.

I used to do productive meditation during at least one of my daily walks across the river while living in Boston. As I practiced more, I got better results. For example, I figured out the chapter outlines for a big part of my last book while walking, and I made progress on tricky problems in my research.

I think you should try productive meditation in your own life. You don’t need to do it every day, but aim for at least two or three sessions each week. The good news is that it’s easy to find time for this since it uses moments that would usually be wasted, like walking the dog or commuting. If done right, it can actually help you get more done instead of taking time away from your work. You might even want to plan a walk during your workday just to focus on your biggest problem.

I’m not just suggesting this for the productivity boost (though that’s a nice bonus). I really care about how it can help you think more deeply. From my experience, productive meditation builds on the key ideas I mentioned earlier. By making you fight distractions and keep your focus on one problem, it helps you get better at resisting distractions and improves your concentration.

To get good at productive meditation, remember that, like any type of meditation, it takes practice. When I first tried this strategy,
