Massachusetts Avenue Bridge. After a quick lunch and shower at home, I usually took the subway across the river to get back to campus. This saved me about a third of a mile on my walk home after work. Basically, I spent a lot of time on my feet during this time. This is what made me start a practice that I think you should try too: productive meditation.

The idea of productive meditation is to use times when you’re busy physically but not mentally—like walking, jogging, driving, or showering—to focus on one specific work problem. Depending on what you do, this could be planning an article, writing a speech, solving a tough math problem, or figuring out a business plan. Just like with mindfulness meditation, you need to keep bringing your mind back to the problem whenever it wanders off.

I used to do productive meditation during at least one of my walks across the river when I lived in Boston, and as I got better at it, my results improved too. For example, I figured out the chapter outlines for a big part of my last book while walking, and I made progress on some tricky problems in my research.

I think you should try productive meditation in your life. You don’t have to do it every day, but aim for at least two or three times a week. The good news is that it’s easy to find time for this since it uses moments that would normally be wasted, like walking the dog or commuting. If done right, it can actually help you get more done instead of taking time away from your work. You might even want to plan a walk during your workday just to think about your biggest problem.

I’m not just suggesting this for the productivity benefits (though those are great). I’m really interested in how it can help you think more deeply. From my experience, productive meditation builds on the key ideas I mentioned earlier. By making you resist distractions and keep focusing on one problem, it strengthens your ability to ignore distractions. Plus, it helps you dive deeper into your thoughts about that problem, which sharpens your concentration.

To get good at productive meditation, remember that, like any type of meditation, it takes practice. When I first tried this method,
