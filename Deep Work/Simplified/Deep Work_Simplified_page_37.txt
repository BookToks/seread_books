One example of how businesses can mess up is by doing things that don’t really help them grow. A lot of people stick to what’s easy instead of what’s best. 

Take meetings, for instance. Companies often have regular meetings for projects, which can pile up and mess up everyone’s schedules. This makes it hard to focus on work. Why do they keep happening? Because they’re easy. 

For many people, these meetings are a simple way to stay organized. Instead of managing their time better, they let the weekly meeting push them to do something on a project. It gives them a false sense of progress.

Another annoying habit is sending emails to coworkers with vague questions like “Thoughts?” These emails take only a few seconds to write but can waste a lot of time for the people who have to respond. If the sender spent a bit more time writing a clear message, everyone would save time. But why do people do this? Because it’s easier for them. It helps them clear their inbox with little effort.

This idea of taking the easy way out, without thinking about how it affects the work, creates a culture where people avoid the hard work of focusing and planning. This might feel good in the short term, but it doesn’t lead to real success. It pushes us toward shallow work instead of the deep work that really matters. 

Next, we’ll talk about how being busy is often mistaken for being productive. 

Being a professor at a research university can be tough, but one good thing is that it’s clear if you’re doing well or not. The main question is: Are you publishing important papers? This can even be measured with a number called the h-index.
