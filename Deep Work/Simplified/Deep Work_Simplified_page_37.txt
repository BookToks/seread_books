One example of how businesses can act in ways that don’t really help them is when they focus on what’s easy instead of what’s best. For instance, many companies have regular meetings for projects. These meetings can pile up and make it hard for people to concentrate on their work. Why do they keep happening? Because they’re easier. 

For a lot of people, these meetings are a simple way to stay organized. Instead of managing their time and tasks on their own, they let these meetings push them to do something about a project. It gives them a false sense of progress.

Another annoying habit is sending an email to coworkers with just a simple question like, “Thoughts?” Writing these emails takes only a few seconds, but they can waste a lot of time for the people who have to respond. If the sender took a little more time to write a clear message, everyone could save a lot of time. So why do people keep sending these time-wasting emails? Because they’re easier. It helps them clear out their inbox with minimal effort.

This idea of taking the easy way out leads to work cultures that avoid the hard work of focusing and planning. While this might feel good in the short term, it hurts long-term satisfaction and real progress. This trend pushes us toward shallow work, even though today’s economy rewards deeper, more meaningful work. But this isn’t the only issue that makes it hard to focus. We also need to think about the constant pressure to be “productive,” which we’ll discuss next.

Being a professor at a research university can be tough, but one good thing about it is that it’s clear how you’re doing. You can measure your success as a researcher with a simple question: Are you publishing important papers? This can even be summed up in a single number, like the h-index, which is a formula named after its creator.
