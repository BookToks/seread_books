It's too vague to say "doing better research," but saying "finish paper on broadcast lower bounds for the upcoming conference" is too specific since it's just a one-time thing. A better goal would be something like: "regularly read and understand the latest results in my field."

Next, think about the tools you use. For each tool, check how it affects the key activities you identified. Does it help a lot, hurt a lot, or have little effect on how well you do those activities? The important choice is to keep using a tool only if it helps a lot and the benefits are greater than the downsides.

To show how this works, let’s look at an example. Imagine Michael Lewis has a goal for his writing career. His goal is to create well-written stories that change how people see the world.

To support this goal, he has key activities like:
• Research deeply and patiently.
• Write carefully and with purpose.

Now, let’s say Lewis is deciding whether to use Twitter. He needs to see how Twitter affects his key activities. It’s hard to say that Twitter would help him with either of these. Deep research means spending weeks and months getting to know a few sources really well, and careful writing needs him to focus without distractions. Twitter probably doesn’t help him much, and it could even be harmful because it can be addictive. So, he would probably decide not to use Twitter.

You might think it’s unfair to only look at this one goal since Twitter can help connect writers with their audience, which can lead to more sales. But for someone like Michael Lewis, marketing probably isn’t a big enough goal to focus on.
