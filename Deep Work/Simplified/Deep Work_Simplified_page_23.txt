how easy this is for me!?” Matt Damon’s character famously says in the movie Good Will Hunting when he quickly solves math problems that confuse the best mathematicians. The research by Ericsson, which is now widely accepted (with some exceptions), challenges the idea that natural talent is everything. To really master a tough skill, you need a special kind of practice—there aren’t many exceptions for those who are just naturally gifted. Sertillanges, a thinker from the past, also believed this. He said in his book, The Intellectual Life, that even geniuses became great by putting all their effort into the things they wanted to excel at. Ericsson couldn’t have said it better.

Now, let’s talk about what deliberate practice actually involves. It usually has two main parts: (1) you need to focus really hard on a specific skill you want to get better at or an idea you want to understand; (2) you get feedback so you can fix your approach and keep your focus where it’s most helpful. The first part is super important because it shows that deliberate practice can’t happen if you’re distracted. You need to concentrate without interruptions. As Ericsson points out, “Diffused attention is almost the opposite of the focused attention needed for deliberate practice.”

Ericsson and other researchers aren’t really looking into why deliberate practice works; they just know it does. Over the years since Ericsson’s first big papers on this topic, scientists studying the brain have been looking into how people improve at difficult tasks. In his 2009 book, The Talent Code, journalist Daniel Coyle explains that these scientists think myelin is part of the answer. Myelin is a fatty layer that grows around nerve cells, helping them send signals faster and more clearly. To understand how myelin helps you improve, remember that skills, whether they are mental or physical, come down to brain circuits. This new science suggests that you get better at something as you build more myelin around the right neurons, making the circuit work more smoothly and easily. Being great at something means you have a lot of myelin.

This understanding is important because it gives a scientific reason for why deliberate practice is effective. By focusing hard on a specific skill, you make the related brain circuit work over and over again. This repeated use of the circuit tells special cells called oligodendrocytes to wrap myelin around the neurons in that circuit, basically locking in the skill. So, it’s crucial to focus intensely on the task at hand.
