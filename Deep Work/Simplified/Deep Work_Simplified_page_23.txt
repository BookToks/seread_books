“Why is this so easy for me!?” Matt Damon’s character says in the movie Good Will Hunting when he quickly solves math problems that confuse the best mathematicians. This idea, backed by researcher Ericsson, challenges the belief that natural talent is the main reason for success. To really master a tough skill, you need a special kind of practice, and talent isn’t the only thing that matters. Sertillanges, who wrote The Intellectual Life, also believed this, saying that even geniuses became great by putting all their effort into what they wanted to achieve. Ericsson couldn’t agree more.

Now, let’s talk about what deliberate practice really means. It usually has two main parts: (1) you focus hard on a specific skill or idea you want to get better at; (2) you get feedback so you can fix your mistakes and keep your focus where it’s most helpful. The first part is super important because it shows that deliberate practice can’t happen if you’re distracted; you need to concentrate without interruptions. As Ericsson points out, “Being distracted is almost the opposite of the focused attention needed for deliberate practice.”

Ericsson and other researchers are not focused on why deliberate practice works; they just know it does. Over the years, scientists have been looking into how our brains help us improve at difficult tasks. In his book The Talent Code, journalist Daniel Coyle explains that scientists think myelin, a fatty layer that grows around brain cells, plays a big role. Myelin helps the brain cells work faster and better. When you practice a skill, your brain forms circuits, and the more myelin you have around those circuits, the easier it is to perform the skill. To be really good at something means you have a lot of myelin.

Understanding this is key because it explains why deliberate practice is effective. When you focus intensely on a skill, you make the specific brain circuit work over and over again. This repeated use signals special cells called oligodendrocytes to wrap myelin around the neurons in that circuit, which helps you master the skill. So, focusing hard on what you’re doing is crucial.
