This isn't just a weird thing happening; it's become the new normal. When the writer Jonathan Franzen wrote an article for the Guardian saying Twitter is bad for writers, a lot of people made fun of him for being out of touch. The magazine Slate called his complaints a "lonely war on the Internet," and another writer, Jennifer Weiner, said Franzen was just a unique case, a single voice making rules that only apply to him. A funny hashtag, #JonathanFranzenhates, became popular.

I bring up these trends because they show a contradiction. In the last chapter, I said that doing deep work is super important in today’s changing job market. If that's true, you would think that both people and companies would want to promote this skill to get the best from their workers. But as we've seen, that's not happening. Other ideas, like working together casually, quick communication, and being active on social media, are seen as more important than deep work in the business world.

It’s frustrating that so many trends are valued more than deep work, but it gets worse because many of these trends actually make it harder to focus. For example, open offices might help people work together more, but they also create a lot of distractions. A neuroscientist who studied this found that even a phone ringing in the background can ruin your concentration. “Even if you don’t notice it at the time, your brain reacts to distractions,” he said.

The same problems happen with instant messaging. Emails can only distract you when you check them, but instant messaging is always on, making interruptions worse. Gloria Mark, a professor who studies how attention gets broken up, found that even a short interruption can make it take much longer to finish a task. “People said this was really harmful,” she noted.

Having content creators use social media also hurts their ability to focus. Serious journalists, for instance, need to concentrate on their work—digging into complex information, finding connections, and writing well. Asking them to stop this deep thinking to post on social media throughout the day is not helpful.
