This isn’t just a weird trend; it’s becoming the usual way things are. When author Jonathan Franzen wrote an article for the Guardian saying that Twitter is a bad influence on writers, a lot of people made fun of him for being out of touch. The online magazine Slate called his complaints a “lonely war on the Internet,” and another writer, Jennifer Weiner, responded in The New Republic, saying, “Franzen is all alone, making rules that only apply to him.” Soon, the sarcastic hashtag #JonathanFranzenhates became popular.

I bring up these trends because they show a contradiction. In the last chapter, I said that doing deep work is super important in today’s changing economy. If that’s true, you’d think that not only ambitious people but also companies would encourage this skill to get the best from their workers. But, as the examples show, that’s not happening. Instead, other ideas like casual teamwork, quick communication, and being active on social media are seen as more important than deep work in the business world.

It’s frustrating that so many trends are prioritized over deep work, and on top of that, many of these trends actually make it harder to focus. For example, open offices might help people work together more, but they also create “massive distraction,” according to experiments from a British TV show called The Secret Life of Office Buildings. A neuroscientist who worked on the show said, “If you’re just getting into your work and a phone goes off in the background, it ruins your concentration.” Even if you don’t notice it, your brain reacts to distractions.

The same problems happen with real-time messaging. Email can only distract you when you check it, but instant messaging is always on, making interruptions even worse. Gloria Mark, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, studies how distractions break our focus. In a well-known study, she and her team watched workers in real offices and found that even short interruptions can significantly delay how long it takes to finish a task. “People said this was really harmful,” she noted in a typical academic way.

Putting content creators on social media also hurts their ability to focus. Serious journalists, for example, need to concentrate on their work—digging into complex sources, finding connections, and writing strong articles. So asking them to stop this deep thinking throughout the day to engage on social media is not helpful.
