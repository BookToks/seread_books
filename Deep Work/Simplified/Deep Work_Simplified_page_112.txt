I can make money by selling the animals, and they also produce manure that helps my soil. When I buy hay, I’m not just spending money; I’m getting animal protein and manure, which gives my land more nutrients. Plus, I avoid damaging my soil by not driving heavy machines over it all summer.

When Pritchard decided on the baler, he looked beyond just the money. He focused on how it would affect the long-term health of his fields. He figured that buying hay would keep his fields healthier. He said, “Soil fertility is my baseline.” So, he decided not to get the baler.

Pritchard’s decision shows how complicated choosing tools can be. It’s not enough to just see some benefits; people in his field know that every tool has its pros and cons. He started with what mattered most to him—healthy soil—and then made his decision about the tool.

If you’re someone who works with knowledge, especially if you want to build good work habits, you should choose your tools carefully, just like farmers do. I call this the craftsman approach to tool selection. It means that tools should help you reach your bigger goals.

The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection says to figure out what really matters for your success and happiness. Only pick a tool if its good points are way better than its bad points. This approach is different from just looking for any benefit. While some people think any positive impact is enough to use a tool, the craftsman approach wants those benefits to really matter to you and be better than the downsides.

Even though the craftsman approach doesn’t ignore the reasons people like certain tools, it doesn’t make quick judgments about what’s good or bad technology either.
