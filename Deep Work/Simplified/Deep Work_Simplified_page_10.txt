Benn did really well because he prepared and learned how to focus deeply. He said, “Some people show up not ready. They can’t concentrate. They can’t learn fast.” Only half of the students who started the program with him graduated on time. But Benn not only graduated; he was the top student in his class. His hard work paid off because he quickly got a job as a developer at a tech start-up in San Francisco that had $25 million in funding and lots of choices for employees.

Before this, Benn was a financial consultant making $40,000 a year. Now, as a computer developer, he makes $100,000, and his salary can keep growing as he gets better at his job. When I last talked to Benn, he was doing great in his new role. He loved deep work so much that he rented an apartment right across from his office. This way, he could get to work early and focus without distractions. He told me, “On good days, I can get in four hours of focus before the first meeting. Then maybe another three to four hours in the afternoon. And I do mean ‘focus’: no e-mail, no Hacker News, just programming.” It’s amazing how he changed from spending almost all day online at his old job to being so focused now.

Benn’s story teaches us an important lesson: Deep work isn’t just something writers or old philosophers talk about. It’s a valuable skill today. There are two main reasons for this. First, we live in an information economy where things change fast. For example, some computer languages Benn learned didn’t even exist ten years ago and might be outdated in another ten years. Similarly, someone in marketing in the 1990s wouldn’t have known they’d need to learn digital analytics today. To stay valuable in today’s economy, you need to learn complicated things quickly, and that takes deep work. If you don’t develop this skill, you might fall behind as technology moves forward.

The second reason deep work is important is that the digital world can be both good and bad. If you can create something useful, a huge number of people can see it, which can lead to great rewards. But if what you make is just okay, you’re in trouble because it’s easy for people to find something better online. Whether you’re a programmer, writer, marketer, consultant, or entrepreneur,
