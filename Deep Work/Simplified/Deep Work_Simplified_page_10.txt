Benn did really well because he prepared and learned how to focus deeply. 

“Some people show up not ready,” he said. “They can’t concentrate. They can’t learn fast.” Only half of the students who started the program with Benn graduated on time. But Benn not only graduated; he was the best student in his class. His hard work paid off. He quickly got a job as a developer at a tech start-up in San Francisco that had $25 million in funding and lots of choices for employees. 

Just six months before, Benn had quit his job as a financial consultant, where he was making $40,000 a year. His new job as a computer developer paid $100,000, and that amount could keep growing a lot in Silicon Valley, especially as he got better at his skills. 

When I last talked to Benn, he was doing great in his new job. He really believed in deep work now, so he rented an apartment right across from his office. This way, he could get to work early before anyone else and focus without distractions. “On good days, I can get in four hours of focus before the first meeting,” he told me. “Then maybe another three to four hours in the afternoon. And I mean ‘focus’: no e-mail, no Hacker News, just programming.” For someone who used to spend almost all day browsing the Web at his old job, Benn’s change is amazing.

Benn’s story teaches an important lesson: Deep work isn’t just something writers or old philosophers talk about. It’s a skill that’s really important today. 

There are two main reasons why this skill matters. The first is about learning. We live in an information economy that relies on complicated systems that change quickly. Some programming languages Benn learned didn’t even exist ten years ago and might be outdated in another ten years. Similarly, someone working in marketing in the 1990s wouldn’t have known they’d need to learn digital analytics today. To stay valuable in our economy, you need to get good at learning complicated things fast. This takes deep work. If you don’t work on this skill, you might get left behind as technology moves forward.

The second reason deep work is important is because of the digital network revolution. If you can create something useful, you can reach a huge audience (like employers or customers), which can really increase your rewards. But if what you make is just okay, you’re in trouble because it’s easy for people to find something better online. Whether you’re a computer programmer, writer, marketer, consultant, or entrepreneur,
