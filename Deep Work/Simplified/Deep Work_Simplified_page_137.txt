and this is the important part—try to stick to this budget. (The tips before and after this one will help you reach this goal.)

For most people in regular jobs that need some knowledge, the answer to how much time to spend on simple tasks is usually between 30 to 50 percent. People don’t like the idea of spending most of their time on easy work, so 50 percent feels like a natural limit. But if you go below 30 percent, your boss might worry you’re just thinking big ideas without actually getting things done, like not replying to emails.

Following this budget will probably mean you need to change how you work. You might have to say no to projects that seem pointless and cut down on the pointless stuff in your current projects. This budget could help you skip weekly meetings and focus more on results instead of just checking in all the time. You might also decide to spend more mornings working alone or realize that you don’t need to reply quickly to every email you get.

These changes are good for making deep work a bigger part of your job. They don’t ask you to completely ignore your regular tasks, which could cause issues, since you still need to do some of that work. But they do help you set a limit on how many less important tasks you let sneak into your schedule. This limit gives you more time for serious work regularly.

Starting this conversation with your boss is important because it helps you get support at work. If you have a boss, this plan gives you a reason to say no to extra tasks or change a project to make it less shallow. You can explain that it’s necessary to reach your target mix of work. As I mentioned earlier, one reason we end up doing too much shallow work is that we don’t see how it affects our time. We usually look at tasks one at a time, which makes each one seem okay. But the tools from earlier in this rule help you see the bigger picture. You can tell your boss, “This is how much time I spent last week on simple tasks,” and make them approve that amount. When they see the numbers and understand how wasteful it is to pay for too much shallow work, they’ll get it.
