Imagine your front entry mat is the starting point, and the first card is the King of Diamonds. You could picture Donald Trump cleaning mud off his fancy shoes on that mat.

As you move through each room, think of the right images that match the objects in the right order. After you finish a room, it might help to walk through it a few times to really remember what you saw. When you’re done, you can show your friend how you can name all the cards in order without looking. To do this, just take a mental walk through the rooms again, linking each memorable person or thing to its card as you think about it.

If you practice this method, you’ll find that, like many people who are good at remembering things, you can learn a whole deck of cards in just a few minutes. But more important than showing off to your friends is how this practice helps your brain. Following the steps requires you to focus on a clear goal over and over. This will make your ability to concentrate stronger, just like lifting weights builds muscle.

It’s important to note that memorizing cards isn’t anything special. Any activity that needs your full attention can help you in the same way. Whether it’s studying something difficult, meditating, or learning a guitar part by ear, you can pick something that works for you. The main idea is that your ability to focus gets better the more you work on it.
