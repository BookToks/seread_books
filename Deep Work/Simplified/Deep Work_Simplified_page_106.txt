Imagine your front entry mat is where you start, and the first card is the King of Diamonds. You might think of Donald Trump cleaning mud off his fancy shoes on that mat.

As you go through each room, connect the right images with the right objects in the right order. After finishing a room, it helps to walk through it a few times to remember everything. When you’re done, you can show off to a friend by naming all the cards in order without looking. To do this, just take another mental walk-through, linking each memorable person or thing to its card.

If you keep practicing this method, you’ll find that, like many memory champs before you, you can remember a whole deck in just a few minutes. But more important than impressing your friends is how this practice helps your brain. Following these steps makes you focus on a clear goal, which strengthens your ability to concentrate, just like lifting weights builds muscle.

It’s important to note that memorizing cards isn’t anything special. Any activity that needs your full attention can help you focus better, whether it’s studying something complex, practicing meditation, or learning a guitar part by ear. If card memorization feels odd to you, pick something else that challenges your brain in a similar way. The main idea is that your focus gets stronger the more you work on it.
