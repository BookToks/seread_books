Talent isn't something you can just buy a lot of and mix together to get the best results. Being the best comes with a special value. So, if you're in a place where everyone can see all the performers and knows their worth, they'll pick the top one. Even if the difference in talent between the best and the next best is small, the superstars still get most of the attention and success.

In the 1980s, a guy named Rosen looked at this idea using examples like movie stars and musicians. Back then, there were clear places like music stores and movie theaters where people could see different performers and figure out who was the best before they bought anything. Now, thanks to technology, many local markets have turned into global ones. A small company looking for a computer programmer or a public relations expert can now find talent from all over the world, just like how music fans could buy albums from famous bands instead of just local artists. Today, more people are competing with the top stars in their fields than ever before.

The last group that will do well in our new economy is made up of people like John Doerr, who have money to invest in new technologies that are changing everything. Having money gives you a big advantage. But some times are better for having cash than others. For example, after World War II, having a lot of money wasn’t great because inflation and high taxes could quickly ruin fortunes, which is sometimes called the “Downton Abbey Effect.”

Right now, during the Great Restructuring, it’s a really good time to have money. To understand why, think about how money is made when you mix capital investment with labor. Normally, the rewards are shared based on how much you put in. But as technology takes over jobs in many industries, the profits are increasingly going to those who own the smart machines. For instance, a venture capitalist today can invest in a company like Instagram, which later sold for a billion dollars.
