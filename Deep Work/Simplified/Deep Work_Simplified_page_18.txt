Talent isn't something you can just buy a lot of and mix together to get the best results. Being the best comes with a special value. So, if people can see all the performers available and know their skills, they'll pick the top ones. Even if the best talent is only a little better than the next best, the superstars still get most of the attention and business.

But some times are better for having cash than others. For example, after World War II, it wasn't a great time to have a lot of money because inflation and high taxes could quickly wipe out wealth, which we can think of as the "Downton Abbey Effect."

Normally, the rewards are shared based on how much you put in. But as digital technology reduces the need for workers in many jobs, the profits are increasingly going to those who own the smart machines. A venture capitalist today can invest in a company like Instagram, which later sold for a billion dollars, while
