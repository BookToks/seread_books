When someone asks me to do something that takes a lot of time, I try to say no without giving too many details. For example, if I get invited to speak somewhere but I have other trips planned, I just say, “Sounds interesting, but I can’t make it because of schedule conflicts.” I avoid offering to help in other ways that might take up more of my time, like saying, “Sorry I can’t join your committee, but I can look at your proposals and give my thoughts.” It’s better to just say no clearly.

I also pay a lot of attention to how I manage my time. Since I have a limited amount of time each day, I can’t let big deadlines sneak up on me or waste my mornings on unimportant stuff. I need to make a smart plan to stay on track. Having a set schedule helps me stay organized. Without that pressure, I might get lazy about my habits.

To sum it up, both Nagpal and I can do well in school without overloading ourselves for two main reasons. First, we focus on what’s really important and cut out the less important stuff. This way, we have more time to create valuable work without losing quality. I believe that cutting out the less important tasks actually gives us more energy to focus on the important ones, helping us get more done than if we just filled our schedules. Second, because we have limited time, we think more carefully about how we organize our work, which also helps us produce better results compared to longer but messier schedules.

The main point is that this method can work for anyone, not just professors. Even if you have a regular job, sticking to a fixed schedule can be really helpful. It’s easy to say yes to small commitments like grabbing coffee or jumping on a call, but when you commit to a fixed schedule, you start to see those as distractions. You begin to say no more often, making it harder for others to take up your time. This can even change how you think about your workplace culture, like realizing that it’s not normal to get emails from your boss after hours.
