It's really important to spend time with the people who matter to me, like having long talks, sharing meals, or doing fun activities together. I also want to help them out, even if it means making some sacrifices to make their lives better. Not everyone will have the same goals or activities, but I think this idea applies to a lot of people.

Now, let’s look at Facebook and how it fits into this idea. Facebook can help your social life in a few ways. It lets you catch up with friends you haven’t seen in a while, keep in touch with people you don’t see often, and see what’s going on in others' lives, like if they got married or had a baby. It can also help you find online groups that match your interests.

These are all good things about Facebook, but they don’t really help with the important stuff we talked about earlier, which usually happens in person and takes effort. So, the conclusion is that while Facebook has its perks, it might not be worth your time and attention if you really care about those key activities.

I’m not saying everyone should quit Facebook. I’m just saying that for some people, like a college freshman, making new friends might be more important than keeping up with old ones. For them, going to events and meeting new people might be their focus, and in that case, Facebook could really help.

Another example is a soldier deployed overseas. For them, staying in touch with family and friends back home is super important, and social networks might be the best way to do that. 

What these examples show is that this strategy can help people decide if they should keep using Facebook or Twitter based on their personal goals.
