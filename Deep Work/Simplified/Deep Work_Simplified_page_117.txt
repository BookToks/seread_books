important to me (like having a long talk, sharing a meal, or doing something together). 

2. I want to give my time and effort to the people who matter most to me (like making sacrifices that help their lives). 

Not everyone will have the same goals or activities, but many people can relate to this. Now, let’s look at Facebook and how it fits into this personal goal. Facebook has a lot of benefits for your social life. For example, it helps you catch up with friends you haven’t seen in a while, keep in touch with people you don’t see often, see important updates in people’s lives (like if they got married or had a baby), and find online groups that match your interests.

These are real benefits that Facebook offers, but they don’t really help with the two main activities we talked about, which are both offline and take effort. So, our strategy would lead to a surprising but clear conclusion: 

Yes, Facebook has benefits for your social life, but they aren’t important enough to make it worth your time and attention.

To be clear, I’m not saying everyone should stop using Facebook. I’m just saying that for this specific example, the strategy suggests that it might be better to stop using it. I can think of other situations where the opposite might be true. For example, a college freshman might want to make new friends more than keep in touch with old ones. This student might focus on going to events and meeting new people. In this case, using Facebook could really help them.

Another example is a soldier deployed overseas. For this soldier, staying in touch with friends and family back home is important, and social networks might be the best way to do that.

What’s clear from these examples is that this strategy, if used as described, might lead many people who currently use Facebook or Twitter to rethink their choices.
