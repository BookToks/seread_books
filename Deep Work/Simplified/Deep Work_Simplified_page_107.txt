Rule #3  
Quit Social Media  

In 2013, a guy named Baratunde Thurston, who writes about digital stuff, decided to try something different. He took a break from all social media for twenty-five days. That meant no Facebook, no Twitter, no Foursquare (a site where he was super popular), and not even checking his email. He really needed this break. Thurston, known as “the most connected man in the world” by his friends, had been super busy online, chatting over fifty-nine thousand times on Gmail and posting fifteen hundred times on Facebook just in the year before his experiment. He said, “I was burnt out. Fried. Done. Toast.”  

We know about Thurston’s experiment because he wrote about it in a magazine called Fast Company, with a funny title: “#UnPlug.” In the article, he shared that it didn’t take long for him to get used to not being online. By the end of the first week, he felt more relaxed and less stressed about missing out on news. He realized he could still enjoy life without posting everything online. He started talking to strangers and enjoyed meals without taking pictures for Instagram. He even bought a bike and found it easier to ride without checking Twitter at the same time. He said, “The end came too soon,” but he had work to do, so after twenty-five days, he went back online.  

Baratunde Thurston’s experiment shows two important things about how we use social media like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, as well as sites like Business Insider and BuzzFeed. First, we’re starting to see that these tools can break our focus and make it hard to concentrate. Everyone feels this way, and it’s a real problem, especially if you want to work better. In the last rule, I shared some tips to help you focus, but it gets a lot harder if you keep getting distracted by social media.
