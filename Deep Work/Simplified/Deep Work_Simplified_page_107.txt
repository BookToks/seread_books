Rule #3  
Quit Social Media  

In 2013, a guy named Baratunde Thurston, who writes about digital stuff, decided to try something different. He took a break from all social media for twenty-five days. That meant no Facebook, no Twitter, no Foursquare (which he had won an award for in 2011), and not even checking his email. He really needed this break. Thurston, who his friends say is super connected, had been in over fifty-nine thousand Gmail chats and posted fifteen hundred times on Facebook in the year before his experiment. He said, “I was burnt out. Fried. Done. Toast.”  

We know about Thurston’s experiment because he wrote about it in a magazine called Fast Company, with a funny title “#UnPlug.” He mentioned that it didn’t take long to get used to not being online. By the end of the first week, he felt way less stressed about missing out on things. He realized he could still be himself without posting everything online. He started talking to strangers, enjoyed meals without taking pictures for Instagram, and even bought a bike. He found it easier to ride without checking Twitter at the same time. He said, “The end came too soon,” but he had work to do, so after twenty-five days, he went back online.  

Baratunde Thurston’s experiment shows two important things about how we use social media like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, as well as sites like Business Insider and BuzzFeed. First, we’re starting to see that these tools break up our time and make it hard to focus. Everyone feels this way, and it’s a real issue for many people. This is especially true if you want to get better at concentrating. In the last rule, I shared some tips to help you focus better. But if you keep using social media, it will be much harder to stay focused.
