Thurston's Twitter use is about some tweets he made on March 13, 2014, from the account @Baratunde. He said, “Entertainment was my initial draw,” “When I first joined,” and “I use Facebook because.” These quotes come from comments I made in two blog posts I wrote in the fall of 2013. 

The first post is called “Why I’m (Still) Not Going to Join Facebook: Four Arguments That Failed to Convince Me.” You can check it out here: http://calnewport.com/blog/2013/10/03/why-im-still-not-going-to-join-facebook-four-arguments-that-failed-to-convince-me/. The second post is “Why I Never Joined Facebook.” Here’s the link: http://calnewport.com/blog/2013/09/18/why-i-never-joined-facebook/.

The Law of the Vital Few is about how to manage your internet habits. There’s a quote, “Who says my fans want to hear from me,” from a talk by Malcolm Gladwell at the International Digital Publishing Forum during the 2013 BookExpo America Convention in New York City. You can find a summary and some video clips from the talk in this article: “Malcolm Gladwell Attacks NYPL: ‘Luxury Condos Would Look Wonderful There,’” on Huffington Post, May 29, 2013. Here’s the link: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/29/malcolm-gladwell-attacks-_n_3355041.html. 

Another quote, “I don’t tweet,” and “It’s amazing how overly accessible,” comes from an interview with Michael Lewis. You can read it here: Allan, Nicole. “Michael Lewis: What I Read.” The Wire, March 1, 2010. http://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2010/03/michael-lewis-what-i-read/20129/. 

The quote, “And now, nearly a year later,” is from an article called “Why Twitter Will Endure,” by David Carr for the New York Times in January 2010. Check it out here: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/weekinreview/03carr.html. 

The phrase “Twitter is crack for media addicts” comes from an opinion piece for The New Yorker: Packer, George. “Stop the World.” The New Yorker, January 29, 2010. http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/georgepacker/2010/01/stop-the-world.html. 

The Law of the Vital Few is talked about in many places. Richard Koch’s book, The 80/20 Principle, published in 1998, helped bring this idea back into business. Tim Ferriss’s 2007 book, The 4-Hour Workweek, made it even more popular, especially among tech entrepreneurs. You can find a good summary of this idea on the Wikipedia page about the Pareto principle: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle. 

In the section about quitting social media, there’s a quote, “Everything’s more exciting when it’s a party,” and info about Ryan Nicodemus’s “packing party.” You can read about it here: “Day 3: Packing Party.” The Minimalists. http://www.theminimalists.com/21days/day3/. 

The average number of Twitter followers comes from an article titled “Average Twitter User Is an American Woman with an iPhone and 208 Followers,” published in the Telegraph on October 11, 2012. Here’s the link: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/9601327/Average-Twitter-user-is-an-an-American-woman-with-an-iPhone-and-208-followers.html. 

Keep in mind that this statistic might not be accurate. A few Twitter users have a lot of followers, which makes the average seem higher. The median number would probably be lower. Also, many users signed up just to check it out or read tweets and didn’t try to gain followers or tweet seriously. If we only looked at people who actually tweet and want followers, the numbers would be higher.
