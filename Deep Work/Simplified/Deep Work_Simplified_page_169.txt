The mention of Thurston’s Twitter use talks about tweets from March 13, 2014, from the account @Baratunde. He said, “Entertainment was my initial draw,” “When I first joined,” and “I use Facebook because.” These quotes come from comments on two blog posts I wrote in the fall of 2013. One is called “Why I’m (Still) Not Going to Join Facebook: Four Arguments That Failed to Convince Me,” and the other is “Why I Never Joined Facebook.”

The Law of the Vital Few can help you think about how you use the internet. A quote, “Who says my fans want to hear from me,” comes from a talk by Malcolm Gladwell at a big publishing event in New York in May 2013. You can find a summary of that talk and some video clips online. 

Another quote, “I don’t tweet,” comes from an interview with Michael Lewis. He also mentioned how crazy it is that we’re so accessible online. There’s a quote from David Carr in January 2010 saying, “And now, nearly a year later,” about Twitter’s lasting impact. 

The phrase “Twitter is crack for media addicts” is from an opinion piece in The New Yorker. The Law of the Vital Few is talked about in many places. Richard Koch’s book, The 80/20 Principle, helped bring this idea back into business talk. Tim Ferriss’s book, The 4-Hour Workweek, made it popular with tech entrepreneurs. You can find a good summary of this idea on Wikipedia.

In another section, there’s a mention of Ryan Nicodemus’s “packing party,” where he says, “Everything’s more exciting when it’s a party.” The average number of Twitter followers comes from a Telegraph article that says the average user is an American woman with an iPhone and 208 followers. But keep in mind that this number can be misleading because some users have huge followings that raise the average. If we only looked at people who actually tweet and want followers, the numbers would be higher.
