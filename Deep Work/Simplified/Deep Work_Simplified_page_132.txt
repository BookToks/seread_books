Things can definitely go wrong with your schedule as the day goes on. First, you might think something will take two hours, like writing a press release, but it actually takes two and a half hours. Second, you can get interrupted or new tasks can pop up unexpectedly, messing up your plans.

That’s totally fine. If your schedule gets messed up, just take a few minutes to make a new plan for the rest of the day when you can. You can start fresh on a new page, erase what you had, or just cross out the old blocks and create new ones next to them. I like to draw my blocks skinny so I can fit in a lot of changes. Some days, you might have to rewrite your schedule multiple times. Don’t worry if that happens. The goal isn’t to stick to a schedule no matter what; it’s to keep thinking about how you want to spend your time, even if you have to change your mind a lot throughout the day.

If you find yourself changing your schedule too much, there are some tricks to help you stay more stable. First, realize that you’re probably going to underestimate how much time you need for things at first. When people start scheduling, they often create a plan that’s too optimistic, thinking everything will go perfectly. Over time, try to get better at guessing how long tasks will really take.

Another helpful trick is to use overflow blocks. If you’re not sure how long something will take, block off the time you think it will need, then add another block just in case. If you need more time for the first task, you can use the extra block for that. But if you finish on time, you can use that block for something else, like catching up on emails. For example, if you plan two hours for writing a press release, you can add an extra hour block to keep working if you need it, or use it for emails if you finish early.

The last tip is to use lots of task blocks and make them longer than you think you’ll need. There are always surprises in a typical workday, so having extra time set aside helps you handle those unexpected things without constantly changing your schedule.
