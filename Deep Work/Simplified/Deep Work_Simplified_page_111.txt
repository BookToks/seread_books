The farm is moving away from traditional crops and focusing on a new idea called grass-finished meat. Instead of selling their steaks in stores like Whole Foods, they sell directly to customers at busy farmers’ markets around Washington, D.C. This farm is doing really well, even though it's hard for small farms to succeed in this industry.

I first met Pritchard at the farmers’ market in Takoma Park, Maryland, where his stand was popular. Pritchard is usually taller than most of his customers and wears the typical farmer's flannel shirt. He looks confident in what he does. I wanted to talk to him because farming needs careful use of tools, and I was curious about how he manages that.

“Making hay is a good example,” he said during our chat. “I can explain it without getting too complicated about money.” When Pritchard took over Smith Meadows, the farm made its own hay to feed the animals in winter when they can’t graze. Making hay uses a machine called a hay baler, which you pull behind a tractor to turn dried grass into bales. If you have animals on the East Coast, you need hay. Why buy feed when you can grow grass for free? A farmer might think it makes sense to buy a hay baler.

But Pritchard told me that if a farmer thought that way, “I’d be counting the days until the ‘For Sale’ sign goes up on the property.” Instead, he thinks more carefully about tools. After considering the hay baler, he decided to sell it and now buys all the hay they need.

Here’s why he made that choice… 

“Let’s look at the costs of making hay,” Pritchard said. “First, there’s the fuel, repairs, and the shed to store the baler. You also have to pay taxes on it.” These costs were straightforward, but the harder part was thinking about “opportunity costs.” He explained, “If I spend all summer making hay, I can’t do anything else. Now, I use that time to raise chickens for meat instead.”
