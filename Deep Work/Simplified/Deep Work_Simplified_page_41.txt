create important sources, gather facts, and write articles that really stand out. People like Alissa Rubin help give the Times its good name, and that good name helps the paper make money in a world full of tempting click-bait. So, why does Alissa have to stop her serious work to create simple content for a different media company in Silicon Valley, and why does this seem normal to so many? If we can figure this out, we’ll understand why deep work is becoming so rare.

One clue comes from Neil Postman, a communication expert and professor at NYU who passed away in 2003. In the early 1990s, when personal computers were becoming popular, he warned that society was starting to have a weird relationship with technology. He noticed that people stopped talking about the good and bad sides of new tech. Instead, if something was high-tech, people just assumed it was good. 

He called this kind of culture a technopoly and warned against it. He said, “Technopoly makes other options disappear without making them illegal or unpopular. It just makes them invisible and unimportant.” If Postman were alive today, he would probably be shocked at how quickly his worries came true, especially with the rise of the Internet. Luckily, there’s another thinker, Evgeny Morozov, who continues this discussion. In his 2013 book, To Save Everything, Click Here, Morozov talks about how we see “the Internet” as more than just technology. He says we treat it like a magical solution for everything, turning it into a big idea that shapes how we think about business and government.

Morozov points out that we now think of “the Internet” as the key to the future of companies and government. To make your business like “the Internet” is seen as being modern, while ignoring it makes you seem outdated. We forget that Internet tools are just products made by companies trying to make money.
