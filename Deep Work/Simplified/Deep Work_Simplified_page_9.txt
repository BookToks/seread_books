Benn had a plan, but he wasn't excited about the idea of staying home for a long time. He needed to learn a tough skill quickly.

Benn faced the same issue that stops many people from moving up in their careers. Learning something complicated like computer programming takes a lot of focus on hard ideas. This kind of focus is what made Carl Jung go to the woods near Lake Zurich. Basically, it’s called deep work. Unfortunately, many people today, including Benn, struggle with deep work.

“I was always on the Internet checking my email; I couldn’t help it; it was like an addiction,” Benn said about the time before he quit his finance job. He shared a story about a project his boss gave him. “They wanted me to write a business plan,” he explained. Since he didn’t know how to write one, he thought he’d read five different plans to learn what to do. It was a good plan, but Benn had a problem: “I couldn’t stay focused.” He admitted that there were days when he spent almost all his time—“98 percent of my time”—just surfing the Web. The business plan project, which could have helped him stand out early in his career, got ignored.

When he quit, Benn realized he had trouble with deep work. So, when he decided to learn coding, he knew he had to train his mind to focus better. His method was extreme but worked. “I locked myself in a room with no computer: just textbooks, notecards, and a highlighter.” He would highlight the programming books, write down the ideas on notecards, and then practice them out loud. At first, it was tough to stay away from distractions, but Benn had no choice: he had to learn. Eventually, he got better at concentrating and was able to spend five or more hours each day focused on learning this difficult skill. “I probably read about eighteen books on the topic by the time I was done,” he remembers.

After two months of studying hard, Benn went to the very challenging Dev Bootcamp, which was a super intense course in Web application programming. He even found a student with a PhD from Princeton who said Dev was “the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.”
