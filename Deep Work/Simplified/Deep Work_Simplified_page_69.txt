Isaacson was really organized. Whenever he found some free time, he would dive into writing his book. This is how he managed to write a huge nine-hundred-page book while also being one of the best magazine writers in the country.

I call this way of working the "journalist philosophy." It’s named this because journalists, like Walter Isaacson, are trained to switch into writing mode quickly, which is important because they often have tight deadlines.

But this method isn’t easy for beginners. As I mentioned earlier, switching your brain from easy tasks to deep work doesn’t happen automatically. If you don’t practice, it can really drain your energy. You also need to believe in yourself and think that what you’re doing matters and will work out. This belief usually comes from having some past successes. For example, Isaacson probably found it easier to switch to writing mode than a new novelist would because he had already built a reputation as a good writer. He was confident he could write a great biography, and he knew it was important for his career. This confidence helps a lot when you’re trying to work hard.

I really like the journalist philosophy for deep work because it’s how I fit my writing into my schedule. I’m not super strict about it, and I sometimes wish I could disconnect like my friend Donald Knuth does. I don’t do long writing sessions like some people do, and while I find the rhythmic approach interesting, my schedule often gets in the way of making it a daily habit. Instead, like Isaacson, I take each week as it comes and try to make the most of my time. For instance, to write this book, I used any free time I could find. If my kids were napping, I’d grab my laptop and work in my home office. If my wife wanted to visit her parents, I’d use that time to write in a quiet spot at their house. If a meeting got canceled, I’d head to my favorite library to write more. 

I should say that I don’t follow the journalist philosophy perfectly. I don’t decide exactly when I’ll work deeply on the spot. Instead, I usually plan out my deep work times for the week ahead.
