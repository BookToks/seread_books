Most nonfiction authors are easy to contact. They usually put an email address on their websites and invite readers to send them questions or suggestions. Many even say this feedback is important for building a community with their readers. But honestly, I don’t believe it.

If you check the contact page on my website, you won’t find a general email address. Instead, I list specific people you can reach out to for different reasons, like my literary agent for rights requests or my speaking agent for speaking gigs. If you want to contact me, I only give out a special email address for interesting offers or opportunities. You can email me at interesting [at] calnewport.com, but I’ll only reply to things that fit my schedule and interests.

I call this a sender filter because I want people to think carefully before contacting me. This method has really cut down the time I spend checking my emails. Before I used this filter, I had a regular email address on my site and got tons of long emails asking for advice on complicated student or career questions. I like helping people, but these requests became too much. They didn’t take long for the senders to write, but they needed a lot of time for me to answer. My sender filter has gotten rid of most of those emails, which means I see way fewer messages now. I focus my energy on helping a small number of student groups where I can really make a difference.

Another good thing about the sender filter is that it changes what people expect from me. The most important part of my message is that I’ll only reply to proposals that fit my schedule and interests. This might seem small, but it really changes how people think about their emails to me. Normally, people feel they have to respond to every email they get, especially if they’re not famous. This can create a lot of pressure when your inbox is full.

By changing what people expect, I can manage my time better and focus on what really matters to me.
