Most nonfiction authors are pretty easy to contact. They usually put an email address on their websites and invite readers to send them any questions or ideas. Many even say that this feedback is important for building a community with their readers. 

But I don’t believe it. 

If you check the contact page on my website, you won’t find a general email address. Instead, I list specific people you can reach out to for different reasons, like my literary agent for rights requests or my speaking agent for speaking gigs. If you want to get in touch with me, there’s only one special email address, and it has some rules: 

If you have an offer, opportunity, or introduction that could make my life more interesting, email me at interesting [at] calnewport.com. I’ll only reply to those messages that fit my schedule and interests.

I call this a sender filter because I’m asking people to think carefully before they contact me. This filter has really cut down the time I spend checking my emails. Before I used it, I had a regular email address on my site, and I got a ton of long emails asking for advice on complicated student or career questions. I like helping people, but those requests became too much. They didn’t take long for the senders to write, but they needed a lot of time and effort from me to respond. My sender filter has gotten rid of most of those emails, so I see way fewer messages in my inbox now. 

Now, I focus my energy on helping readers in ways that make a bigger impact. Instead of letting anyone send me a question, I work closely with a small number of student groups where I can be more available and provide better mentoring.

Another good thing about the sender filter is that it changes what people expect. The most important part of my message is: “I’ll only respond to those proposals that are a good match for my schedule and interests.” This might seem small, but it really changes how people think about their messages to me. Normally, people feel like they have to reply to every email they get unless they’re famous. So, having a lot of messages in your inbox can feel really overwhelming. 

By changing what people expect, I help them understand that I won’t always respond.
