Most nonfiction authors are pretty easy to contact. They usually put an email address on their websites and invite readers to send them questions or suggestions. Many even say they want this feedback to help build a community with their readers. 

But I don’t really believe that. 

If you check out the contact page on my website, you won’t find a general email address. Instead, I list specific people you can reach out to for different reasons, like my literary agent for rights requests or my speaking agent for speaking gigs. If you want to contact me, I only give out a special email address that comes with some rules and a lower chance that I’ll reply. If you have an offer or opportunity that might make my life more interesting, you can email me at interesting [at] calnewport.com. I’ll only respond to those messages that fit my schedule and interests.

I call this a sender filter because I’m asking people to think about whether their message is worth sending before they contact me. This filter has really cut down the time I spend checking my inbox. Before I used this filter, I had a regular email address on my site and got tons of long emails asking for advice on complicated student or career questions. I like helping people, but those requests became too much. They didn’t take long for the senders to write, but they required a lot of time for me to answer. My sender filter has gotten rid of most of those messages, which means I now deal with way fewer emails. Instead of letting anyone ask me a question, I focus my energy on a few student groups where I can be more helpful and provide better mentoring.

Another good thing about a sender filter is that it changes what people expect. The most important part of my message is this: “I’ll only respond to those proposals that are a good match for my schedule and interests.” This might seem small, but it really changes how people think about their messages to me. Normally, people feel like they have to reply to emails unless the sender is famous. So, having a full inbox can feel like a big responsibility. 

By changing what people expect, I can manage my time better and focus on what really matters to me.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** Nonfiction authors often invite readers to contact them, but the writer prefers a more selective approach. By using a sender filter, they reduce email volume and focus on meaningful interactions, helping specific student groups instead of responding to everyone. This method also changes expectations about replies.
