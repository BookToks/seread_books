Don't Use the Internet for Fun  
Think about a person in London who works a lot. They make a big mistake when they spend their free time just browsing the internet. Instead of using those sixteen hours to recharge, they waste their energy.  

People should enjoy the nice weather in summer. Jason Fried, who runs a company called Basecamp, decided to let his team work four days a week instead of five. This way, they can pack 40 hours of work into just four days. Some people think this idea doesn’t work, but Fried explains that many people don’t even work a full eight hours a day.  

Fried believes that having a four-day workweek is about working smarter, not harder. He even mentioned that he would prefer to have five days off in a row if he could. He also talked about how his company could afford to give everyone a month off.  

To make the most of your time, it’s important to plan every minute of your day. Research shows that people in Britain spend a lot of time online and watching TV. Some experts think we often underestimate how much we work.
