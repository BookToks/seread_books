Rule #1  
Work Deeply  

Not long after I met David Dewane for a drink at a bar in Dupont Circle, he started talking about something called the Eudaimonia Machine. David is an architecture professor, so he likes to think about how ideas and real things connect. The Eudaimonia Machine is a great example of this connection. It’s named after an old Greek idea called eudaimonia, which means reaching your full potential as a person. Basically, this machine is a building designed to help people do their best work. David told me, “The goal of the machine is to create a place where users can really thrive and create work that shows their true abilities.” So, it’s a space made just for deep work. I was really curious about it.  

As David explained the machine, he started drawing a sketch of how it would look. The building is a one-story rectangle with five rooms lined up in a row. There’s no hallway to walk through; you have to go from one room to the next. David said, “Not having a hallway is important because it makes sure you can’t skip any of the spaces as you go deeper into the machine.”  

The first room you enter from the street is called the gallery. In David’s plan, this room would show examples of the deep work done in the building. It’s meant to inspire people who use the machine, creating a vibe of “healthy stress and peer pressure.”  

After the gallery, you go into the salon. Here, David imagines having good coffee and maybe even a bar. There are couches and Wi-Fi too. The salon is meant to create a mood that’s a mix of curiosity and debate. It’s a place to discuss, think deeply, and work through ideas that you’ll explore more in the machine.  

Next, you enter the library. This room keeps a record of all the work done in the machine, along with the books and resources used for that work. There will be copiers and scanners to help gather and collect information.  

**PAGE SUMMARY:** The Eudaimonia Machine is a unique building designed to help people reach their full potential by creating an environment for deep work. It has five rooms, including a gallery for inspiration, a salon for discussion, and a library for resources.
