Rule #1  
Work Deeply  

Not long after I met David Dewane for a drink at a bar in Dupont Circle, he started talking about the Eudaimonia Machine. Dewane is a professor of architecture, so he likes to think about how ideas and real things connect. The Eudaimonia Machine is a cool example of this connection. It’s named after a Greek word that means reaching your full potential. It turns out that the machine is actually a building. “The goal of the machine,” David said, “is to create a place where people can really thrive and do their best work.” Basically, it’s designed to help people focus and do deep work. I was really interested in what he was saying.  

As Dewane explained the machine, he started sketching its layout. The building is a one-story, narrow rectangle with five rooms lined up in a row. There’s no hallway, so you have to go through one room to get to the next. Dewane said, “This is important because it means you can’t skip any of the spaces as you go deeper into the machine.”  

The first room you enter from the street is called the gallery. In Dewane’s plan, this room would show off examples of great work done in the building. It’s meant to inspire people and create a vibe of healthy stress and friendly competition.  

After the gallery, you move into the salon. Here, Dewane imagines having great coffee and maybe even a full bar. There are couches and Wi-Fi too. The salon is meant to create a mood that’s a mix of curiosity and debate. It’s a place to discuss ideas, think deeply, and work through thoughts that you’ll explore more in the machine.  

Next, you enter the library. This room keeps a record of all the work done in the machine, along with the books and resources used for that work. There will be copiers and scanners to help gather and collect information.
