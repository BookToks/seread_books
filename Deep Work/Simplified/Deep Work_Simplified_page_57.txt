Rule #1  
Work Deeply  

Not long after I met David Dewane for a drink at a bar in Dupont Circle, he started talking about the Eudaimonia Machine. David is an architecture professor, so he likes to think about how ideas and real things connect. The Eudaimonia Machine is a great example of this connection. It’s named after an old Greek idea called eudaimonia, which means reaching your full potential as a person. It turns out that the machine is actually a building. David explained, “The goal of the machine is to create a place where people can really thrive and do their best work.” In other words, it’s a space made just for doing deep work. I was really curious about it.  

As David talked about the machine, he grabbed a pen and started sketching how it would look. The building is a one-story rectangle with five rooms lined up in a row. There’s no hallway to walk through; you have to go through one room to get to the next. David said, “[The lack of circulation] is important because it makes sure you can’t skip any of the spaces as you go deeper into the machine.”  

The first room you enter from the street is called the gallery. In David’s plan, this room would show examples of deep work done in the building. It’s meant to inspire people who use the machine and create a vibe of “healthy stress and peer pressure.”  

After leaving the gallery, you go into the salon. In this room, David imagines having really good coffee and maybe even a full bar. There are also couches and Wi-Fi. The salon is designed to create a feeling that’s a mix of intense curiosity and debate. It’s a place to discuss ideas, think deeply, and work through the thoughts you’ll explore more in the machine.  

Next, you enter the library. This room keeps a permanent record of all the work done in the machine, along with the books and resources used for that work. There will be copiers and scanners for gathering and collecting the information.
