I usually don’t send emails after 5:30 p.m. But since emails are such a big part of work, there's something interesting about this: I don’t work after that time. I call this "fixed-schedule productivity." I set a clear goal not to work past a certain hour, and then I figure out how to be productive before that time. I've been doing this for over five years, and it really helps me focus on important work. I want to convince you to try this method too.

Let’s talk about why fixed-schedule productivity might seem like a bad idea, especially in the academic world where I work. Professors, especially new ones, often have super busy schedules that go late into the night and even on weekends. For example, a young computer science professor I’ll call “Tom” shared his schedule from a day in winter 2014. He spent twelve hours at his office, which included five meetings and three hours on boring tasks like answering emails and filling out forms. He figured he only spent an hour and a half actually doing real work that mattered. It’s no surprise that Tom feels he has to work way more than the usual hours. He even said he’s accepted that he’ll have to work on weekends because most new professors can’t escape that.

But I’ve managed to avoid that. Even though I don’t work at night and hardly ever on weekends, from when I started at Georgetown in 2011 until I began writing this chapter in 2014, I published about twenty articles that got peer-reviewed. I also won two competitive grants, published one book, and am almost done with another one (which you’re reading now). And I did all this without the crazy schedules that people like Tom think are necessary.

So, what’s the reason for this difference? A great answer comes from an article written in 2013 by Radhika Nagpal, a successful professor at Harvard. She says that a lot of the stress new professors feel is actually caused by themselves. There are many scary stories and data about what life is like for professors at research-focused universities.
