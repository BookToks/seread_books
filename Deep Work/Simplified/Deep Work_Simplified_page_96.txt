Write down the next time you can use the Internet. Until then, you can’t go online at all, no matter how tempting it is. 

The reason for this plan is that just using a distracting service doesn’t stop your brain from focusing. It’s actually the constant jumping from boring tasks to exciting ones that makes your brain unable to handle being bored or challenged. This jumping around is like making your brain weaker at focusing on what really matters. By limiting your Internet use, you’re reducing the chances of getting distracted, which helps your brain get better at focusing.

For example, if you know you can go online in thirty minutes and you start feeling bored, those thirty minutes become a workout for your focus. A whole day of planned distractions turns into a day of training your mind. 

Even though the idea is simple, it can be hard to do. Here are three important things to keep in mind. 

Point #1: This plan works even if your job needs you to be online a lot or answer emails quickly. If you have to be online for hours or respond to emails fast, that’s okay. It just means you’ll have more Internet breaks than someone with a less connected job. What matters is keeping your offline time strong.

For example, if you have two hours between meetings and need to check emails every fifteen minutes, that’s fine. You can schedule an Internet break every fifteen minutes, spending the rest of the time offline. In this case, you’ll be offline for about ninety minutes out of those two hours, which is a lot of practice for your focus without losing too much time online.
