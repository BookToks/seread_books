Write down the next time you can use the Internet. Until then, no Internet at all—no matter how tempting it is. 

The reason for this is that using distracting stuff doesn’t really stop your brain from focusing. It’s actually the constant jumping from boring stuff to exciting but not important stuff that makes your brain not able to handle being bored or challenged. This jumping around is like making your brain weaker when it comes to focusing on what really matters. By limiting your Internet use, you’re cutting down on distractions, which helps your brain get better at focusing.

For example, if you know you can go online in thirty minutes and you start feeling bored, those thirty minutes can be like a workout for your brain. A whole day of planned distractions can turn into a day of mental training.

Even though this idea is simple, actually doing it can be hard. Here are three important things to keep in mind.

First: This plan works even if your job needs you to be online a lot or reply to emails quickly. If you have to be online for hours or answer emails fast, that’s okay. It just means you’ll have more Internet breaks than someone who doesn’t need to be online as much. What matters is keeping your offline time strong.

For example, if you have two hours between meetings and need to check emails every fifteen minutes for about five minutes each time, you can plan to go online every fifteen minutes during that time. The rest can be offline. This way, you’ll spend around ninety minutes offline, training your brain to focus without losing too much time online.
