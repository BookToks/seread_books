In the 1920s, Jung was trying to break away from his mentor, Sigmund Freud. He started going to a simple stone house he built in the woods near a small town called Bollingen. Every morning, Jung would lock himself in a basic room to write without any interruptions. After writing, he would meditate and take walks in the woods to help clear his mind for the next day’s writing. I believe he did this to make his work stronger so he could compete with Freud and his followers.

It’s important to note that Jung didn’t live a totally isolated life while doing deep work. Unlike Donald Knuth and Neal Stephenson, who tried to cut out all distractions, Jung only did this during his time at the retreat. The rest of the time, he was busy in Zurich, where he saw patients late into the night, enjoyed the local coffeehouse scene, and gave lectures at well-known universities. Interestingly, Einstein, who studied and taught in Zurich, also knew Jung, and they had dinners together to talk about Einstein’s ideas.

Jung’s way of working is what I call the bimodal philosophy of deep work. This means you split your time between focused work and everything else. During the focused time, you aim for strong concentration and no distractions. When it’s time for everything else, you don’t need to focus as much. You can plan this on different scales. For example, you might spend a long weekend on deep work and use the rest of the time for other activities. Or, over a year, you could choose one season for deep work, like many teachers do during summer break.

The bimodal philosophy believes that deep work can lead to amazing productivity, but you need to spend enough time on it to reach a high level of focus where real breakthroughs happen. That’s why, in this philosophy, deep work usually needs to last at least a full day. Just a few hours in the morning isn’t enough to count as deep work for someone who follows this approach.
