Before I let you try out this strategy, I want to talk about a common concern. When I share the benefits of daily schedules, I often hear people say they’re afraid it will feel too strict. For instance, a reader named Joseph commented on a blog post I wrote about this. He said he thinks people might take scheduling too seriously and become obsessed with it. He worries that they might focus too much on counting every minute instead of enjoying their activities, especially artists who often need to be free to create.

I get where Joseph is coming from, and he’s not the only one who feels this way. Luckily, there’s an easy way to address these worries. In my own daily schedule, I make sure to set aside time for thinking and discussing ideas. I also have a rule: if I discover something important, I can ignore the rest of my schedule for the day, except for things I really can’t miss. I’ll dive into that new idea until I feel like I’ve explored it enough. After that, I can look at what time I have left and adjust my schedule.

So, I don’t just allow some flexibility in my schedule; I actually encourage it. Joseph’s concern comes from the wrong idea that a schedule is meant to box you in. But scheduling isn’t about being strict; it’s about being thoughtful. It’s a habit that helps you pause during the day and ask yourself, “What should I do with the time I have left?” It’s that habit of questioning that brings good results, not just sticking to a plan no matter what.

I’d even say that if you mix detailed scheduling with the ability to change your plans when needed, you’ll probably come up with more creative ideas than someone who just goes with the flow and keeps their day open. Without a plan, it’s easy to waste time on things like emails, social media, or just browsing the web. While these things might feel good at the moment, they don’t really help you be creative. With a schedule, you can make sure to set aside time to think about new ideas, tackle tough projects, or brainstorm for a while—these commitments are more likely to spark innovation.
