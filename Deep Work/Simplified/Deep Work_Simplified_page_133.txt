Before I let you try this strategy, I want to talk about a common worry. When I share the benefits of having a daily schedule, many people think it will feel too strict. For instance, a reader named Joseph commented on a blog I wrote about this. He said he worries that people might take scheduling too seriously, becoming obsessed with counting every minute instead of enjoying their activities. This is especially true for artists, who often need to get lost in their work.

I get these concerns, and Joseph isn’t the only one who feels this way. Luckily, it’s easy to address them. In my daily schedule, I make sure to set aside time for thinking and discussing ideas. I also have a rule: if I discover something important, I can ignore my schedule for the day, except for things I really can’t skip. I’ll focus on this new idea until I feel like I’ve explored it enough. Then, I’ll adjust my schedule for the rest of the day.

So, I don’t just allow spontaneity in my schedule; I actually encourage it. Joseph’s concern comes from the wrong idea that a schedule is meant to control you. But scheduling isn’t about being strict; it’s about being thoughtful. It’s a simple habit that helps you pause and ask yourself, “What should I do with the time I have left?” It’s this habit of questioning that leads to good results, not just sticking to a plan.

I’d even say that someone who combines a detailed schedule with the flexibility to change it will probably have more creative ideas than someone who keeps their day completely open. Without a plan, it’s easy to waste time on things like email, social media, or just browsing the web. While these things might feel good in the moment, they don’t help with creativity. With a schedule, you can make sure to set aside time to think about new ideas, tackle tough challenges, or brainstorm—activities that are more likely to spark innovation.
