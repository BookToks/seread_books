This strategy suggests that you should take some time away from work worries each day, like Kreider does, to help you focus better on important tasks. There are different ways to do this. One option is to completely escape from everyday tasks by going somewhere private, but that’s not realistic for most people. Instead, I recommend a simpler but still effective idea: at the end of your workday, stop thinking about work until the next morning. No checking emails after dinner, no replaying conversations in your head, and no planning how to tackle upcoming problems. Just let work thoughts go. If you need more time, you can work longer, but once you decide to stop, your mind should be free to enjoy other things.

Before I share some tips to help with this strategy, let’s look at why shutting down is good for your ability to create valuable work. We have Kreider’s personal experience to back this up, but it’s also important to understand the science behind why taking breaks is helpful. Research shows three main reasons why downtime is beneficial.

Reason #1: Downtime Helps You Think Better  
There’s a study from 2006 that talks about how taking a break can actually help you make better decisions. The researchers, led by Dutch psychologist Ap Dijksterhuis, wanted to show that sometimes it’s better to let your unconscious mind figure things out instead of trying to think hard about them. They found that if you gather information and then step away from it, your mind can work on it in the background. 

In their experiment, they gave people information about buying a car. One group was told to think carefully about the info before deciding. The other group did some easy puzzles after reading the information and then had to make a decision without thinking too much about it. The second group, who were distracted, actually made better choices.
