This strategy suggests that you should take a break from work worries during your day, just like Kreider does. This break is actually important for getting your best work done. There are different ways to do this. One way is to completely escape from all the little tasks by going to a quiet place, but that’s not realistic for most people.

Before I share some tips to help with this strategy, I want to explain why taking a break is good for your ability to create valuable work. We have Kreider’s personal experience to back this up, but it’s also important to look at the science that shows why downtime matters. Research gives us three reasons why taking breaks is beneficial.

Reason #1: Downtime Helps You Think Better
A study from 2006 published in the journal Science talks about how thinking hard about decisions isn’t always the best way to make them. The researchers, led by Dutch psychologist Ap Dijksterhuis, believed that sometimes it’s better to let your unconscious mind figure things out. This means that if you try too hard to solve a problem, you might actually make a worse choice than if you just gather the information and then distract yourself with something else while your mind works on it in the background.

Dijksterhuis’s team tested this idea by giving people information about buying a car. One group was told to think carefully about the information and make a decision. The other group did some easy puzzles after reading the info and then had to decide quickly without thinking too much. The distracted group...
