To build your work life around the feeling of flow that comes from doing deep work is a great way to find real happiness.

A Philosophical Argument for Depth

Now, let’s take a step back from the science stuff and think about this in a more philosophical way. I’ll refer to two smart guys who know a lot about this: Hubert Dreyfus, who taught philosophy at Berkeley for over 40 years, and Sean Dorrance Kelly, who is the head of Harvard’s philosophy department. In 2011, Dreyfus and Kelly wrote a book called *All Things Shining*, which talks about how ideas of what is sacred and meaningful have changed throughout human history. They wanted to look back at this history because they are worried about where we are now.

Dreyfus and Kelly say, “The world used to be full of sacred, shining things.” But now, those shining things feel really far away. So, what changed? According to them, the answer is Descartes. His ideas made people believe that the individual searching for certainty was more important than any God or king giving them the truth. This led to the Enlightenment, which brought about human rights and helped many people escape oppression. But Dreyfus and Kelly point out that while this was good politically, it took away the sense of order and sacredness that helps us find meaning in life. In today’s world, we have to figure out what’s meaningful ourselves, which can feel random and lead to feelings of emptiness. They worry that this focus on the individual can make life not just boring, but almost impossible to live.

At first, this might seem unrelated to our search for satisfaction in depth, but when we look at Dreyfus and Kelly’s solution, we’ll find new ideas about where meaning comes from in our work. This connection makes more sense when we see that their answer to modern emptiness is linked to the idea of craftsmanship.

Dreyfus and Kelly argue that craftsmanship can help us find a sense of sacredness again in a good way. To explain this,
