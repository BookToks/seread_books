To create a fulfilling work life, it's important to find a state called "flow," which comes from doing deep work. This idea is backed by research in psychology.

Now, let's talk about why depth in our lives matters. To understand this better, we need to look at things from a philosophical angle. Two experts in this area, Hubert Dreyfus and Sean Dorrance Kelly, have studied how our ideas about meaning and whatâ€™s important have changed over time. They wrote a book called *All Things Shining* in 2011, where they discuss how people used to see the world as filled with special, meaningful things. But now, they feel like those things are hard to find.

So, what changed? Dreyfus and Kelly say it all started with a thinker named Descartes. He believed that individuals searching for truth were more important than any higher power. This idea led to the Enlightenment, which brought about human rights and helped many people gain freedom. However, Dreyfus and Kelly point out that while this was good politically, it also took away the deeper meaning and order that help us find purpose in life. Now, we have to figure out what is meaningful on our own, which can feel random and lead to feelings of emptiness. They warn that this focus on individualism can make life feel dull and even unbearable.

At first, this might seem unrelated to our search for deep satisfaction, but Dreyfus and Kelly offer solutions that can help us find meaning in our work. Their answer connects back to something we talked about earlier: craftsmanship. They believe that being skilled at something can help us rediscover a sense of meaning and sacredness in a responsible way.
