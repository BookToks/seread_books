This study shows that spending time in nature can help you focus better. This idea, called attention restoration theory (ART), was first suggested in the 1980s by two psychologists from the University of Michigan, Rachel Kaplan and Stephen Kaplan. They believed that our ability to concentrate can get tired out, just like our willpower. When you run out of this ability, it’s hard to focus.

In a 2008 study, researchers found that walking in busy city areas makes you use a lot of your focus. You have to pay attention to things like when to cross the street safely or how to get around slow tourists. After about fifty minutes of this, people felt mentally drained.

On the other hand, walking in nature gives you a break. Marc Berman, the lead author of the study, says that nature has “inherently fascinating stimuli,” like beautiful sunsets. These things don’t require much effort to pay attention to, which helps your mind relax and recharge. After fifty minutes of walking in nature, people found it easier to concentrate.

Some might think that being outside and enjoying a sunset just makes people happy, and that happiness helps them focus. But the researchers tested this idea in the cold winter of Ann Arbor. Even though the cold didn’t make people feel good, they still did better on concentration tasks.

What’s important here is that ART shows how you can regain your focus by taking breaks. Nature helps, but other relaxing activities can do the same thing. Whether it’s chatting with a friend, listening to music while cooking, playing games, or going for a run, these activities can help you recharge your focus after a long day.
