During my college years, I shared an office with a super-smart professor who won a big award called the MacArthur “genius grant.” He got hired at MIT when he was really young, even before he could legally drink. It was common to see him in the common area, staring at a whiteboard with a bunch of other scholars quietly watching him. This could go on for hours. I’d go to lunch and come back, and he’d still be staring. He’s hard to get in touch with because he’s not on Twitter, and if he doesn’t know you, he probably won’t reply to your email. Last year, he published sixteen papers.

This kind of intense focus was everywhere during my student years. Because of that, I started to focus deeply too. My friends and the publicists I’ve worked with on my books were not happy about it, but I’ve never had a Facebook or Twitter account, or any social media besides a blog. I don’t browse the internet much and get most of my news from the Washington Post and NPR. I’m also tough to reach: my author website doesn’t have a personal email, and I didn’t get my first smartphone until 2012 when my pregnant wife told me I needed one before our son was born.

On the bright side, my focus has paid off. In the ten years after I graduated, I published four books, got a PhD, wrote a lot of academic papers, and became a professor at Georgetown University. I managed to do all this while usually finishing work by five or six p.m. during the week.

I can keep this busy schedule because I work hard to avoid distractions and make the most of my time. I plan my days around important deep work and only do the necessary shallow tasks in small chunks. Spending three to four hours a day, five days a week, on focused work can lead to a lot of great results.

My focus on depth has also helped me outside of work. Usually, I don’t use a computer after I get home until the next morning (except for writing blog posts after my kids go to bed). Being able to disconnect completely, instead of checking emails or social media all the time, lets me be present with my family.
