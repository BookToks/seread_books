personalized information comes at random times, making it super addictive. This can really mess up your ability to focus and get things done. You might think that people who need to concentrate, like programmers or writers, would stay away from these tools. But social media is tricky because the companies behind it have done a great job convincing everyone that if you don’t use their stuff, you’ll miss out on something important.

This fear of missing out is similar to Nicodemus worrying that all the junk in his closets might be useful someday. That’s why I suggest trying something different, like taking a month off from social media. This way, you can replace that fear of missing out on events or conversations with the truth. For most people, this truth becomes clear after they step back from all the ads and messages: social media isn’t as important as you think.

I recommend not telling anyone about your thirty-day break because some people believe others really care about what they post. They think people will be upset if they suddenly stop sharing their thoughts. I’m being a bit sarcastic, but this feeling is real and needs to be addressed. For instance, the average Twitter user has about 208 followers. When you see that over two hundred people want to hear from you, it’s easy to think your posts matter a lot. Trust me, I know this feeling well since I try to sell my ideas for a living!

But here’s the truth about social media audiences. Before these platforms existed, building a following beyond your friends and family took a lot of hard work. Back in the early 2000s, anyone could start a blog, but getting even a few visitors required effort to create interesting content. I remember starting my first blog in 2003, called Inspiring Moniker, where I wrote about my life as a college student. Honestly, there were times when no one read it at all! Over the next decade, I slowly built an audience for my writing.
