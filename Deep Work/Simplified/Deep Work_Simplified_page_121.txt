Social media gives us personalized information at random times, which makes it super addictive. This can really mess up your ability to focus and get things done. You’d think that people whose jobs depend on deep thinking, like programmers or writers, would stay away from these distractions. But the companies that make social media have done a great job convincing us that if we don’t use their products, we might miss out on something important.

This fear of missing out is similar to how Nicodemus felt about the stuff he kept in his closets, thinking it might be useful someday. That’s why I suggest trying something like his packing party. If you spend a month without social media, you can see that missing out on events or conversations isn’t as big of a deal as you think. Most people will realize, after taking a break, that social media isn’t really that important in their lives.

I recommend not telling anyone about your thirty-day break because some people think others care about what they say online. They worry that if they stop posting, people will be disappointed. This feeling is common and needs to be addressed. For example, the average Twitter user has about 208 followers. When you see that many people want to hear from you, it’s easy to feel like your posts matter. I get it; it’s a really addictive feeling!

But here’s the truth about social media audiences. Before these platforms existed, building an audience took real effort. Back in the early 2000s, starting a blog was easy, but getting even a few visitors required hard work to share valuable information. I know this from experience. I started my first blog in 2003, called Inspiring Moniker, where I wrote about my life as a college student. There were times when no one read it at all. Over the years, I learned how to slowly build an audience.
