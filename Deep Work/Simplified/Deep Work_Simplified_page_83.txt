tangible results. Second, it helped me understand how many hours of focused work I needed for each result. This reality (which was more than I first thought) motivated me to fit more focused hours into my week.

Discipline #4: Create a Rhythm of Accountability

The authors of 4DX explain that the last step to keep focusing on important goals is to have regular meetings with any team that has a big goal. During these meetings, team members need to check their progress, promise to take specific actions to improve before the next meeting, and talk about what happened with their promises from the last meeting. They say these reviews can be quick, but they need to happen regularly to make a difference. The authors believe this is where real progress happens.

If you’re working on your own deep work habits, you might not have a team to meet with, but you still need regular accountability. In different parts of this book, I talk about doing a weekly review where you plan for the upcoming week (see Rule #4). When I tried out 4DX, I used my weekly review to check my progress, celebrate good weeks, understand what caused bad weeks, and most importantly, figure out how to keep doing well in the future. This helped me change my schedule to fit my goals, allowing me to do much more deep work than if I hadn’t done these reviews.

The 4DX framework is based on the idea that actually getting things done is harder than just planning. After looking at many case studies, the creators found a few key habits that work really well for overcoming this challenge. So, it makes sense that these habits can also help you build your own deep work routine.

To wrap it up, let’s go back to my own story. As I mentioned before, when I first started using 4DX, I set a goal to publish five peer-reviewed papers in the 2013–2014 school year. This was a big goal since I had only published four papers the year before (which I was proud of). During my 4DX experiment, the clarity of this goal, along with the simple feedback from my progress scoreboard, pushed me to work deeper than I ever had before. Looking back, it wasn’t just the intensity of my deep work sessions that increased, but how often I did them. I used to save my deep work for just a few times, but now I was doing it regularly.
