Seeing real results is important. It helped me understand how many hours of focused work I needed to get those results. This made me want to fit more focused work into my week.

Discipline #4: Create a Rhythm of Accountability  
The authors of 4DX explain that the last step to stay focused on important goals is to have regular meetings with your team. In these meetings, everyone looks at their progress, promises to take specific actions to improve before the next meeting, and discusses what happened with their previous promises. These meetings can be quick, but they need to happen often to really make a difference. The authors believe this is where real work gets done.

If you’re working on your own deep work habits, you might not have a team to meet with, but you still need to hold yourself accountable. In this book, I talk about doing a weekly review where you plan for the week ahead. When I tried 4DX, I used my weekly review to check my progress, celebrate good weeks, figure out why some weeks were tough, and plan for better days ahead. This helped me change my schedule to fit my goals, allowing me to do much more focused work than if I hadn’t done those reviews.

The 4DX framework is based on the idea that getting things done is harder than just making plans. After studying many cases, the creators found a few key habits that really help with this challenge. It makes sense that these same habits can also help you build your own deep work routine.

To wrap it up, let’s go back to my own story. When I first started using 4DX, I aimed to publish five research papers in the 2013-2014 school year. This was a big goal since I had only published four papers the year before, which I was proud of. During my 4DX journey, having a clear goal and regular feedback from my progress pushed me to work deeper than I had before. Looking back, it wasn’t just about working harder; it was about working consistently. Instead of cramming my deep work into short bursts, I learned to make it a regular part of my routine.
