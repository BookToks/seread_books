decisions about where certain tasks fit on a scale from easy to hard. To figure this out, you can ask a simple question: 

How long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no special training in my field to do this task?

Let’s look at some examples to see how this works.

**Analyzing Example #1:**  
Editing an academic paper is tough. You need to understand the details of the work to make sure everything is described correctly. You also need to know the broader literature to make sure it’s cited right. This requires a lot of knowledge, which takes years of study in school. So, for this task, it might take about fifty to seventy-five months to train someone.

**Analyzing Example #2:**  
The second example isn’t as complicated. Making a PowerPoint presentation about your sales requires three things: knowing how to use PowerPoint, understanding the usual format for these presentations at your company, and knowing what sales data to include and how to show it in graphs. A smart college grad would likely already know how to use PowerPoint, and learning the format shouldn’t take more than a week. The main challenge is understanding the sales metrics and how to present them, which might take about two months of training.

**Analyzing Example #3:**  
Meetings can be hard to judge. They might seem boring, but they are often important for your organization. To see how long it would take to train a recent college grad to take your place in a planning meeting, they would need to understand the project and the skills of the team members involved. 

**PAGE SUMMARY:** This passage explains how to evaluate tasks based on how long it would take to train a new college graduate to do them. It uses examples like editing academic papers, creating PowerPoint presentations, and participating in meetings to show the differences in training time needed for each task.
