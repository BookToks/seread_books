Massachusetts Avenue Bridge. After a quick lunch and shower at home, I usually took the subway across the river to get back to campus. This saved me about a third of a mile on my walk home after work. Basically, I spent a lot of time on my feet during this time. This is what made me start doing something I think you should try too: productive meditation.

The idea of productive meditation is to use times when your body is busy but your mind isn’t—like walking, jogging, driving, or showering—to focus on one specific work problem. Depending on what you do, this could be planning an article, preparing a speech, solving a tricky math problem, or figuring out a business plan. Just like in regular meditation, you need to keep bringing your mind back to the problem if it starts to wander.

I used to practice productive meditation during my daily walks across the river when I lived in Boston. As I got better at it, my results improved too. For instance, I figured out chapter outlines for a big part of my last book while walking, and I made progress on tough problems in my research.

I think you should try productive meditation in your life. You don’t need to do it every day, but aim for at least two or three sessions a week. The good news is that it’s easy to find time for this since it uses moments that would usually be wasted, like walking the dog or commuting. If done right, it can actually make you more productive without taking away from your work. You might even want to plan a walk during your workday just to focus on a big problem you need to solve.

But I’m not just suggesting this for the productivity boost (though that’s a nice bonus). I’m more interested in how it can help you think better and deeper. From my experience, productive meditation helps with the two main ideas I talked about at the start. By making you fight distractions and keep focusing on one problem, it strengthens your ability to resist distractions and improves your concentration.

To really get good at productive meditation, remember that, like any type of meditation, it takes practice. When I first tried this method, I struggled a bit. 

**PAGE SUMMARY:** Productive meditation is a technique where you focus on a work problem while doing physical activities. It helps improve your thinking and concentration. You can practice it a few times a week during moments like walking or commuting, making it easy to fit into your routine.
