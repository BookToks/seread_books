Carl Jung became one of the most important thinkers of the 1900s. There are many reasons for his success, but in this book, I want to focus on one important skill that helped him a lot: 

Deep Work. 

This means doing professional tasks without distractions, really focusing, and pushing your brain to its limits. This kind of work creates new ideas, improves your skills, and is hard for others to copy. 

Deep work is essential to get the most out of your brain. Research in psychology and neuroscience shows that the mental effort involved in deep work is also necessary to get better at what you do. In simple terms, deep work was exactly what Jung needed to stand out in a tough field like psychiatry in the early 1900s. 

The term "deep work" is something I came up with, not Jung, but his actions showed he understood the idea. He built a stone tower in the woods to help him focus on his work. This took a lot of time, energy, and money, and it meant he had to give up some other things. Mason Currey noted that Jung often took trips to his tower, which meant he spent less time with his patients. Even though he had many people depending on him, Jung wasn't afraid to take breaks. Deep work was hard to prioritize, but it was essential for his goal of making a difference in the world. 

If you look at the lives of other important people from history, you’ll see that deep work is a common theme. For example, the writer Michel de Montaigne worked in a private library he built in his French château. Mark Twain wrote much of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer in a shed far from his house, where his family had to blow a horn to call him for meals. 

Looking at more recent history, screenwriter and director Woody Allen wrote and directed 44 films between 1969 and 2013, earning 23 Academy Award nominations. He did this without a computer, using a manual typewriter instead, so he could work without distractions. Peter Higgs, a physicist, also avoids computers to stay focused on his work. 

**PAGE SUMMARY:** Carl Jung's success was largely due to his commitment to "deep work," which means focusing without distractions. Many influential figures, like Mark Twain and Woody Allen, also prioritized deep work to achieve their goals.
