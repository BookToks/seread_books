Brattain and Bardeen worked together, helping each other create better designs. They did a special kind of focused work that we haven't really seen before. Brattain would focus hard on making a new design based on Bardeen's latest ideas. Then, Bardeen would focus on understanding what Brattain's experiments showed, trying to adjust his theories to fit the new findings. This teamwork is a kind of deep work that’s common in schools and research. When you work with someone else, like at a shared whiteboard, it can help you think deeper than if you were alone. Having someone there waiting for your next idea can push you to think more deeply.

Now, let’s look at what we can learn about teamwork and deep work. The success of places like Building 20 and Bell Labs shows that you don’t have to work alone to be productive. In fact, working together can lead to better results, especially when trying to come up with new ideas. So, when you think about how to include deep work in your life, remember these two tips.

First, distractions can ruin your focus. So, it’s important to keep your random meetings separate from your deep thinking time. Try to work on each one separately instead of mixing them up, which can mess up both.

Second, even when you take time to think deeply, don’t hesitate to use the whiteboard effect when it makes sense. Working closely with someone can help both of you think deeper and create better results than if you were working alone. So, when you’re doing deep work, think about collaborating when it’s right, but also remember that you need uninterrupted focus to really make sense of all the ideas around you.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** Brattain and Bardeen showed how working together can improve deep thinking and creativity. Teamwork can lead to better results, but it’s important to manage distractions and balance collaboration with focused thinking.
