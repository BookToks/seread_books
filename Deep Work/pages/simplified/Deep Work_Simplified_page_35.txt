Business culture can be confusing, especially when we look at things like big salaries that make people wonder why they exist. Without clear ways to measure success, businesses can easily get distracted and lose focus on what really matters. This chapter will explain how certain mindsets and biases have pushed companies away from deep work and towards distractions. If it was obvious that these distractions were bad for business, they wouldn’t last long, but the lack of clear metrics makes it hard to see the damage they cause.

One major distraction in the workplace is the constant need to stay connected. People feel they have to quickly read and reply to emails and messages. Research from Harvard Business School professor Leslie Perlow shows that many professionals spend about twenty to twenty-five hours a week outside of work just checking emails, thinking they need to respond within an hour.

Some might say this is necessary for fast-paced jobs, but Perlow wanted to find out if that was true. She worked with a team at the Boston Consulting Group, a busy consulting firm, to test this idea. She made everyone take one day off each week where they couldn’t connect with anyone at work. At first, the team was worried about how this would affect their jobs and clients. But surprisingly, they didn’t lose any clients or jobs. Instead, they enjoyed their work more, communicated better, and learned more from each other.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** This passage discusses how distractions in business, like constant connectivity, can hurt deep work. Research shows that taking breaks from emails can improve job satisfaction and teamwork without losing clients or jobs.
