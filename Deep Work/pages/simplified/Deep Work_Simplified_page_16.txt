The first type of answers to this question looks at the personal traits and strategies that helped a few people succeed. The second type focuses more on the big picture, looking at the kind of work these people represent. Both types of answers are important, but the big picture answers are more relevant to our discussion because they show what our economy currently rewards.

To understand this big picture, we can look at two MIT economists, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee. In their important 2011 book, *Race Against the Machine*, they argue that digital technology is changing our job market in surprising ways. They say, “We are in the early stages of a Great Restructuring.” This means that while technology is advancing quickly, many people's skills and job structures are not keeping up. For many workers, this is bad news. As machines get smarter and can do more jobs, companies are more likely to hire machines instead of people. When they do need a human, technology is making it easier to work remotely, so companies might hire top talent from anywhere, leaving local workers without jobs.

But it’s not all bad news. Brynjolfsson and McAfee point out that this Great Restructuring is not just about losing jobs; it’s also creating a divide. While some people will lose their jobs because their skills can be automated or outsourced, others will not only keep their jobs but will also be more valued and rewarded than before. Brynjolfsson and McAfee are not the only ones who think this way. In 2013, economist Tyler Cowen wrote a book called *Average Is Over*, which shares similar ideas about this divide in the economy. What makes Brynjolfsson and McAfee’s analysis especially helpful is that they identify three specific groups of people who will benefit the most in this new age of intelligent machines. Not surprisingly, these groups include people like Nate Silver, who is one of the high-skilled workers.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how digital technology is changing the job market, creating a divide between those who thrive and those who struggle. While some jobs are lost, others become more valuable, especially for high-skilled workers.
