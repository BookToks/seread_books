Your situation is a lot like Jung trying to outsmart Freud or Jason Benn trying to keep up in a fast-paced start-up. To really succeed, you need to create the best work you can, and that takes serious focus.

Deep work is becoming more important now. Back in the industrial days, only a few skilled workers needed to concentrate deeply, while most people could do their jobs without really focusing. They were just making things and their jobs didn’t change much over time. But now, as we move into an information-based economy, more people are knowledge workers, and deep work is becoming super important—even if many don’t realize it yet.

Deep work isn’t just an old skill that’s fading away. It’s actually a key ability for anyone who wants to get ahead in a competitive job market that can easily push out those who aren’t performing well. The real rewards go to those who can create new systems and ideas, not just those who can scroll through social media. Deep work is so crucial that some people call it “the superpower of the 21st century.”

We’ve looked at two ideas: one is that deep work is getting rarer, and the other is that it’s becoming more valuable. This leads us to the main idea of the book: The Deep Work Hypothesis. It says that being able to do deep work is becoming less common at the same time it’s becoming more important. So, those who develop this skill and make it a big part of their work life will do really well.

This book has two main goals. The first part will show you that the deep work hypothesis is true. The second part will teach you how to benefit from this by training your brain and changing your work habits to focus on deep work. Before we get into those details, I want to share how I became so passionate about deep work.

For the last ten years, I’ve been working on my ability to concentrate on tough tasks. To understand why this matters to me, it helps to know that I’m a theoretical computer scientist who trained at MIT’s famous Theory of Computation group, where focusing deeply is super important.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses the importance of deep work in today's information economy. It highlights how deep work is becoming rare yet valuable, and those who master it will succeed. The book aims to prove this idea and teach readers how to develop their focus and work habits.
