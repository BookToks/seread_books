Conclusion

The story of how Microsoft started is so famous that it feels like a legend. In the winter of 1974, a young Harvard student named Bill Gates saw the Altair, the first personal computer, on the cover of Popular Electronics. Gates realized he could create software for it, so he dropped everything. With help from Paul Allen and Monte Davidoff, he spent the next eight weeks putting together a version of the BASIC programming language for the Altair. This story shows Gates’s smart thinking and bravery, but recent interviews have highlighted another important quality: his amazing ability to focus deeply.

As Walter Isaacson explained in a 2013 article for the Harvard Gazette, Gates worked so hard during those two months that he would often fall asleep at his keyboard while writing code. He would sleep for an hour or two, then wake up and continue right where he left off. Paul Allen described this as “a prodigious feat of concentration.” In his book The Innovators, Isaacson noted that Gates’s main difference from Allen was his focus. While Allen jumped between many ideas, Gates was obsessed with one thing at a time.

This story about Gates’s intense focus supports my argument for deep work. In our fast-changing world, it’s easy to complain about how distracted we are. Some people worry about how much time we spend on our phones and miss the days when we could concentrate without interruptions. Others think that being connected is the key to a better future. Marshall McLuhan said, “the medium is the message,” but today’s discussions seem to suggest that “the medium is morality”—you either support the Facebook future or think it’s ruining us.

As I mentioned in the introduction of this book, I’m not interested in this debate. Committing to deep work isn’t about morals or philosophy; it’s a practical way to recognize that being able to focus is a skill that helps us achieve important things. Deep work matters not because distractions are bad, but because it helped Bill Gates create a billion-dollar industry in less than a year.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how Bill Gates founded Microsoft by focusing intensely on creating software for the first personal computer, the Altair. It highlights the importance of deep work and concentration in achieving success, contrasting it with modern distractions and debates about technology.
