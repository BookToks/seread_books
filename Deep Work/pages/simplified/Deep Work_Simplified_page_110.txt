You have a good reason to use a network tool if you can see any possible benefit from it or think about what you might miss out on if you don’t use it. 

But there’s a problem with this way of thinking. It ignores the downsides that come with these tools. These services are designed to be super addictive, taking away your time and focus from things that really help you reach your personal and professional goals, like doing deep work. If you use these tools too much, you might end up feeling burned out and constantly distracted, just like Baratunde Thurston and many others. This shows how dangerous the “any-benefit” mindset can be. Using network tools can actually be harmful. If you only look at the potential benefits and ignore the negatives, you might hurt your chances of succeeding in your work.

This idea shouldn’t be surprising. We’ve gotten used to the “any-benefit” mindset with network tools, but if we think about it in a bigger picture, it seems strange. When you forget the hype around the Internet and realize that network tools are just tools—like a blacksmith’s hammer or an artist’s brush—you see they’re meant to help skilled workers do their jobs better. Throughout history, skilled workers have been careful and thoughtful about new tools before deciding to use them. There’s no reason why knowledge workers can’t do the same with the Internet. Just because the work involves digital stuff doesn’t change that fact.

To understand how to choose tools more carefully, it helps to look at someone who works with non-digital tools and relies on them to succeed. I found a great example in Forrest Pritchard, a tall English major who became a successful sustainable farmer. He runs Smith Meadows, a family farm about an hour from D.C., in the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains. After taking over the farm from his parents, Pritchard made some important changes to how the farm operates.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses the risks of using network tools without considering their downsides. It highlights the importance of careful tool selection, comparing digital tools to traditional ones. The example of Forrest Pritchard, a farmer, illustrates the thoughtful approach to using tools for success.
