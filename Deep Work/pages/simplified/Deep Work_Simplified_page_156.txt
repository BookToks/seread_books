Introduction

In my quiet space, I keep the key and feel relaxed and refreshed. This is from Carl Jung's book, *Memories, Dreams, Reflections*, translated by Richard Winston.

Jung had many patients, and there’s info about how artists work from Mason Currey’s book, *Daily Rituals: How Artists Work*.

The timeline of Jung’s life and work helped me understand how important deep work was for him. You can find more about Jung from Charles Cowgill’s article online.

Anders Ericsson from Florida State University studies deliberate practice. He has a good explanation on his academic website.

I gathered the deep work habits of famous people from these sources:

- Mark Twain's habits come from Mason Currey’s *Daily Rituals*.
- Woody Allen's habits are discussed in Robert Weide’s 2011 documentary, *Woody Allen: A Documentary*.
- Peter Higgs’s info is from Ian Sample’s article in *The Guardian*.
- J.K. Rowling’s habits can be found on her Twitter.
- Bill Gates’s habits are from Robert Guth’s article in the *Wall Street Journal*.
- Neal Stephenson’s habits are from an old version of his website saved by The Internet Archive.

A 2012 study by McKinsey found that social technology can unlock value and productivity.

Nicholas Carr discusses how the internet affects our thinking in his article, “Is Google Making Us Stupid?” in *The Atlantic Monthly*. He even had to go to a cabin to finish his book, *The Shallows*.

Eric Barker calls focus the “superpower of the 21st century” in his article on increasing attention spans.
