When you start a project through an email, it sticks in your mind. It’s like having something on your to-do list that you know you need to deal with later. Closing this “loop” means taking care of it right away. By writing down tasks and keeping the other person updated, you free up your mind from worrying about it. Less mental clutter helps you think better.

At first, sending emails this way might feel weird. It means you have to spend more time thinking about what you want to say before you write it. It might seem like you’re wasting time, but those extra minutes can save you a lot of time later by cutting down on back-and-forth emails.

Also, emails that focus on processes can feel stiff and too formal. Most people prefer a friendly chatty style in emails, which doesn’t always match the more organized way of writing. If you’re worried about this, try starting with a friendly intro before getting into the details. You can even label the more formal part as “Next Steps” to make it fit better.

In the end, these small changes are worth it. By thinking more about what you really want to say in your emails, you can make your work life easier and focus on what really matters.

Tip #3: Don’t Always Reply

When I was a grad student at MIT, I noticed that many smart professors had a unique way of handling emails: they often didn’t reply right away. I learned that they believed it was the sender’s job to show why a reply was important. If you didn’t make a strong case and keep it easy for them to respond, they wouldn’t reply.

For example, if you sent a basic email without enough details, many professors might not respond at all.
