  "text": "A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS             \n7  \nNana used to be one of the housekeepers. Then she got pregnant.  \n\nWhen that happened, everyone in Jalil's family gasped like the air had been sucked out of Herat. His in-laws threatened chaos. The wives insisted he kick her out. Nana's dad, a lowly stone carver from the nearby village of Gul Daman, disowned her. He packed up and took a bus to Bran, disappearing for good.  \n\n\"Sometimes,\" Nana said one morning while feeding the chickens outside their kolba (tiny house), \"I wish my dad had the guts to sharpen one of his knives and do the honorable thing. It might've been better for me.\" She tossed more seeds into the coop, paused, and looked at Mariam. \"Maybe it would’ve spared you the pain of knowing who you are. But he was a coward, my father. No dil (heart) for it.\"  \n\nJalil didn’t have the dil either, Nana said. He didn’t stand up to his family or take responsibility for what he did. Instead, behind closed doors, they struck a face-saving deal. The next day, he made her pack her few things from the servants' quarters and sent her away.  \n\n\"You know what he told his wives to justify it? That I forced myself on him. That it was my fault. Didi? This is what it means to be a woman in this world.\"  \n\nNana set down the bowl of chicken feed and lifted Mariam's chin with her finger.  \n\n\"Look at me, Mariam.\"  \n\nReluctantly, Mariam did.  \n\nNana said, \"Learn this now and learn it well, my daughter: Like a compass needle that points north, a man's accusing finger always finds a woman. Always. Remember that, Mariam.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Nana teaches Mariam that in their world, women are often blamed for men's actions and suffer the consequences of male cowardice."
