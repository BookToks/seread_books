  "text": "A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS             \n7 \n\nNana used to be one of the housekeepers. But everything changed when she got pregnant. ðŸ˜³ When that happened, Jalil's family gasped so loud it felt like they sucked all the air out of Herat. His in-laws were furious and demanded he kick her out. Even Nana's dad, a simple stone carver from Gul Daman, disowned her. He packed his stuff and took a bus to Bran, never to return. \n\n\"Sometimes,\" Nana said one morning while feeding the chickens outside their kolba, \"I wish my dad had the guts to sharpen his knife and do the right thing. It might have been better for me.\" She tossed more seeds into the coop, paused, and looked at Mariam. \"Maybe it would have been better for you too. You wouldnâ€™t have to deal with knowing who you are. But he was a coward. No heart for it.\" \n\nNana thought Jalil lacked the heart too. He didnâ€™t stand up to his family or take responsibility. Instead, he made a secret deal to save face. The next day, he told her to pack her things from the servants' quarters and sent her away. \n\n\"You know what he told his wives to defend himself? That I forced myself on him. That it was my fault. Didi? This is what it means to be a woman in this world.\" \n\nNana set down the bowl of chicken feed and lifted Mariam's chin with her finger. \n\n\"Look at me, Mariam.\" \n\nMariam did so, reluctantly. \n\nNana continued, \"Learn this now and remember it well, my daughter: Just like a compass needle always points north, a manâ€™s accusing finger always finds a woman. Always. Donâ€™t forget that, Mariam.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Nana teaches Mariam that in their world, women are often unjustly blamed for men's actions."
