  "text": "A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS             \n9 \n\nNana brushed off the whole thing, but Mariam could see the happy glow in her eyes. For maybe the first time ever, leading up to her wedding, Nana felt real joy. \n\nAs Nana shared the story, Mariam sat on her lap, picturing her mom getting fitted for a wedding dress. She imagined her on a horse, shyly smiling under a veiled green gown, her hands painted red with henna, hair dusted with silver, braids held together with tree sap. She saw musicians playing the shahnai flute and banging on dohol drums, street kids cheering and chasing after them. 🎉\n\nBut then, just a week before the wedding, a jinn took over Nana. Mariam didn’t need an explanation; she had seen it happen too many times. Nana would suddenly collapse, her body tensing up, eyes rolling back, limbs shaking like something was choking her from the inside. There would be froth at her mouth—sometimes white, sometimes pink with blood. Then came the confusion, the mumbling. \n\nWhen the news hit Shindand, the parakeet seller's family called off the wedding. \n\n“They got spooked,” Nana said. \n\nThe wedding dress was put away, and after that, no more suitors came around. \n\n* * *  \n\nIn a clearing, Jalil and his two sons, Farhad and Muhsin, built the small kolba where Mariam would spend her first fifteen years. They used sun-dried bricks and mud mixed with straw. Inside, there were two cots, a wooden table, two straight-backed chairs, a window, and shelves for Nana’s clay pots and her favorite Chinese tea set. Jalil even added a cast iron stove for winter and stacked logs of wood behind the kolba. He built an outdoor tandoor for making bread and a chicken coop with a fence. He brought in some sheep and set up a trough for them. He had Farhad and Muhsin dig a deep hole a hundred yards from the willows for an outhouse. \n\nNana said Jalil could’ve hired workers to build the kolba, but he didn’t. \n\n“His idea of penance,” she said. \n\n* * *  \n\nWhen Nana recounted the day she gave birth to Mariam, she said no one came to help. It was a damp, cloudy day in spring 1959, during King Zahir Shah’s mostly uneventful reign. Nana said Jalil didn’t bother to call a doctor or even a midwife, even though he knew the jinn could take over during childbirth. She lay all alone on the kolba’s floor, a knife by her side, drenched in sweat. \n\n“When the pain got intense, I bit down on a pillow and screamed into it until my voice was gone. And still, no one came to wipe my face or give me a drink of water. And you, Mariam jo, you were in...\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Nana reflects on her brief happiness before Mariam's birth, which was overshadowed by her struggles and the cancellation of her wedding due to her fits."
