  "text": "A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS             \n6 \n\nJalil told Mariam about Queen Gauhar Shad, who built the famous minarets in Herat back in the 1500s. He painted a picture of Herat’s lush wheat fields, orchards, and bustling bazaars filled with life.\n\n“One day,” Jalil said, “there’s a pistachio tree where the great poet Jami is buried.” He leaned in close and whispered, “Jami lived over five hundred years ago. I took you there once when you were little, but you don’t remember.” \n\nAnd he was right. Mariam didn’t remember. Even though she lived just a short walk from Herat for the first fifteen years of her life, she’d never see that legendary tree. She’d never visit the famous minarets, pick fruit from the orchards, or wander through the wheat fields. But when Jalil spoke like this, she was mesmerized. She admired his knowledge and felt proud to have a dad who knew so much. \n\n“Such rich lies!” Nana said after Jalil left. “A rich man telling rich lies. He never took you to any tree. Don’t let him charm you. He betrayed us, your beloved father. He kicked us out of his fancy house like we were nothing. He did it with a smile.” \n\nMariam listened quietly. She never dared to tell Nana how much she hated hearing her talk about Jalil like that. The truth was, when Jalil was around, Mariam didn’t feel like a harami (illegitimate child). For an hour or two every Thursday, when Jalil came with smiles, gifts, and sweet words, she felt worthy of all the good things life had to offer. And for that, she loved him.\n\n* * *\n\nEven if it meant sharing him. \n\nJalil had three wives and nine kids—nine legitimate ones, all strangers to Mariam. He was one of the richest guys in Herat. He owned a cinema, which Mariam had never seen, but Jalil described it to her. She imagined its blue-and-tan tiles, private balcony seats, and a fancy ceiling. Double doors opened to a tiled lobby filled with posters of Hindi films. On Tuesdays, he said, kids got free ice cream at the concession stand. \n\nNana just smiled when he said that. After he left the kolba, she snickered, “The kids of strangers get ice cream. What do you get, Mariam? Just stories about ice cream.” \n\nBesides the cinema, Jalil owned land in Karokh and Farah, three carpet stores, a clothing shop, and a black 1956 Buick Roadmaster. He was well-connected—friends with the mayor and the provincial governor. He had a cook, a driver, and three housekeepers.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Mariam feels a mix of pride and longing for her father Jalil, who shares enchanting stories of their city, despite her mother's disdain for him."
