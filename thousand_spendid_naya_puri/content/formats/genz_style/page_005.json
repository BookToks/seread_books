  "text": "A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS             \n5 \nPART ONE \n\n1.  \n\nMariam was five when she first heard the word *harami*.\n\nIt was a Thursday. She remembered because Thursdays were special—Jalil would visit her at the *kolba* (that’s her little house). To kill time before he showed up, Mariam climbed onto a chair and grabbed her mom’s Chinese tea set. It was the only thing her mom, Nana, had from her own mother, who passed away when Nana was just two. Nana treasured each piece: the elegant spout, the hand-painted birds and flowers, and the dragon on the sugar bowl meant to scare off evil.\n\nBut then, that dragon slipped from Mariam's fingers and shattered on the wooden floor.\n\nWhen Nana saw the broken bowl, her face turned bright red, and her lip quivered. Her eyes—one lazy and one normal—stared at Mariam without blinking. Nana looked so furious that Mariam thought the jinn (evil spirit) might come back. But it didn’t. Instead, Nana yanked Mariam close and, through clenched teeth, spat, “You are a clumsy little *harami*! This is my reward for everything I’ve been through. An heirloom-breaking, clumsy little *harami*.”\n\nAt that moment, Mariam didn’t get it. She had no clue what *harami*—bastard—meant. She wasn’t old enough to see the unfairness of it, to realize that the ones who create *harami* are the real problem, not the *harami* themselves, who are just born into it. But she sensed, from Nana’s tone, that being a *harami* was something shameful, like a bug—like the cockroaches Nana always cursed and swept away.\n\nAs Mariam grew older, she began to understand. It was how Nana said the word, almost like she was spitting it, that made Mariam feel its sting. She realized that a *harami* was unwanted; she, Mariam, was an illegitimate child who would never have what others did: love, family, a home, acceptance.\n\nJalil never called her that. He always said she was his little flower. He loved sitting her on his lap and telling her stories, like how Herat, where Mariam was born in 1959, was once the heart of Persian culture, home to writers, artists, and Sufis.\n\n“You couldn’t stretch a leg here without poking a poet in the ass,” he laughed. 🌸\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Mariam, a young girl labeled as a \"harami\" by her mother, grapples with her identity and the stigma of being an illegitimate child."
