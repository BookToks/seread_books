  "text": "**A Thousand Splendid Suns**\n\nNana had once been one of the housekeepers, living a simple life until everything changed when she found out she was pregnant. The moment her belly began to swell, it was as if the air had been sucked out of Herat. Jalil’s family gasped collectively, and the tension was palpable. His in-laws were furious, vowing that blood would flow if he didn’t act. The wives demanded he kick Nana out. Even her own father, a humble stone carver from the nearby village of Gul Daman, disowned her. He packed his bags and took a bus to Bran, disappearing from her life forever.\n\nOne morning, as Nana tossed seeds to the chickens outside their little home, she sighed and said, \"Sometimes, I wish my father had been brave enough to take one of his knives and do the honorable thing. It might have been better for me.\" She paused, glancing at Mariam. \"Maybe it would have spared you the pain of knowing what you are. But he was a coward. He didn’t have the heart for it.\"\n\nNana believed Jalil lacked that same courage. He didn’t stand up to his family or accept responsibility for what had happened. Instead, behind closed doors, he made a quick, face-saving deal. The next day, he had her gather her few belongings from the servants’ quarters and sent her away.\n\n\"You know what he told his wives to defend himself?\" Nana continued, bitterness creeping into her voice. \"He claimed I forced myself on him. That it was my fault. Didi? This is what it means to be a woman in this world.\"\n\nNana set down the bowl of chicken feed and gently lifted Mariam’s chin with her finger. \n\n“Look at me, Mariam.”\n\nReluctantly, Mariam met her gaze.\n\n“Listen closely, my daughter: Just like a compass needle always points north, a man’s accusing finger will always find a woman. Always. Remember that, Mariam.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Nana teaches Mariam that in their world, women are often unjustly blamed for men's actions."
