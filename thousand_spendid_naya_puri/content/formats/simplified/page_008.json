  "text": "A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS             \n8 \n2.\n\n\"To Jalil and his wives, I was like a weed. A mugwort. You too. And you weren't even born yet.\"  \n\n\"What's a mugwort?\" Mariam asked.  \n\n\"A weed,\" Nana said. \"Something you pull out and throw away.\"  \n\nMariam felt sad inside. Jalil didn’t treat her like a weed. He never had. But she thought it was better to keep quiet about it.  \n\n\"Unlike weeds, I had to be taken care of, you see, because of you. That was the deal Jalil made with his family.\"  \n\nNana said she refused to live in Herat.  \n\n\"For what? To see him drive his other wives around all day?\"  \n\nShe also didn’t want to live in her father's empty house in Gul Daman, which was on a steep hill two kilometers north of Herat. She wanted to live somewhere far away, where neighbors wouldn’t stare at her belly, point at her, laugh, or, even worse, pretend to be nice.  \n\n\"And believe me,\" Nana said, \"it was a relief for your father to have me out of sight. He liked it that way.\"  \n\nIt was Muhsin, Jalil's oldest son from his first wife, Khadija, who suggested the clearing. It was on the edge of Gul Daman. To get there, you had to take a bumpy dirt road that split off from the main road between Herat and Gul Daman. The road was surrounded by knee-high grass and bright yellow and white flowers. It went uphill to a flat field with tall poplar and cottonwood trees and wild bushes. From up there, you could see the tips of the rusty windmill in Gul Daman on one side and all of Herat below on the other side. The road ended next to a wide stream filled with trout, coming down from the Safid-koh mountains around Gul Daman. Two hundred yards upstream, toward the mountains, there was a circle of weeping willow trees. In the shade of the willows was the clearing.  \n\nJalil went to check it out. When he came back, Nana said he sounded like a guard bragging about his clean prison.  \n\n\"And so, your father built us this dump.\"  \n\n* * *  \n\nNana almost got married once when she was fifteen. The guy was a boy from Shindand who sold parakeets. Mariam knew the story from Nana herself.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Nana reflects on her past and the circumstances surrounding her relationship with Jalil, expressing her feelings of being treated like a weed and her desire for isolation."
