  "text": "A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS\n\nNana used to be one of the housekeepers. But everything changed when she got pregnant. When that happened, Jalil's family gasped in shock. His in-laws said there would be trouble. His wives insisted he should get rid of her. Nana's father, who was a poor stone carver in the nearby village of Gul Daman, disowned her. Feeling ashamed, he left and took a bus to Bran, never to return.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" Nana said one morning while feeding the chickens outside their small house, \"I wish my father had been brave enough to end it all. It might have been better for me.\" She threw more seeds into the coop, paused, and looked at Mariam. \"Maybe it would have been better for you too. You wouldn't have to feel the pain of knowing who you are. But he was a coward. He didn't have the heart to do it.\"\n\nNana said Jalil also didn’t have the heart to do the right thing. He didn’t stand up to his family or take responsibility for what happened. Instead, he quickly made a deal behind closed doors. The next day, he made her pack her things from the servants' quarters where she lived and sent her away.\n\n\"Do you know what he told his wives to defend himself? He said I forced myself on him. That it was my fault. Do you see? This is what it means to be a woman in this world.\"\n\nNana stopped feeding the chickens and lifted Mariam's chin with her finger.\n\n\"Look at me, Mariam.\"\n\nMariam looked up reluctantly.\n\nNana said, \"Learn this and remember it well, my daughter: Just like a compass always points north, a man’s finger always points at a woman. Always. Remember that, Mariam.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Nana teaches Mariam that in their world, women are often blamed for men's actions and suffer the consequences of male cowardice."
