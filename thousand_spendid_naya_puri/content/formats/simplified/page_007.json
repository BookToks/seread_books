  "text": "A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS             \n7 \n\nNana used to be one of the housekeepers. But things changed when she got pregnant. When that happened, Jalil's family gasped in shock. His in-laws said there would be trouble. The wives demanded that he kick her out. Nana's father, who was a poor stone carver in a nearby village, disowned her. He packed his things and left for Bran, never to return. \n\n\"Sometimes,\" Nana said one morning while feeding the chickens outside their home, \"I wish my father had been brave enough to use one of his knives and do the right thing. It might have been better for me.\" She threw more seeds into the coop, paused, and looked at Mariam. \"It could have been better for you too. It would have saved you from knowing what you are. But he was a coward. He didn’t have the heart for it.\" \n\nNana said Jalil also didn’t have the heart to do the right thing. He didn’t stand up to his family, his wives, or take responsibility for what happened. Instead, behind closed doors, he quickly made a deal. The next day, he made her pack her things from the servants' quarters where she lived and sent her away. \n\n\"You know what he told his wives to defend himself? That I forced him. That it was my fault. Do you see, Didi? This is what it means to be a woman in this world.\" \n\nNana put down the chicken feed. She lifted Mariam's chin with her finger. \n\n\"Look at me, Mariam.\" \n\nMariam looked at her reluctantly. \n\nNana said, \"Learn this now and learn it well, my daughter: Just like a compass always points north, a man’s finger always points at a woman. Always. Remember that, Mariam.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Nana teaches Mariam that in their world, women are often unjustly blamed for men's actions."
