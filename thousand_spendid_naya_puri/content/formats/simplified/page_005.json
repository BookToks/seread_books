  "text": "A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS             \n5 \nPART ONE \n \n1. \n \nMariam was five years old the first time she heard the word harami. \n \nIt happened on a Thursday. Mariam remembered it was Thursday because she always felt restless that day, waiting for Jalil to visit her at the kolba. To pass the time until she would finally see him, crossing the grass and waving, Mariam climbed onto a chair and took down her mother's Chinese tea set. This tea set was the only thing Mariam's mother, Nana, had from her own mother, who died when Nana was two. Nana loved each piece of the blue-and-white porcelain, especially the pot's spout, the painted birds and flowers, and the dragon on the sugar bowl meant to keep away evil. \n \nBut then, the sugar bowl slipped from Mariam's fingers and fell to the wooden floor, breaking into pieces. \n \nWhen Nana saw the bowl, her face turned red, and her lip shook. Her eyes, both the lazy one and the good one, stared at Mariam without blinking. Nana looked so angry that Mariam was scared the jinn would come back into her mother. But the jinn didn’t come that time. Instead, Nana grabbed Mariam’s wrists, pulled her close, and, through gritted teeth, said, \"You are a clumsy little harami. This is my reward for everything I've been through. A broken heirloom from a clumsy little harami.\" \n \nAt that moment, Mariam didn’t understand what the word harami—bastard—meant. She was too young to see that it was unfair, that the people who made her a harami were the ones to blame, not her, who had done nothing wrong except be born. Mariam guessed, from the way Nana said the word, that being a harami was something ugly and shameful, like the cockroaches Nana always cursed and swept out of the kolba. \n \nLater, when she was older, Mariam understood. It was the way Nana said the word, almost like she was spitting it at her, that made Mariam feel its full sting. She then realized that a harami was something unwanted; that she, Mariam, was a person who was not legitimate and would never have the same things as others, like love, family, home, and acceptance. \n \nJalil never called Mariam this name. He called her his little flower. He liked to sit her on his lap and tell her stories, like the time he said that Herat, the city where Mariam was born in 1959, used to be the center of Persian culture, home to writers, painters, and Sufis. \n \n\"You couldn't stretch a leg here without poking a poet in the ass,\" he laughed.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Mariam, a young girl, grapples with her identity as an illegitimate child, feeling the sting of her mother's harsh words and the societal stigma attached to being a \"harami.\""
