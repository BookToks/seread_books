  "text": "A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS             \n\nNana brushed off the memory, but Mariam could see a happy look in her eyes. Maybe for the only time in her life, in the days before her wedding, Nana had really been happy.  \n\nAs Nana told the story, Mariam sat on her lap and imagined her mother getting fitted for a wedding dress. She pictured her on a horse, smiling shyly behind a green veil, her hands painted red with henna, her hair decorated with silver dust, and her braids held together with tree sap. She saw musicians playing the shahnai flute and banging on dohol drums, while street kids cheered and ran around.  \n\nThen, a week before the wedding, a jinn entered Nana's body. Mariam didn’t need any details; she had seen it happen many times. Nana would suddenly collapse, her body would stiffen, her eyes would roll back, and her arms and legs would shake like something was choking her from the inside. There would be froth at the corners of her mouth, sometimes white, sometimes pink with blood. Then came the drowsiness, the scary confusion, and the mumbling that didn’t make sense.  \n\nWhen the news got to Shindand, the parakeet seller's family canceled the wedding.  \n\n\"They got scared,\" Nana said.  \n\nThe wedding dress was put away. After that, there were no more men wanting to marry her.  \n\n* * *  \n\nIn a clearing, Jalil and his two sons, Farhad and Muhsin, built a small kolba where Mariam would live for the first fifteen years of her life. They made it with sun-dried bricks and covered it with mud and straw. Inside, there were two sleeping cots, a wooden table, two straight chairs, a window, and shelves where Nana kept clay pots and her favorite Chinese tea set. Jalil added a new cast iron stove for winter and stacked chopped wood behind the kolba. He built an outdoor oven for making bread and a chicken coop with a fence. He brought in a few sheep and made a feeding trough for them. He had Farhad and Muhsin dig a deep hole a hundred yards away and built an outhouse over it.  \n\nNana said Jalil could have hired workers to build the kolba, but he didn’t.  \n\n\"It was his way of making up for things.\"  \n\n* * *  \n\nIn Nana's story about the day she gave birth to Mariam, no one came to help. It happened on a damp, cloudy day in spring 1959, during the twenty-sixth year of King Zahir Shah's mostly calm forty-year rule. She said Jalil didn’t bother to call a doctor or even a midwife, even though he knew the jinn could enter her body and cause her to have a fit while giving birth. She lay all alone on the kolba's floor, a knife beside her, sweat covering her body.  \n\n\"When the pain got bad, I bit on a pillow and screamed into it until my voice was gone. And still, no one came to wipe my face or give me a drink of water. And you, Mariam jo, you were in\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Nana reflects on her brief happiness before Mariam's birth, which was overshadowed by her struggles and the cancellation of her wedding due to her fits."
