  "text": "A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS             \n10 \n\n\"No rush. You made me lie on that cold, hard floor for almost two days. I didn't eat or sleep; all I did was push and pray for you to come out.\"  \n\n\"I'm sorry, Nana.\"  \n\n\"I cut the cord between us myself. That's why I had a knife.\"  \n\n\"I'm sorry.\"  \n\nNana always gave a slow, heavy smile here, which seemed to show either blame or forgiveness. Mariam could never tell. It didn't occur to young Mariam to think about how unfair it was to apologize for how she was born.  \n\nBy the time she turned ten, Mariam stopped believing the story of her birth. She believed Jalil’s version, that even though he was away, he arranged for Nana to go to a hospital in Herat where a doctor helped her. She had laid on a clean bed in a bright room. Jalil looked sad when Mariam told him about the knife.  \n\nMariam also started to doubt that she made her mother suffer for two whole days.  \n\n\"They told me it was all over in under an hour,\" Jalil said. \"You were a good daughter, Mariam jo. Even when you were born, you were a good daughter.\"  \n\n\"He wasn't even there!\" Nana shouted. \"He was in Takht-e-Safar, riding horses with his precious friends.\"  \n\nWhen they told him he had a new daughter, Nana said Jalil just shrugged, kept brushing his horse's mane, and stayed in Takht-e-Safar for another two weeks.  \n\n\"The truth is, he didn't even hold you until you were a month old. And when he did, he just looked at your long face and gave you back to me.\"  \n\nMariam stopped believing this part of the story too. Yes, Jalil admitted he had been riding in Takht-e-Safar, but when he heard the news, he didn’t shrug. He quickly rode back to Herat. He held her in his arms, ran his thumb over her flaky eyebrows, and sang her a lullaby. Mariam didn’t picture Jalil saying her face was long, even though it was true.  \n\nNana said she chose the name Mariam because it was her mother's name. Jalil said he picked the name because Mariam, the tuberose, was a beautiful flower.  \n\n\"Your favorite?\" Mariam asked.  \n\n\"Well, one of them,\" he said and smiled.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Mariam grapples with conflicting narratives about her birth and the relationships with her parents, leading her to question her mother's version of events."
