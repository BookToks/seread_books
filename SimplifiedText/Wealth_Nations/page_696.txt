Adam Smith

There are two main reasons why taxing money interest is not as good as taxing land rent.

First, everyone can easily find out how much land someone owns and how much it's worth. But when it comes to money and investments, it's usually a secret, and it's hard to figure out exactly how much someone has. The amount of money people have can change all the time—sometimes every day. If the government tried to check everyone's financial situation all the time to set taxes, it would be really annoying and nobody would like it.

Second, land can't be moved, but money and investments can be taken anywhere. If someone owns land, they have to stay in that country. But if someone has money, they can easily leave and take their investments to another country where taxes are lower or where they don't have to deal with annoying checks. If they take their money away, it would hurt the economy of the country they left because that money helps grow businesses and pay workers. If a tax makes people want to move their money out of a country, it would hurt everyone because there would be less money for the government and for people working.

Because of this, countries that tried to tax money instead of doing a lot of checking have had to settle for rough estimates. This means the tax isn't very accurate, and it’s usually set low enough that people don’t mind if their neighbors pay even less.

In England, there was a plan to tax money the same way they taxed land. When the land tax was set at four shillings for every pound, they wanted to tax money at the same rate. When the land tax was first introduced, the legal interest rate was six percent.
