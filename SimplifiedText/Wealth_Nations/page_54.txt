Adam Smith talks about how the market can have too few products or too many workers. When there aren’t enough jobs for tailors, their pay goes up. But if there are too many workers and not enough jobs, it can lower their pay and the prices of materials like colored silks and cloths. This means that merchants who have a lot of these materials might not make as much money.

Sometimes, the prices of things can stay high for a long time because of accidents, natural events, or government rules. If the demand for a product goes up and its price rises above what it usually is, the people selling that product might try to keep this a secret. If everyone knew about the high profits, many others would jump in to sell the same product, and then the price would drop back down.

If the market is far away from where the suppliers are, they might keep this secret for years and enjoy high profits without competition. However, these secrets usually don’t last long. 

In manufacturing, secrets can be kept longer than in trade. For example, if a dyer finds a cheaper way to make a specific color, he can benefit from this discovery for a long time, even passing it down to his family. His extra money comes from the high pay for his special work, and since this applies to all his products, it’s often seen as extra profit.

These price increases can happen because of specific events, and sometimes they can last for many years. Some natural products need special soil and conditions, which means only certain areas can produce them.
