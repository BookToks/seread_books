The Wealth of Nations

If the government owes money, it usually doesn't help anyone, and often makes things worse for the people it owes. If the people who lend money to the government are also in debt to others, they might be able to balance things out by paying their debts with the same money the government gave them. But most of the time, the people who lend money to the government are rich and are more like lenders than borrowers. So, when the government tries to pay them back in a tricky way, it usually just makes things worse for those lenders and spreads the problem to many innocent people.

This situation can really mess up people's finances, making lazy borrowers richer while hardworking lenders lose out. It shifts money from those who would use it wisely to those who might waste it. When a government needs to declare bankruptcy, just like a person does, being honest about it is the best option. It’s less embarrassing for the government and less harmful for the lenders. It’s not great for a government’s reputation to hide a real bankruptcy with a sneaky trick that everyone can see through, especially when that trick can cause a lot of damage.

Many governments, both old and new, have used these sneaky tricks when they had to. For example, after the first Punic War, the Romans changed their currency so that what used to be worth twelve ounces of copper was suddenly worth only two ounces. This allowed them to pay back a huge debt with only a small fraction of what they actually owed. You might think this would have caused a huge uproar, but it didn’t seem to bother anyone at the time. The law that made this change was passed by a representative and was likely popular among the people.

In Rome, like in many ancient societies, poor people often borrowed money from the rich, who charged high interest rates. This debt piled up and became too much for the borrowers to pay back, or for anyone else to help them with. The borrowers were scared of facing serious consequences if they couldn’t pay.
