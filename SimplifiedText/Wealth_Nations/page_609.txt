In 1722, a company asked the government if they could split their huge amount of money, over £33 million, into two equal parts. One half, which was more than £16.9 million, would be treated like other government bonds and wouldn’t be affected by any debts or losses caused by the company’s leaders. The other half would stay as trading money and could be affected by those debts and losses. The government thought this request was fair and agreed. 

In 1733, the company asked again if they could change three-fourths of their trading money into bonds, leaving only one-fourth for trading, which was risky because of the company leaders’ poor management. By this time, both their bonds and trading money had lost over £2 million each due to various payments from the government, so that one-fourth was only worth about £3.66 million. In 1748, the company gave up their claims against the king of Spain because of a treaty, which ended their trade with the Spanish West Indies. The rest of their trading money was turned into bonds, and the company stopped being a trading company altogether.

It’s important to note that the South Sea Company faced competition in their trade from other merchants. In places like Carthagena, Porto Bello, and La Vera Cruz, they had to compete with Spanish merchants who sold similar goods. In England, they also competed with English merchants who imported goods from the Spanish West Indies. Even though the goods from Spanish and English merchants might have had higher taxes, the losses from the company’s careless management were likely a bigger problem. It seems unlikely that a big company could succeed in foreign trade when private traders could easily compete with them. 

The old English East India Company was started in 1600 with a charter from Queen Elizabeth. In their first twelve trips to India, they traded as a regulated company with separate funds, but only used the company’s general ships. By 1612, they combined into one joint stock.
