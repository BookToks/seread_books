Some provinces have to pay a salt tax, while others don’t have to pay it at all. Some areas are also free from the exclusive sale of tobacco, which is mostly controlled by the farmers-general in the kingdom. The aides, which are similar to taxes in England, vary a lot from one province to another. Some provinces don’t have to pay these taxes and instead pay a different amount. In places where these taxes are collected, there are also local taxes that only apply to specific towns or areas.

The traites, which are like customs duties, split the kingdom into three main parts. First, there are the provinces under the tariff of 1664, known as the provinces of the five great farms, which include Picardy, Normandy, and most of the central provinces. Second, there are the provinces under the tariff of 1667, called the foreign provinces, which include many of the border areas. Third, some provinces are treated like foreign areas because they can trade freely with other countries, so they have to pay the same duties as foreign countries when trading with other parts of France. These include Alsace and the cities of Dunkirk, Bayonne, and Marseilles.

In both the provinces of the five great farms and the foreign provinces, there are many local taxes that only apply to specific towns or areas. Even in the provinces treated as foreign, like Marseilles, there are local taxes. It’s important to note that all these different tax rules make it harder for trade within the country and require more revenue officers to manage the borders of these provinces.

On top of the general rules from this complicated tax system, the wine trade, which is super important in France, faces extra restrictions in many provinces. This is because some vineyards get more support than others. The provinces known for their wines usually have fewer restrictions, which helps them sell more and manage their vineyards better.
