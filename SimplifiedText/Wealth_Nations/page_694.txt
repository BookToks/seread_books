This tax was later removed and replaced with the window tax, which has changed a couple of times. As of January 1775, the window tax adds a charge of three shillings for every house in England and one shilling for every house in Scotland. In England, the tax on windows starts at two pence for houses with seven windows or fewer and goes up to two shillings for houses with twenty-five windows or more.

The main problem with these kinds of taxes is that they are unfair. They hit poorer people harder than richer people. For example, a house that costs ten pounds in rent in a small town might have more windows than a house that costs five hundred pounds in rent in London. Even though the person living in the cheaper house is likely poorer, they end up paying more in taxes because of the window tax. This goes against the idea that taxes should be fair.

The window tax, like other house taxes, usually makes rents go down. If someone has to pay more in taxes, they can afford to pay less in rent. However, since the window tax was introduced, rents have actually gone up in almost every town and village in Great Britain that I know about. The demand for houses has increased so much that it has pushed rents up more than the window tax could bring them down. This shows that the country is doing well and that people are earning more money. If there hadn’t been a tax, rents might have gone up even more.

The profit from investments can be split into two parts: the part that pays the interest and belongs to the owner, and the extra part that is above what is needed to pay the interest. 

This extra profit isn’t something that should be taxed directly. It’s basically a reward for taking the risk and dealing with the hassle of investing. If the investor doesn’t get this reward, they won’t want to keep investing. If they were taxed based on their total profit, they would have to either raise their profit rate or pass the tax cost onto the interest they pay.
