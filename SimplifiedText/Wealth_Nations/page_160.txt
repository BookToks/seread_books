When new mines are found, more gold and silver come into the market. Since the amount of things people need and want stays the same, more metal means you can trade less of it for the same amount of stuff. So, when there’s more gold and silver because of new mines, their value goes down.

On the other hand, when a country gets richer and people produce more goods, they need more coins to buy and sell all those goods. As people have more stuff to trade, they will buy more fancy things like silver plates. The amount of coins will go up because they need it, and the amount of fancy items will go up because people want to show off. Just like artists get paid well when times are good, gold and silver will also be valued higher.

The price of gold and silver usually goes up when there are no new mines bringing in more metal. In rich countries, gold and silver are worth more than in poor countries. Gold and silver, like everything else, go where they can get the best price. The best prices are usually in places that can afford to pay more. Remember, the real cost of everything is based on how much people earn. In places where workers get paid well, the price of their work matches the cost of living. So, gold and silver will buy more food in a rich country than in a poor one. 

If two countries are far apart, the price difference can be huge because it’s hard to move the metals around. If they are close, the difference will be smaller and sometimes hard to notice because it’s easier to transport them. For example, China is a lot richer than any part of Europe, and food prices are very different there. Rice is much cheaper in China than wheat is anywhere in Europe. England is richer than Scotland, but the difference in money isn’t as big.
