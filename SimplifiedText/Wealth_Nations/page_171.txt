Germany, Sweden, Denmark, and Russia have all improved a lot in farming and making things. Italy hasn't really gotten worse. It started to decline before Spain took over Peru, but since then, it seems to have gotten a bit better. Spain and Portugal, on the other hand, are thought to have gotten worse. Portugal is a small part of Europe, and Spain's decline might not be as bad as people think. Back in the early 1500s, Spain was actually pretty poor compared to France, which has improved a lot since then. The emperor Charles V, who traveled a lot between the two countries, famously said that France had everything, while Spain lacked many things.

As Europe’s farming and manufacturing grew, they needed more silver coins to keep things running smoothly. Also, as more people became wealthy, they needed more silver for their jewelry and other items. 

America is a new place where silver from its mines can be sold. Since America is growing quickly in farming, industry, and population, its need for silver is also increasing fast. The English colonies are a completely new market that needs more silver for coins and jewelry, and this demand is growing in a continent that didn’t need it before. Most of the Spanish and Portuguese colonies are also new markets. Places like New Granada, Yucatan, Paraguay, and Brazil were home to tribes that didn’t have farming or crafts before Europeans arrived. Now, they have some of both. Even Mexico and Peru, while not completely new markets, are definitely bigger than they were before. 

Despite all the amazing stories about how great these countries were in the past, if you look at their history of being discovered and conquered, you can see that their people were actually much less skilled in farming, arts, and trade than the Tartar tribes in Ukraine are today. Even the Peruvians, who were the more advanced of the two groups, used gold and silver for decoration but didn’t have any coins. They traded goods directly instead of using money, which meant they didn’t have much specialization in jobs. Farmers had to build their own homes, make their own furniture, and even create their own clothes and farming tools. There were only a few craftsmen among them.
