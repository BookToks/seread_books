To get better at making things, you need to have enough workers, supplies, and tools ready ahead of time. When there are more workers in a job, they can split up their tasks better. This means that having more supplies helps improve how much work gets done.

When someone uses their resources to pay workers, they want to get the most work out of them. So, they try to organize the workers well and give them the best tools they can find or afford. The more resources someone has, the better they can do this. As a result, when there’s more money to spend, the amount of work done in a country increases, and the same amount of effort leads to even more results.

This is how having more resources affects work and productivity.

In the book I wrote, I explain what resources are, how they build up into different types of capital, and what happens when those capitals are used in different ways. The book has five chapters. In the first chapter, I talk about the different parts that a person’s or society’s resources can be divided into. In the second chapter, I explain what money is and how it works as part of society's resources. The resources can be used by the owner or lent to someone else. In the third and fourth chapters, I look at how resources work in both situations. The fifth chapter discusses how different ways of using capital affect the overall work done in the country and the yearly output from land and labor.
