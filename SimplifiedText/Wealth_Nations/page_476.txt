Adam Smith

The way different European countries treated their colonies shows a big difference in their policies. England had the best approach, but it was still not very fair or kind compared to the others.

So, how did Europe help start and grow the American colonies? It did this in one main way. It created and trained the people who could do amazing things and build a huge empire. No other place in the world has been able to create such capable people. The colonies got their education and big ideas from Europe, and for some of their important leaders, that’s pretty much all they got from it.

Now, what did Europe gain from discovering and colonizing America? 

These benefits can be split into two parts: the overall benefits for Europe as a whole and the specific benefits for each country that colonized America.

For Europe as a whole, the main benefits from discovering and colonizing America are more enjoyment and more industry. The extra goods from America brought a lot of different products to Europe that people couldn’t have gotten otherwise.
