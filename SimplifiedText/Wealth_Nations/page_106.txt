Adam Smith

In regular jobs, a few days of training might be enough. But, to get really good at these jobs, you need a lot of practice. A young person would work harder and pay more attention if they started as a worker who gets paid for what they can do. They would also have to pay for any materials they mess up because they’re still learning.

This way of learning would be more effective and less boring and expensive. However, the boss would lose out because they wouldn’t get the apprentice’s wages for seven years like they do now. In the end, the apprentice might not benefit either. Since the trade is easy to learn, there would be more people competing for jobs, which would lower their pay once they become skilled workers. This increase in competition would also cut into the bosses' profits and the workers' wages. Overall, the trades would suffer, but the public would benefit because the work would be cheaper.

To stop prices from dropping and affecting wages and profits, many companies and laws were created to limit competition. In the past, to start a company, you just needed the town's approval. In England, you also needed permission from the king. But this was often more about getting money from people than protecting their rights against unfair monopolies. After paying a fee, the king usually granted permission easily. If a group of workers wanted to act as a company without permission, they were often allowed to keep doing so as long as they paid a yearly fee to the king for their privileges.

The town’s leaders, who were usually traders and craftsmen, had control over these companies. It was in their best interest to keep the market from being flooded with too many of their own products.
