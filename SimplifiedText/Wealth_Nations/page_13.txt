I can tell you that a skilled nail maker can make over two or three hundred nails in a day, but those nails won't be very good. A blacksmith who usually makes nails but does other work too can only make about eight hundred to a thousand nails a day, even if he tries really hard. I've seen some boys under twenty who only make nails, and when they really focus, they can make over two thousand three hundred nails in a day. 

Making a nail isn't as easy as it sounds. The same person has to pump the bellows, manage the fire, heat the iron, and shape every part of the nail. When making the head of the nail, they even have to switch tools. Making something like a pin or a metal button is much simpler, and someone who does it all the time gets really good at it. The speed at which some of these tasks are done is way faster than what you'd think a person could do if they had never seen it before.

Also, the time lost when switching from one job to another is a bigger deal than you might think. It takes a while to move from one type of work to another, especially if it's in a different place with different tools. For example, a weaver who also farms loses a lot of time going back and forth between the loom and the field. If both jobs are done in the same place, it saves time, but there's still a lot of time wasted. When someone starts a new task, they often aren’t very focused at first and might just mess around instead of getting to work. 

This habit of being lazy and not really putting in effort is something that happens to country workers who have to switch tasks and tools all the time. It makes them less productive, even when they really need to get things done. So, besides not being as skilled, this habit can really cut down on how much work they can actually do.

Finally, everyone knows that using the right machines makes work a lot easier and faster. I don’t need to give examples; it’s pretty obvious.
