Adam Smith talks about different groups of workers. There are the unproductive workers, like servants, and then there are the employers who own the land and grow crops. Both groups rely on the landowners for their jobs. Even though they work hard, they don’t really create anything new or valuable. Instead, they just cost money that comes from the land’s total production.

However, the unproductive workers are still really important for the other two groups. Thanks to merchants and manufacturers, landowners can buy goods from other countries or get products made in their own country. This means they don’t have to do all the hard work themselves, which would take a lot more time and effort. The unproductive workers help landowners focus on farming without worrying about other tasks. Because of this focus, they can produce more crops, which covers the costs of the unproductive workers.

Even though unproductive workers don’t create new things, they help increase the overall production of the land. They allow farmers to concentrate on growing crops, making the farming process smoother and more efficient. 

It’s not in the best interest of landowners and farmers to limit the work of merchants and manufacturers. The more freedom these unproductive workers have, the more competition there will be in their jobs, which means cheaper products for the farmers and landowners.

On the flip side, unproductive workers shouldn’t take advantage of the other two groups. They are supported by the extra crops that landowners and farmers produce after taking care of their own needs. The more extra crops there are, the more the unproductive workers can be supported. The key to making everything work well is to have fairness, freedom, and equality among all groups.
