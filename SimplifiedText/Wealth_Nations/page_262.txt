Adam Smith talks about how money works in a country. He says that money is used in two main ways: first, between businesses buying from each other, and second, between businesses and regular people who buy things. 

Even though the same coins or bills can be used for both types of transactions, each type needs a certain amount of money to keep going. The total value of goods traded between businesses can never be more than what is sold to consumers since everything businesses buy is eventually sold to people. 

When businesses trade with each other, they usually deal with larger amounts of money. But when they sell to consumers, they often use smaller amounts, like a shilling or even a halfpenny. Smaller amounts of money can be used more often than larger ones. For example, a shilling gets passed around more than a guinea, and a halfpenny gets passed around even more than a shilling. So, even though consumers buy as much as businesses do, they can do it with less money because it moves around faster.

Paper money can be designed to be used mostly between businesses or also with consumers. In places like London, where bank notes are not used for amounts less than £10, paper money is mostly used between businesses. When a consumer gets a £10 note, they usually have to change it for smaller amounts when they want to buy something, so it often goes back to a business before the consumer has spent much of it. 

In Scotland, where bank notes can be as low as 20 shillings, paper money is used more between businesses and consumers. Before a law stopped smaller notes, they were used even more. In North America, paper money was often issued for just a shilling and was used widely. In some places in Yorkshire, it was even issued for as little as sixpence.
