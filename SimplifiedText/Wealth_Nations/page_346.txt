Adam Smith

The government will always give us the wine we need, and we can also count on it to provide us with all the gold and silver we can buy or use for different things.

The amount of stuff that people can buy or make in any country depends on how much people want it and are willing to pay for it. This is especially true for gold and silver because they are small but very valuable. It's easy to move gold and silver from places where they are cheap to places where they are more expensive. For example, if England needed more gold, a boat could bring a lot of it from places like Lisbon, and it could be turned into millions of coins. But if England needed the same value in grain, it would take a huge number of ships to bring it over, which wouldn't be possible.

If a country gets more gold and silver than it needs, there's nothing the government can do to stop it from leaving. Even strict laws in Spain and Portugal can't keep their gold and silver at home because they keep getting more from places like Peru and Brazil, which makes the price go down. On the other hand, if a country doesn't have enough gold and silver, the price will go up, and the government wouldn't need to try to bring more in. Even if they tried to stop it, they wouldn't be able to.

In the past, when the Spartans had money to buy gold and silver, they found ways to get around the laws that tried to keep it out. Similarly, strict laws can't stop cheaper tea from being imported from other countries because it's more affordable than the tea from British companies. A pound of tea is much bigger than the small amount of silver people usually pay for it.
