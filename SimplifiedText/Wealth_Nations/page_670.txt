Adam Smith talks about how money can make more money through interest and profits. If a place has saved up a lot of money, it can lend some of it to other countries or to its own people.

For example, the canton of Berne makes a lot of money by lending some of its saved money to other countries, mostly to France and England. The safety of this money depends on how secure those countries are and if they stay peaceful. If a war breaks out, the country that borrowed the money might not pay it back. This way of lending money to other countries is something special to Berne.

In the city of Hamburg, there’s a public pawn shop that lends money to people in the state. They charge six percent interest. This pawn shop supposedly makes the state about 150,000 crowns, which is around £33,750.

In Pennsylvania, the government found a way to lend money without having any saved up. They give people paper money that can be used like cash, which they promise to exchange for real money later. This paper money can be passed around like banknotes and is accepted for payments between people. This helped the government cover some of its yearly costs of about £4,500. 

The success of this idea depended on a few things: first, people needed something to use for trade besides gold and silver; second, the government needed to be trusted; and third, they had to be careful not to print too much paper money. The total value of the paper money couldn’t be more than what would have been needed in gold and silver. Other American colonies tried similar ideas, but they didn’t work out as well because they weren’t careful enough.
