Adam Smith talks about how merchants need enough resources to keep their businesses running in places like the East Indies. If they can’t find enough goods for their ships, they might miss the best time to return, which could cost them a lot of money. 

He argues that you can’t run a big trade operation without a special company, but that’s not true based on what we see in different countries. Usually, one merchant doesn’t have enough money to handle everything needed for a big trade. When a country is ready to trade, some merchants will focus on the main trade, while others will work on the smaller parts. 

If a country is ready to trade with the East Indies, its money will naturally spread out among all the different parts of that trade. Some merchants will decide to stay in the East Indies to get goods for ships owned by other merchants back in Europe. If European countries took control of their settlements in the East Indies away from exclusive companies and made them safer, it would be easier for their merchants to work there.

If a country doesn’t have enough money at a certain time to handle all parts of the East India trade, it means they aren’t ready for it yet. In that case, it might be better for them to buy East India goods from other European countries, even if they have to pay more. The extra cost wouldn’t be as bad as losing money by not using their resources for other important things that fit their needs better than trading directly with the East Indies. 

Even though Europeans have important settlements in Africa and the East Indies, they haven’t set up a lot of businesses in those places yet.
