Adam Smith says that rich people usually hire hard-working people, and they spend their money in a way that helps them and others, just like wealthy landowners do. 

The balance between people who create things and those who don’t depends a lot on how much of what a country produces goes back into making more stuff versus how much goes to pay for things like rent or profit. This balance is very different in rich countries compared to poor ones.

Right now, in wealthy European countries, a big part of what farmers grow goes back into helping them keep their farms running. The rest goes to pay for their profits and the rent they owe to landowners. In the past, when feudalism was common, farmers needed only a small amount of what they produced to keep their farms going. They usually had just a few animals that lived off the land that wasn’t farmed, and these animals often belonged to the landowner. Most of what they produced also belonged to the landowner, either as rent or profit. 

Farmers were often like servants who had to work for the landowner, and even those who weren’t were still very dependent on him. Even if they lived far away, they still had to answer to him. The landowner had control over all the work and help from the people who lived on his land. Nowadays, the landowner usually gets about a third or sometimes a fourth of what the land produces. However, rent has gone up a lot since the old days, and this share is now much bigger than it used to be. 

In rich European countries today, a lot of money is used in business and making things. Back in ancient times, there was only a little bit of trade and only simple products being made.
