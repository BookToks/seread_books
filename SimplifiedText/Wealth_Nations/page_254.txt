Adam Smith

He needs to quickly figure out what they are doing and see that they are not using their own money, but the money he gives them. But this isn't easy because they sometimes get loans from different banks, and the same people don’t always borrow from each other. Instead, they might go around a big group of people who help each other get money, making it hard to tell the difference between real and fake loans. A real loan is when someone who actually owes money borrows from someone who is owed money. A fake loan is when the bank gives money, but there isn’t a real person who owes it back.

Even if a banker realizes this, it might be too late. They might have already given out so many loans that if they stop, all those borrowers could go bankrupt, which could hurt the bank too. To protect themselves, the banker might need to keep lending for a while but try to slowly pull back. They would make it harder to get loans so that those borrowers would have to find other banks or ways to get money. This way, the banker could eventually escape the situation.

The problems that the Bank of England and other major banks in London started to create by making it harder to get loans really upset those borrowers. They thought their own struggles were the country’s problems and blamed the banks for not helping enough. They believed it was the banks' job to lend them as much money as they wanted for as long as they wanted. However, by refusing to give more loans to people they had already lent too much to, the banks were actually trying to protect their own reputation and the country’s financial health.

Amid all this noise and trouble, a new bank was set up in Scotland specifically to help with the financial issues.
