From 1748 to 1753, a lot of silver and gold was brought into Portugal. The total amount of silver was over 1.1 million pounds, and the gold was almost 50,000 pounds. If you calculate the value, the silver was worth about £3.4 million, and the gold was worth around £2.3 million. Together, that adds up to about £5.7 million. The merchant who tracked this information was very experienced, so his numbers are likely accurate.

A writer who studied European history in the Americas said that from 1754 to 1764, Spain brought in about 13.98 million piastres of gold and silver each year. If you include what might have been smuggled in, the total could be around 17 million piastres, which is about £3.8 million. He also detailed where the gold and silver came from and how much of each was imported. He mentioned that if we look at the taxes paid to the king of Portugal, we could estimate that around £2.25 million worth of gold came from Brazil. Adding everything up, the total amount of precious metals brought into Spain and Portugal each year is about £6.08 million.

Other reliable sources also say that the total annual import of precious metals is around £6 million, sometimes a bit more or less. However, the amount coming into Cadiz and Lisbon isn’t as much as what the mines in America produce. Some gold and silver are sent to Manila by ships, and some is used in illegal trading between Spanish colonies and other European countries.
