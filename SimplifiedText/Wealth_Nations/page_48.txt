Money in a country comes from three main sources: wages, profits, and rent. Every year, the work done by people in society creates value, and this value is shared among different people. Wages are what workers earn for their labor, profits are what business owners make from their investments, and rent is what landowners get for their land. All other types of income come from one of these three sources.

Money earned from investments, by someone who runs a business, is called profit. If someone lends their money to another person, the money they earn from that is called interest. This interest is what the borrower pays the lender for letting them use the money. The borrower takes the risk and does the work to use the money, while the lender provides the money to make that profit.

For example, a person who farms their own land might earn both rent and profit. They might just call all their earnings profit, mixing up rent and profit in everyday conversation. Many farmers in North America and the West Indies are in this situation. They farm, and...
