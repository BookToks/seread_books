People often enjoy building impressive things, like big highways, because they get noticed by important people. This makes them feel good and helps them keep their status. But when it comes to doing a lot of smaller projects that don’t look impressive or get any attention, those tasks seem too boring and unimportant for someone in power to focus on. Because of this, those smaller projects usually get ignored.

In places like China and other Asian countries, the government takes care of fixing the main roads and keeping the canals in good shape. The governor of each area is told to pay attention to these tasks, and how well they do is judged based on their efforts in this area. Because of this, maintaining roads and canals is a big deal in those countries, especially in China, where they say the roads and canals are much better than what we have in Europe. However, the stories about these projects that come to Europe are often told by travelers who might not be very smart or are just exaggerating. If smarter and more honest people had looked at these projects, they might not seem so amazing.

One traveler named Bernier described some projects in India, and his account was much less impressive than what others had said. It might be that, just like in France, the big roads and important connections that people talk about are the ones that get attention, while everything else is left out. In China, India, and other Asian countries, the government mostly makes money from land taxes, which go up or down based on how much food the land produces. So, the government’s income is closely linked to farming and how much food they can grow. To make sure they grow as much food as possible and that it’s valuable, they need to make it easy for people to trade and communicate across the country.
