If a part of the British Empire doesn’t help with money or military support, it shouldn’t be considered a real province. Instead, it’s more like a fancy accessory to the empire. If the empire can’t afford to keep this accessory, it should definitely get rid of it. And if it can’t make enough money to cover its costs, it should at least try to spend less.

If the colonies still want to be seen as part of the British Empire but refuse to pay British taxes, defending them in future wars could end up costing Britain a lot, just like it has in the past. For over a hundred years, the leaders of Britain have kept telling people that they have a huge empire across the Atlantic. But this empire has mostly just been a fantasy. It’s not a real empire or a gold mine; it’s just an idea that has cost a lot of money without bringing in any profit. In fact, the way the colony trade is set up has mostly hurt the average person instead of helping them.

It’s definitely time for our leaders to either make this dream a reality or wake up from it and help the people see the truth. If they can’t make it happen, they should just let it go. If any part of the British Empire can’t help support the whole empire, then it’s time for Britain to stop spending money to defend those areas during wars and to support them during peace. They should adjust their plans to fit the reality of their situation.
