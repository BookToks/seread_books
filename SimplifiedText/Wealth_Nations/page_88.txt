When apprentices don’t have work, it’s bad for them. But in country jobs, workers learn the harder parts of their work while doing easier tasks, and their own work helps them get by. So, it makes sense that in Europe, skilled workers like mechanics and manufacturers earn more than regular laborers. They do earn more, and because of that, people often see them as a higher class. 

However, the difference isn’t huge. For example, the daily or weekly pay for workers in common jobs, like making simple clothes, is only a bit more than what regular laborers make. Their jobs are usually more stable, so over a year, they might earn a bit more. But that extra pay mostly just covers the higher costs of their training. 

Jobs that need a lot of education, like artists, lawyers, and doctors, take even longer and cost more to learn. So, they should get paid a lot more, and they usually do. 

The money made from investments doesn’t really change based on how easy or hard it is to learn a trade. In big cities, most trades are about the same in terms of difficulty. One type of trade isn’t really harder than another. 

Also, how much workers get paid can change based on how steady their jobs are. Some jobs have more regular work than others. Most manufacturing jobs keep workers busy almost every day, but jobs like masonry or bricklaying can be unpredictable. If the weather is bad, they can’t work, and they might not have customers all the time. So, when they do earn money, it has to cover the times when they’re not working and also make up for the stress of not knowing when they’ll get their next job. Because of this, masons and bricklayers usually earn a lot more than regular laborers. While regular laborers might make four or five shillings a week, masons and bricklayers often earn seven or eight.
