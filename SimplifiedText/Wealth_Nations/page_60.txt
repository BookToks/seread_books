Adam Smith talks about workers who sometimes team up to ask for higher pay. They often say it’s because food prices are high or their bosses are making a lot of money from their work. Whether they are being aggressive or just trying to defend themselves, they always make a lot of noise. They act out of desperation, like people who feel they have no choice but to either starve or scare their bosses into giving them what they want.

On the other side, the bosses also make a lot of noise and call for help from the authorities to enforce strict laws against workers teaming up. Because of this, workers rarely gain anything from their loud protests. Usually, these protests end up punishing or ruining the leaders of the movement instead of helping the workers.

Even though bosses usually have the upper hand in these arguments, there is a minimum amount that workers can be paid. A worker needs to earn enough money to live. In fact, they often need to earn a bit more than just enough to survive, or they wouldn’t be able to support a family. If they didn’t earn enough, there wouldn’t be any future workers after the first generation. 

One expert, Mr. Cantillon, believes that the lowest-paid workers need to earn at least double what they need for themselves so they can raise two kids. This is because the mother’s work is mostly taken up by caring for the children, so she can only earn enough for herself. It’s also estimated that half of all kids don’t make it to adulthood. So, to ensure that two kids survive, poor workers need to try to raise at least four. The cost of raising four kids is thought to be about the same as the cost of supporting one adult. Mr. Cantillon also says that the work of a strong slave is worth double what it costs to keep them alive, and he thinks the lowest-paid worker’s labor can’t be worth less than that.
