The Wealth of Nations

In the last hundred years, trade has really grown, especially now. The Swedes and Danes started trading with East India this century. Even Russia is now trading with China by sending caravans over land through Siberia to Beijing. The East India trade for most countries, except for France (which got hit hard in the last war), has been growing a lot. More and more people in Europe are buying East India goods, which is creating more jobs for everyone involved.

For example, tea wasn’t popular in Europe until the middle of the last century. Now, the English East India company brings in over a million and a half worth of tea every year just for people in England. And that’s not even enough because a lot more tea is being smuggled in from places like Holland, Sweden, and France when their East India company was doing well. The demand for Chinese porcelain, spices from the Moluccas, and fabrics from Bengal has also gone up a lot.

In the last century, the amount of European ships involved in East India trade wasn’t much bigger than what the English East India company had before they cut down their shipping. When Europeans first started trading in places like China and India, the value of gold and silver there was higher than in Europe, and it still is. In countries that grow rice, which can produce two or even three harvests a year, there’s way more food than in corn-growing countries of the same size. Because of this, those countries have a lot more people living in them.

The rich people in these rice-growing countries have more food than they can eat, so they can buy more labor from others. This means that the wealthy in China or India often have bigger and fancier entourages than the richest people in Europe. Because they have so much extra food, they can trade it for rare and valuable things like gold, silver, and precious stones, which are highly sought after by the rich. Even if the mines in India were just as rich as those in Europe, the valuable goods would still trade for more food in India than in Europe.
