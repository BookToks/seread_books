Adam Smith

Some people tried to make themselves look good to the group they first talked to about changing things. Many of them, maybe even most, tried to impress others by taking this strict way of doing things too far, which sometimes made them seem more respected by regular folks.

A wealthy and important person is seen as a key member of society. Everyone pays attention to what he does, so he has to be careful about his actions. His reputation depends on how much respect people have for him. He can’t do anything that would make him look bad to others, and he has to follow the rules of behavior that society expects from someone in his position. 

On the other hand, a person who is not wealthy doesn’t stand out in society. If he lives in a small village, people might notice how he acts, and he might care about it too. In this case, he has a reputation to protect. But once he moves to a big city, he becomes just another face in the crowd. No one pays attention to him, so he might start to ignore his own behavior and get involved in bad habits. 

He only really gets noticed again if he joins a small religious group. This gives him a new sense of importance. The people in his group care about how he acts because it reflects on them. If he does something wrong or doesn’t follow the strict rules they have, he could get kicked out of the group, which is a big deal. In these small religious groups, people usually have better behavior than in larger churches. However, their rules can sometimes be too strict and not very friendly.

There are two simple ways the government could help fix the overly strict or unfriendly behaviors in these small groups without causing any trouble. The first way is to promote the study of science and philosophy, which could be made available to everyone.
