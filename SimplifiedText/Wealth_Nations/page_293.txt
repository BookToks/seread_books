The Wealth of Nations

It's hard to imagine how money can be used in ways that don't fit into one of four main categories. 

Each of these four ways of using money is really important. They either help each other grow or make life easier for everyone in society. 

First, if money isn’t used to produce basic goods in enough amounts, then we can’t have factories or any kind of trade. 

Second, if money isn’t used to turn those basic goods into products that people can actually use, then those products might not even be made. If they were made without demand, they wouldn’t be worth anything, and they wouldn’t help society get richer. 

Third, if money isn’t used to transport these goods from places where they are made to places where they are needed, then only a small amount would be produced, just enough for the local area. Merchants help by trading extra goods from one place for goods from another, which helps both places grow and enjoy more products. 

Fourth, if money isn’t used to break down large amounts of goods into smaller portions that people actually want, everyone would have to buy way more than they need. For example, if there were no butchers, people would have to buy an entire cow or sheep at once. This would be really inconvenient for rich people, but even worse for poor people. 

If a poor worker had to buy a month’s worth of food all at once, they would have to use up a lot of their money that could be used for tools or supplies for their job. This would mean they wouldn’t make any money from those tools. It’s way better for them to buy food as they need it, whether that’s daily or even hourly. This way, they can use most of their money to invest in their work. 

The extra profit they make from this is much more than the extra cost they pay to retailers. The negative views some writers have about shopkeepers and tradespeople are completely wrong. Instead of needing to tax them or limit how many there are, we actually need more of them.
