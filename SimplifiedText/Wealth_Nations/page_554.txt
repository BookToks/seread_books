Adam Smith believed that if people had more freedom to trade, it would help businesses grow, whether they used their own ships or ships from other countries. 

Manufactured goods, which are often small but valuable, can be moved between countries at a lower cost than raw materials. Because of this, they are usually the main part of international trade in many countries. In places that are smaller or not as good for trade as China, they often need help from foreign markets to succeed. Without a big market outside their own country, businesses struggle, especially in places where it’s hard to move goods from one area to another.

Manufacturing really depends on how well tasks can be divided among workers. The more a market can grow, the more division of labor can happen. China has a huge population, different climates, and easy transportation by water, which means it has a big enough home market to support large-scale manufacturing and allow for many specialized jobs. In fact, China’s market might be almost as big as all the markets in Europe combined.

If China could trade more with other countries, especially using their own ships, it would boost their manufacturing even more. They would learn to use and build machines from other countries and pick up new skills and techniques. Right now, they don’t have many chances to learn from other nations, except for Japan.

In ancient Egypt and India, the government focused more on farming than on other jobs. In both places, people were divided into different groups or classes, and each group was stuck doing the same job for generations.
