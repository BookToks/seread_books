The Wealth of Nations

The person buys raw materials and finished products to sell, which helps keep other businesses running. By doing this, he helps support workers in society and increases the total value of what everyone produces each year. His money also pays for the sailors and drivers who move his goods around, and it raises the prices of those goods because of his profits and the wages of the workers. This is the main way he helps create jobs and adds value to what society produces each year. His impact is much bigger than that of a retailer.

Part of the money a factory owner uses goes into tools and machines for the trade, and it also replaces what he buys from other workers. Some of his money is spent on materials, which helps pay farmers and miners who provide those materials. A big chunk of his money is always paid to the workers he hires. This increases the value of the materials because of their wages and the factory owner's profits from everything used in the business. So, he creates a lot more jobs and adds more value to what society produces than a similar amount of money in the hands of a wholesale merchant.

No amount of money creates more jobs than what a farmer has. Not only do his workers help, but so do his animals. In farming, nature also helps out, and even though it doesn’t cost anything, what it produces is valuable too. The main tasks in farming are not just about making more food, but also about guiding nature to grow the best plants for people. A field full of weeds can sometimes produce as much as a well-kept vineyard or cornfield. Planting and caring for crops often manage nature’s ability to produce rather than just speeding it up, and after all the work, nature still has a big role to play. 

The workers and animals on a farm not only create enough value to cover their own needs and the farmer’s profits, but they create even more value. Besides what the farmer makes, they also help generate income for the landlord.
