Adam Smith talks about how countries can be friends or enemies. When they are friends, they can help each other, but when they are enemies, it just makes things worse. Both countries are rich and work hard, but their businesses worry about competing with each other. This competition creates jealousy, and both sides get angry, claiming that the other will ruin them because of trade issues.

In Europe, many countries have been warned that they are going to fail because of trade problems. But even with all the worry and attempts to make trade work in their favor, no country has actually become poorer because of this. In fact, the more countries open their ports to trade with others, the richer they become. There are a few places in Europe that are somewhat like free ports, but no country is completely one. Holland is the closest, and it relies heavily on trade to support its wealth and needs.

There is another important idea called the balance of annual produce and consumption. This is different from trade balance. If a country's production is greater than what it consumes, it gets richer over time. This means they are living within their means, saving money, and using that savings to grow even more. But if a countryâ€™s production is less than what it consumes, it starts to lose money. In this case, they are spending more than they earn, which eats away at their savings and makes them poorer.
