The Wealth of Nations

In the past, people thought that the main goal of life was to be happy and perfect. But later on, when they started teaching philosophy mainly to support religion, they began to see life’s duties as mostly about preparing for the afterlife. Old philosophers believed that being virtuous would lead to true happiness in this life. However, modern thinkers often said that being virtuous usually meant you wouldn’t be happy in this life. They thought you could only earn a place in heaven by suffering and living like a monk, not by being kind and generous. This way of thinking made moral philosophy in schools mostly about strict rules and self-denial, which messed up one of the most important areas of philosophy.

This is how philosophy was usually taught in many universities across Europe. They started with logic, then moved on to ontology (the study of being), followed by pneumatology (the study of the soul and God). After that, they taught a messed-up version of moral philosophy that was linked to the ideas about the soul and what happens after death. Finally, they usually wrapped things up with a basic and shallow physics course.

The changes that European universities made to the old philosophy curriculum were meant to train religious leaders and help them study theology better. But the added complexity and strict rules didn’t help make it better for teaching regular people or improving their understanding or character.

This way of teaching philosophy is still common in many European universities today, though the effort put into it varies from one school to another. In some wealthy universities, teachers often just cover bits and pieces of this flawed curriculum, and they usually do it in a careless and shallow way.

Even though there have been some improvements in different areas of philosophy in modern times, most of the traditional teachings still haven’t changed much.
