Adam Smith says that there are fewer tax officers for this tax than for any other tax that brings in almost the same amount of money. The tax for each area doesn’t go up when the rent goes up, so the government doesn’t benefit from the improvements that landlords make to their land. Sometimes, these improvements help other landlords in the area, but any extra tax that might come from them is so small that it doesn’t stop landlords from making those improvements or keep the amount of crops produced low. Since the tax doesn’t reduce the amount of crops, it also doesn’t raise their prices. It doesn’t stop people from working hard; the only downside for landlords is that they have to pay the tax.

The benefit that landlords get from the steady way land is valued for tax purposes is mostly due to things that have nothing to do with the tax itself. It’s partly because most of the country is doing really well, and rents for almost all properties in Great Britain have been going up since this tax valuation started, with very few going down. So, landlords have been able to keep the difference between what they would pay based on current rents and what they actually pay based on the old valuation. If the country had been in a different situation, with rents going down because farming was declining, landlords would have lost that difference. Since the changes after the revolution, the steady valuation has helped landlords but hurt the government. If things had been different, it could have helped the government and hurt the landlords instead.

The tax is paid in money, and the land’s value is also in money. Since this valuation started, the value of silver has stayed pretty stable, and there hasn’t been any change in the money’s standard, like its weight or quality. If the value of silver had gone up a lot, like it did before the discovery of American mines, the steady valuation could have been really tough on landlords. If the value of silver had dropped a lot, which it did for about a hundred years after those mines were found, the same steady valuation would have greatly reduced the government’s revenue from this tax. If there had been any big changes to the money’s standard, like reducing the amount of silver in coins, it would have affected things too.
