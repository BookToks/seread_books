Adam Smith

In England, the total tax collected was £5,507,308.18.8¼, and it only cost about five and a half percent to collect it. But, we have to take away the money spent on rewards and refunds for exporting certain goods, which brings the total amount collected down to less than five million. After paying all the costs, the actual money made that year was £4,975,652.19.6. 

Collecting taxes on salt and other goods is more expensive. The money made from customs taxes is less than two and a half million, and it costs more than ten percent to collect it because of officer salaries and other costs. The extra money that customs officers make on the side is often much more than their salaries, sometimes even double or triple. So, if the costs for officers and other expenses are more than ten percent of the customs revenue, the total cost could be over twenty or thirty percent. On the other hand, excise officers don’t get many extra benefits, and their system is newer, so it’s usually less corrupt than customs, which has had time to develop some bad practices. 

If we charged a single tax on malt instead of multiple taxes on malt and beer, we could save over £50,000 a year on excise costs. By limiting customs taxes to just a few types of goods and collecting them like excise taxes, we could save even more money. 

However, these taxes can make it harder for some businesses to thrive. They raise the price of the taxed goods, which can lead to fewer people buying them and, as a result, less production. If the goods are made locally, it means less work for people who produce them. If the goods come from abroad and the tax raises their price, local products might sell better, but this can hurt other local industries. For example, if a manufacturer in Birmingham has to pay more for foreign wine, they will have to sell their hardware for less to afford it. This makes their hardware less valuable, and they have less motivation to keep making it. The more expensive the goods get for consumers, the less they can buy.
