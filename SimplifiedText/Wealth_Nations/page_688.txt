Adam Smith was a big deal in many areas of the country. Some workers from the East India Company, pretending to help the government get more money, changed how things were paid in some places. This change might make people less interested in farming and could lead to more cheating when collecting taxes. The amount of money collected has dropped a lot since the company took over. While the workers might be making more money from this change, it’s probably hurting both their bosses and the country.

Rent for a house can be split into two parts: building-rent and ground-rent. 

Building-rent is the profit a builder makes from the money spent on building the house. To make sure builders earn as much as others do, this rent needs to be enough to pay them back what they could have earned if they had invested their money somewhere safe. It also needs to cover repairs or replace the money spent on building over time. So, building-rent is usually based on how much money people can earn from loans. If the interest rate is 4%, a house rent that pays 6% or 6.5% on the total building cost might be a good profit for the builder. If the interest rate is 5%, it might need to be 7% or 7.5%. If builders are making way more money than this, other businesses will start taking their money, bringing profits back down. If they’re making less, money will flow back into building, raising profits again.
