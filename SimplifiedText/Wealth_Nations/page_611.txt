The Wealth of Nations

The East India Company was not happy about a plan to let more people trade, saying it would cause problems. They claimed that competition made prices so high in India that goods weren't worth buying. In England, they said too many goods were available, which made prices drop so low that no one could make money.

It's likely that having more goods would lower prices in England, but it’s hard to believe it would raise prices in India. Any extra demand from competition would be tiny compared to the huge Indian market. While demand might raise prices at first, it usually lowers them over time. More demand encourages more production, which leads to more competition among producers. To beat each other’s prices, they come up with new ways to make things better and cheaper. The problems the company complained about were actually good things: cheaper prices for consumers and more production, which is what economics aims for.

However, the competition they were worried about didn’t last long. In 1702, the two companies joined together with the queen’s help. By 1708, they became one company called the United Company of Merchants trading to the East Indies. The law allowed smaller traders to keep trading until 1711, but it also gave the directors the power to combine all the money into one big fund after three years. 

The company’s money increased from two million to three million two hundred thousand pounds because of a new loan to the government. In 1743, they lent another million to the government. But since this money came from selling bonds instead of asking the owners for more cash, it didn’t increase the amount of money the owners could earn from profits. Still, it did add to the money they could use for trading, which was at risk just like the other three million two hundred thousand pounds from losses and debts the company had.
