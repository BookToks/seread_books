The Wealth of Nations

Next, I will explain what factors naturally decide how much profit people can make and how these factors change based on society's situation.

Even though pay and profit can be very different in various jobs and businesses, there seems to be a common balance between the pay for different jobs and the profits from different businesses. This balance depends on the type of jobs and the laws and rules of the society where they happen. However, this balance doesn’t seem to change much based on whether a society is rich or poor, or whether it's growing, stable, or declining. It usually stays about the same in all these different situations. I will also explain the different factors that control this balance.

Finally, I will show what factors affect land rent and how they can raise or lower the real price of everything that comes from the land.

CHAPTER VIII

THE WAGES OF LABOUR

The results of labour are the natural pay for workers.

In the beginning, before land was owned and wealth was built up, all the results of a worker's effort belonged to that worker. They didn't have to share with a landlord or boss.

If this situation had continued, workers' pay would have increased with improvements in how productive they could be, thanks to dividing up tasks. Over time, everything would have become cheaper. It would take less work to produce things, and since items produced by the same amount of work would be traded for each other, they would also cost less.

However, even if things became cheaper in reality, some items might seem more expensive than before or could be traded for more of other goods. For example, let’s say that in most jobs, the productivity of workers improved ten times.
