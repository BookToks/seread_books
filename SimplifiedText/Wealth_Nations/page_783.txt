The East India Company took control of some territories, which the British government believed could help them earn more money. These places are thought to be more fertile and richer than Great Britain.

If Great Britain can't make more money from these resources, the only option left is to cut down on spending. While there is still room to improve how they collect and spend money, Great Britain is already doing as well as, or better than, other countries. The military costs for protecting the country during peace are lower than those of other wealthy European nations.

If those wars hadn't happened, that debt might have been paid off by now.
