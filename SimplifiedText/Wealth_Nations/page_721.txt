The Wealth of Nations

First, this way of taxing people means they would pay for a license to buy certain goods every year, every six months, or every three months. This would take away one of the main benefits of taxes on goods that people buy quickly: paying little by little. For example, if a pot of beer costs three and a half pence, the taxes on the ingredients and the extra money the brewer makes might add up to about three halfpence. If a worker can afford that three halfpence, he buys the beer. If not, he settles for a pint instead. By saving a penny, he gains a little money by not drinking as much. He pays the tax little by little, whenever he can, and he can choose not to buy it if he wants.

Second, these taxes wouldn’t act like laws that tell people how much they can drink. Once someone buys the license, it doesn’t matter if they drink a lot or a little; the tax stays the same. Third, if a worker had to pay all at once, like once a year or every few months, it could really stress him out. This way of taxing wouldn’t work well without causing a lot of problems, compared to the current way, which doesn’t cause as much trouble. In some countries, though, people do pay taxes like this for things they use quickly. For example, in Holland, people pay a fee to drink tea. There’s also a tax on bread in some rural areas.

Excise taxes are mainly on goods made in the country that people buy for themselves. They only apply to a few common items. It’s clear which goods have these taxes and how much each one costs. Most of these taxes are on luxuries, except for a few like salt, soap, leather, candles, and maybe green glass. Customs duties are older than excise taxes. They were called customs because they were payments that had been around for a long time. They were originally seen as taxes on what merchants made. Back in the rough times of feudalism, merchants were looked down upon and their profits were envied, just like everyone else living in towns. The wealthy nobles...
