Adam Smith

The price of grain was set at 6d. per quarter. By the time of William and Mary, a law was passed that basically removed this small tax whenever wheat prices were below 48s. per quarter. Later, another law made it clear that the tax was completely removed when prices went higher.

This made it easier for merchants who exported goods to do business compared to those selling within the country. According to the last law, corn could be bought at any price for export, but it couldn’t be bought for local sale unless the price was under 48s. However, the interests of local sellers usually matched what most people needed. On the other hand, exporters sometimes had different interests. If there was a shortage in their own country but a neighboring country was facing a famine, they might choose to sell corn to the neighboring country, making things worse for their own people.

The laws weren’t really aimed at making sure there was enough corn for everyone at home. Instead, they pretended to support farming while actually trying to raise corn prices as high as possible, which led to constant shortages. By stopping imports, the supply at home was limited to what was grown locally, even during tough times. And by encouraging exports when prices were high, the local market didn’t get to benefit fully from the crops that were available. The temporary laws that sometimes stopped corn exports or lowered import taxes showed that the overall system wasn’t working well. If it had been good, the country wouldn’t have had to keep changing it.

If all countries allowed free trade for exporting and importing, different regions of a big continent would work more like parts of a single empire. Just like in a big empire, allowing free trade would help ease shortages and prevent famines across different regions. The bigger the continent, the easier it would be to connect all its parts by land and water, making it less likely for any one area to face these problems, since one region's surplus could help another's shortage.
