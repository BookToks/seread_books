The Wealth of Nations

Sometimes, people think it's okay to ignore an individual's rights for the sake of other interests. But the fairness of the law is really important for everyone's freedom and safety. To make sure everyone feels safe and secure in their rights, we need to keep judges separate from the government. Judges should not be easily removed from their jobs just because someone in power wants them gone. Their pay should not depend on whether the government feels like being generous or not.

The third main job of the government is to create and maintain public services and projects. These projects are super important for society, but they usually cost more than any one person or small group can afford. So, it's not fair to expect just a few people to pay for them. The costs for these projects can change a lot depending on how society is doing at the time.

After we take care of public services that keep everyone safe and ensure justice, the other important projects mainly help with trade and education. There are two types of educational institutions: those for teaching young people and those for teaching everyone, no matter their age. We will look at how to pay for these different public services and projects in the next part of this chapter.
