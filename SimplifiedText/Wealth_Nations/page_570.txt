Soldiers in a militia usually have other jobs to support themselves. In a militia, people are more like workers or tradesmen than soldiers. But in a regular army, being a soldier is the main focus. This is the key difference between these two types of military forces.

Militias come in different forms. In some places, citizens who are supposed to defend their country train on their own, without being organized into specific groups. For example, in ancient Greece and Rome, citizens practiced their skills either alone or with friends, and they only joined a specific group when they were needed. In other countries, militias are more organized. In places like England and Switzerland, every militia member belongs to a specific group, even when thereâ€™s no war, and they train together under permanent leaders.

Before guns were invented, the best army was the one with the most skilled soldiers. Strength and quickness were really important and often decided who won battles. Back then, soldiers learned their skills by training individually, like how people learn fencing today. But after guns were invented, being strong or quick became less important. While skill still matters, the way guns work means that even less skilled people can compete better than before. Most of the skills needed to use guns can be learned by training in larger groups.

In modern armies, being organized, following orders, and working together are more important for winning battles than just being skilled with weapons. The loud noise of guns, the smoke, and the constant danger of being hit make every soldier feel at risk as soon as they get close to the enemy.
