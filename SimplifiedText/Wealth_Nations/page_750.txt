Adam Smith

When a government spends more money than it needs to keep the country safe, it has to rely on its citizens for extra help. Usually, a government’s spending matches its income, but sometimes it goes over. It’s hard to save up money, and since the time of Henry IV of France, only a few kings in Europe, like the recent kings of Prussia, have managed to save a lot. Most governments, whether they are republics or monarchies, are in debt. For example, the Italian republics and the Netherlands owe money. The only Swiss republic that has saved a lot is Berne; the others haven’t. Even small republics often want fancy buildings and decorations, just like big kings do.

When a country doesn’t save money during peaceful times, it has to borrow when war starts. In peacetime, the government only keeps enough money for regular expenses. But in war, it needs three or four times more money to defend itself. Even if a ruler has a way to raise more money quickly, it usually takes about ten or twelve months for new taxes to bring in cash. As soon as war seems likely, the army needs to grow, the navy needs to be ready, and towns need to be defended. This means spending a lot of money right away for weapons, food, and supplies, which can’t wait for the slow arrival of new tax money. So, the government has to borrow money.

The way society works, with lots of businesses and trade, makes it necessary for the government to borrow money, but it also means that people are willing and able to lend money. A country with many merchants and manufacturers has plenty of people who can help out financially.
