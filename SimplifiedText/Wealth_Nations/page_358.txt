People often get jealous of those who have special support from their governments. This jealousy makes them think that these people's trade is bad because it sends a lot of silver out of their countries every year. The traders respond by saying that while their trade might seem to take away silver from Europe, it actually benefits their own country. They argue that by sending some of the silver back to other European countries, they bring back even more silver than they send out.

Both the complaints and the answers are based on a common idea that I just talked about. So, I don’t need to say more about that. When silver is sent to the East Indies, it might make silver items a bit more expensive in Europe. However, this is a small problem, and it also means that silver can buy more work and goods. The extra cost is minor, and the benefit is also small, so they aren’t really worth worrying about.

Trading with the East Indies helps sell European goods, or even the gold and silver bought with those goods. This trade should help increase the production of European goods and, in turn, the real wealth of Europe. The reason it hasn’t helped much so far is probably because of the many restrictions on trade.

I wanted to take the time to explain this common idea that wealth is just money or gold and silver. People often use the word "money" to mean wealth, which makes this idea seem normal. Even those who know it’s not true can forget their own beliefs and treat it like a fact when they think about it. Some smart writers about trade say that a country’s wealth isn’t just in gold and silver but also in land, houses, and all kinds of goods. But during their discussions, they often forget about land and houses, and their arguments end up suggesting that all wealth is just gold and silver, and that getting more of those metals is the main goal of a country’s trade and work.

Once we accept the ideas that wealth is in gold and silver and that countries without mines can only get those metals by trading more than they buy, it leads to a certain conclusion.
