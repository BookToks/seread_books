The Wealth of Nations

The discovery of America and the route to the East Indies around Africa are two of the biggest events in human history. They have already had a huge impact, but since these discoveries happened only about 200 to 300 years ago, we can’t fully understand all their effects yet. We can’t predict what good or bad things might come from these events in the future. 

These discoveries connected faraway parts of the world, allowing people to help each other, enjoy more things, and work together. This seems like a good thing overall. However, for the native people in the East and West Indies, the positive effects have been overshadowed by terrible hardships that came from these events. These hardships were more due to chance than the events themselves. When these discoveries were made, Europeans had a lot more power, which let them do many unfair things in those distant lands. 

In the future, the native people might become stronger, or Europeans might become weaker. If that happens, people from all over the world could reach a balance of strength that makes everyone respect each other’s rights. This balance is more likely to happen through sharing knowledge and improvements that come from trade between countries. 

In the meantime, one major effect of these discoveries has been to make trade and business much more important than they were before. The goal of this system is to make a nation rich through trade and manufacturing instead of just farming. Because of these discoveries, European trading towns are no longer just serving a small part of the world. They now supply many thriving farmers in America and trade with countries in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Two new worlds have opened up for their businesses, each offering a lot of opportunities.
