The city of Amsterdam makes a lot of money from its bank. When someone first opens an account, they have to pay a fee of ten guilders. For every new account after that, it costs three guilders and three stivers. If you want to transfer money, it costs two stivers, but if the transfer is for less than 300 guilders, it costs six stivers to stop people from making too many small transactions. If someone forgets to check their account balance twice a year, they lose twenty-five guilders. If you try to take out more money than you have, you have to pay three percent on the extra amount, and your request gets canceled. 

The bank also makes money by selling foreign coins it gets when receipts expire, and it waits until it can sell them for a good price. It profits by selling bank money for five percent more than it buys it for at four percent. All these ways of making money add up to much more than what they need to pay their staff and cover other costs. Just keeping the bullion on receipts is thought to bring in between 150,000 and 200,000 guilders each year.

However, the main goal of the bank was to help merchants avoid problems with bad exchange rates, not to make money. The profits were unexpected and can be seen as a bonus. Now, letâ€™s get back to why the exchange rates between countries that use bank money and those that use regular money usually favor the bank money users. The first group uses a type of money that always has the same value, while the second group uses money that changes in value and is often worth less than it should be.

In the earlier part of this chapter, I tried to explain how silly it is to put extra limits on importing goods from countries where trade is thought to be unfair. Nothing is more ridiculous than this whole idea.
