The Wealth of Nations

The way people work and how much they get paid depends on what society needs. When it comes to free workers and slaves, free workers usually cost less to maintain. A free worker takes care of their own needs, while a slave's needs are often overlooked by their owner. 

Rich people often manage their workers poorly, while poor people are usually careful with their money. Because of this, the same job can end up costing very different amounts depending on who is doing it. History shows that hiring free workers is cheaper in the long run than using slaves, even in cities like Boston, New York, and Philadelphia where pay is high.

Good pay for work leads to more people living in a place. Complaining about high wages is silly because they are a sign of a thriving society. 

It's interesting to note that when a society is growing and getting richer, the working class tends to be happier and more comfortable. When a society is stagnant or getting poorer, life is much harder. A growing society is lively and energetic, while a stagnant one feels boring and a declining one feels sad.

Good pay not only helps people support their families but also makes them work harder. When workers earn more, they feel stronger and more hopeful about improving their lives. This motivates them to work as hard as they can. In places where wages are high, workers are usually more active and efficient compared to places with low wages. For example, workers in England tend to be more productive than those in Scotland, and workers near big cities are often busier than those in the countryside. Some workers might take it easy if they can make enough money in just a few days, but most workers are motivated to keep going.
