The Wealth of Nations

If someone doesn’t follow the rules, the law says they have to leave the area. But such a strict law wouldn’t work in free countries if the church hadn’t already convinced most people to join their religion, except for maybe a few. In some parts of Switzerland, where a Protestant and a Catholic area came together, both religions are accepted and even supported by law.

To do any job well, the pay should match the work. If a job pays too little, the workers might not do a good job because they feel undervalued. If a job pays too much, workers might get lazy and not care about their work. A person who makes a lot of money usually thinks they should live like others who have a lot of money, spending time on fun and luxury. But for a clergyman, living this way takes away time from their important duties and makes people lose respect for them, which is crucial for doing their job well.

To keep the dignity of a ruler, there are extra costs on top of what they need to do their job. This cost changes depending on the time and type of government.

In a wealthy society, where everyone is spending more on their homes, clothes, and lifestyles, it’s not fair to expect the ruler to live differently. They end up spending more too, just to keep up with what’s expected of them. A king’s position is seen as higher than that of a leader in a republic, so they need to spend more to show that status. We naturally expect a king’s court to be more extravagant than the home of a city leader.
