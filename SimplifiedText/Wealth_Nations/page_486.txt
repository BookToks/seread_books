First, the colonies' control over trade has always made some money from Great Britain move away from nearby countries to faraway places. 

This means that money that could be used for trade with Europe and Mediterranean countries is instead used for trade with America and the West Indies. The returns from these distant places happen less often because they are far away and have their own unique situations. 

New colonies usually don’t have enough resources. They always need more money than they have to improve and farm their land. So, they try to borrow as much money as they can from their mother country, which means they are always in debt. 

Most of the time, colonies don’t borrow money directly from rich people in Britain, although they do that sometimes. Instead, they owe money to suppliers in Europe who send them goods. Often, the money they make in a year is only about a third of what they owe. 

This means that the money their suppliers give them usually doesn’t get paid back to Britain for three to five years. For example, if a British capital of a thousand pounds is only sent back every five years, it can only support one-fifth of the British jobs it could if it came back every year. 

So, instead of supporting a full year’s worth of jobs, that thousand pounds can only support what two hundred pounds would support in a year. The planter pays a lot for goods from Europe, plus interest on delayed payments, and fees for renewing those payments. This might cover the losses for the supplier, but it doesn’t help Great Britain. 

In trades where returns take a long time, the merchant might make just as much or even more profit than in trades where returns are quick. However, the overall benefit for the country where the merchant lives, like the amount of work available and the yearly production of land, is not the same.
