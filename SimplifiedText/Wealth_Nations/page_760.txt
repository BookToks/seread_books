Adam Smith was not happy when peace returned because it ended the excitement of war and all the dreams of winning and national pride that came with it. 

Even when peace comes, people usually still have to pay many of the taxes that were put in place during the war. These taxes are used to pay off the debt that was created to keep the war going. If, after paying this debt and the regular costs of running the government, there’s some extra money from old and new taxes, it might be used to help pay off the debt. But first, this extra money usually isn’t enough to pay off the entire debt from the war in the time we expect peace to last. Also, this extra money often gets used for other things instead.

The new taxes were created just to pay the interest on the money borrowed. If they bring in more money than expected, it’s usually not a lot and wasn’t planned for. Most sinking funds, which are meant to pay off debt, come from lowering the interest rates rather than from extra tax money. For example, this happened in Holland in 1655 and in the ecclesiastical state in 1685. That’s why these funds often don’t have enough money.

Even during peaceful times, unexpected events can happen that need extra money. Governments often find it easier to use the sinking fund for these expenses instead of creating new taxes. New taxes are always felt by the people and cause complaints and pushback. The more taxes there are, and the higher they are, the more people complain about them, making it harder to find new ways to tax or raise existing taxes. If the government temporarily stops paying off debt, people usually don’t notice right away, and it doesn’t cause complaints. Borrowing from the sinking fund seems like an easy way to solve immediate problems. 

But the more public debt there is, the more important it becomes to reduce it. Misusing any part of the sinking fund can be very risky and harmful, making it less likely that the public debt will be reduced significantly.
