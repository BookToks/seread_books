almost all the Scottish banks. 

The main reason for too much paper money in the UK was some people taking big risks in business. 

A bank should only lend a merchant or business person a small amount of money, not all of their trading money. They should only lend what the merchant needs to keep on hand for unexpected costs. If the bank keeps its loans within this limit, it won’t give out more paper money than the gold and silver that would normally be used if there was no paper money. 

When a bank gives a merchant a loan based on a real bill of exchange, which is a promise for payment from one person to another, it’s just giving them part of the money they would usually keep on hand. When the bill is paid, the bank gets back what it lent, plus interest. The bank’s money situation is like a pond that stays full; even though money goes out, just as much comes back in, so it doesn’t need extra effort to keep it filled. 

A merchant might need cash sometimes, even if they don’t have bills to turn in. When a bank helps by giving them cash and allows them to pay it back slowly as they sell their goods, the merchant doesn’t have to keep extra money on hand for unexpected costs. They can use their cash account to cover those needs. However, the bank needs to pay close attention to whether the money it gets back from these customers matches what it has lent them over a few months. If the repayments are usually equal to the loans, then everything is working well.
