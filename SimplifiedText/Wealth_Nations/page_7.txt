The Wealth of Nations

INTRODUCTION

Every country’s work is what gives it all the things people need and want to live. This includes what people make themselves and what they buy from other countries. 

How well a country can provide for its people depends on how much stuff is produced compared to how many people need it. If there’s a lot of stuff for everyone, then people are better off. But this balance is influenced by two main things: first, how skilled and smart the workers are, and second, how many people are working compared to those who aren’t working. 

No matter the land or weather of a country, how much it has to offer depends on these two factors. Usually, the skills of the workers matter more than the number of workers. In groups of hunters and fishers, everyone who can work tries to help out and provide for themselves and their families, especially for those who can’t hunt or fish. 

However, these groups are often very poor. Because they don’t have enough food, they sometimes feel forced to abandon or even harm their babies, elderly, or sick family members.
