Adam Smith talks about how companies work and how they manage their trade and resources. 

Some companies, especially those with forts and garrisons, might actually benefit from a decline in general trade. This is because fewer competitors can help them buy things cheaper and sell them for more money. 

Directors of a joint-stock company, which is a type of business, only get a share of the profits from the company's overall earnings. They don’t have their own separate business interests. Their success is tied to how well the whole company does, including keeping the forts and garrisons safe. Because of this, they pay more attention to making sure these places are well-maintained.

On the other hand, directors of a regulated company don’t manage a common pool of money. They can only use the money that comes from fees and duties related to their trade. Even if they want to maintain forts and garrisons, they often don’t have enough resources to do it effectively. 

Maintaining a public minister is easier and requires less attention and money, making it a better fit for a regulated company.

Later, in 1750, a new regulated company was created for merchants trading to Africa. This company was responsible for maintaining British forts and garrisons from Cape Blanc to the Cape of Good Hope. The law that set up this company had two main goals: to stop the directors from being too controlling and to encourage them to pay more attention to maintaining the forts and garrisons.

To help with the first goal, the admission fee was set at a maximum of forty shillings. The company was not allowed to trade as a group or borrow money using their official seal. They also couldn’t put restrictions on trade, which had to be open for everyone.
