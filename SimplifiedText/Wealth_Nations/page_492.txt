Adam Smith

To keep making more stuff to trade, we need to keep finding new things to exchange. When the colony trade is free and natural, it helps increase the amount of work in Great Britain without changing how that work was done before. In a free colony trade, competition from other countries stops profits from getting too high, whether in the new market or the new jobs. The new market doesn’t take anything from the old one; it creates new products just for itself. These new products then become new resources to support the new jobs, which also don’t take anything from the old jobs.

But when there’s a monopoly on the colony trade, it keeps other countries from competing. This raises profits in the new market and new jobs but takes resources from the old market and old jobs. The goal of the monopoly is to increase our share of the colony trade beyond what it would normally be. If our share didn’t grow with the monopoly, there would be no reason to have it. When more money is forced into a trade that takes longer to pay off than most others, it means less overall work and production in that country than there could be. This keeps the income of people in that country lower than it could be, which makes it harder for them to save money. It not only limits how much work can be supported but also slows down how fast it can grow, meaning even less work can be supported in the future.

However, the good things that come from the colony trade outweigh the bad effects of the monopoly for Great Britain. So even with the monopoly, the trade is still very beneficial. The new market and jobs created by the colony trade are much bigger than the parts of the old market and jobs that are lost because of the monopoly. The new products and resources created by the colony trade support more work in Great Britain than what was lost.
