In 1774, the government collected a lot of money from taxes. They got £1,246,373 from different sources, including £320,601 from a brewery in London. 

In 1775, the total tax collected was £1,214,583, with the London brewery contributing £463,670. Over four years, the average tax collected was £1,636,958. If you add in the average tax from malt, which was £958,895, the total from all these taxes came to £2,595,835.

If the malt tax was tripled, raising it from six to eighteen shillings for a quarter of malt, it could bring in £2,876,685. That’s £280,832 more than the previous total. The old malt tax also included a £4 tax on a hogshead of cider and a £10 tax on a barrel of mum (a type of beer). In 1774, the cider tax only made £3,083, which was less than usual. The mum tax was heavier, but it didn’t bring in much money because not many people drank it.

The country excise tax also included other taxes, like six shillings and eight pence on a hogshead of cider, the same amount on verjuice, eight shillings and nine pence on vinegar, and eleven pence on a gallon of mead. These taxes likely made more money than the cider and mum taxes combined.

Malt is used not just for beer but also for making spirits. If the malt tax goes up to eighteen shillings, they might need to lower some other taxes on spirits made from malt. In malt spirits, malt usually makes up about a third of the ingredients, with the rest being barley or a mix of barley and wheat. Making malt spirits has more chances and reasons for people to smuggle compared to brewing beer, because the spirits are smaller and worth more, and the taxes on them are higher.
