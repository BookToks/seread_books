Adam Smith talks about how some types of farming can produce more food than others. For example, rice fields can grow a lot more food than corn fields. In a good rice field, farmers can get two harvests a year, usually around thirty to sixty bushels each time. Even though growing rice takes more work, there’s still more leftover food after paying for all that labor. 

In places where rice is the main food, the landlord gets a bigger share of this extra food compared to places that grow corn. In Carolina, where the people who grow rice are also the ones who own the land, rice farming is more profitable than corn farming, even though they only get one harvest a year and rice isn’t the favorite food there.

Rice fields are often wet and muddy, making them unsuitable for growing corn, grass, or grapes. The land that works well for those crops isn’t good for rice. So, in rice-growing areas, the rent for rice fields doesn’t really affect the rent for other types of farmland.

When it comes to potatoes, they can produce just as much food as rice and even more than wheat. An acre of potatoes can yield around twelve thousand pounds, while an acre of wheat only gives about two thousand pounds. Potatoes have a lot of water in them, so if we count that, an acre of potatoes still gives about six thousand pounds of solid food, which is three times more than wheat. Plus, it costs less to grow potatoes than wheat because you don’t need to spend as much time preparing the land. If potatoes ever become as popular as rice in some places, they could really change the way people think about food.
