Adam Smith says that in some places, people earn more money and food costs less than in England. Because of this, most people should be able to buy more things if they want to. So, the lack of gold and silver must be a choice, not because they need it.

Gold and silver are useful for doing business, whether at home or with other countries. In peaceful times, people can use paper money instead of gold and silver for everyday transactions. For Americans, it makes sense to save money by not using expensive gold and silver. Instead, they can use that money to buy things like tools, clothes, furniture, and materials to build their homes and farms. They want to invest in things that help them grow and make more money.

The governments in the colonies find it helpful to provide enough paper money for people to do their business. For example, Pennsylvania makes money by lending paper money to its people at interest. Other places, like Massachusetts Bay, create paper money during emergencies to cover public expenses and then pay it back later when it’s convenient, even if it’s worth less over time. In 1747, Massachusetts paid off most of its public debts using only a small fraction of the money that was originally issued.

Using paper money helps farmers save money instead of using gold and silver for their everyday needs. It also helps the colony governments because they can provide a way for people to trade without the high costs of precious metals. In both the colonies and Scotland, the use of too much paper money has pushed gold and silver out of everyday transactions. It's not because people are poor; it’s because they want to use all their resources to grow and succeed.
