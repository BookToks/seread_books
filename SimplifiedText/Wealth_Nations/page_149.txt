The Wealth of Nations

The Spaniards would not have been shocked by this.

Part III — About how the value of different types of produce changes, especially those that can sometimes earn rent and those that always do.

As food becomes more available because of better farming and land use, people will want more of everything else that comes from the land, whether it’s useful or just for decoration. Because of this, we would expect that the value of things that sometimes earn rent should go up compared to things that always earn rent. As art and industry grow, things like clothing materials, useful minerals, precious metals, and gemstones should become more popular and trade for more food over time. This has happened with most of these items most of the time, but sometimes unexpected events can cause an oversupply of certain things, making their value drop.

For example, the value of a stone quarry will go up as the area around it gets better and more people move in, especially if it’s the only one nearby. But the value of a silver mine might not go up just because the area is improving, even if it’s the only one for miles. The market for stone from a quarry usually only covers a small area, so demand depends on how many people live nearby. However, the market for silver can reach all over the world. So, if the world isn’t improving, the demand for silver might not go up even if a big country nearby is getting better. 

Even if the world is improving, if new silver mines are found that are much richer than the old ones, the supply of silver could increase so much that its price might actually go down. This means that even if people want more silver, if there’s way more of it available, the price for a pound of silver could gradually drop.
