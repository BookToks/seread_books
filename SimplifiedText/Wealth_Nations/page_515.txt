The Wealth of Nations talks about how some colonies in America are doing well. But Africa and some places in the East Indies are home to wild tribes. These tribes aren’t as weak as the Native Americans, who were often helpless. In fact, the people in Africa and the East Indies are more numerous and live in more fertile areas. The wild tribes in Africa and the East Indies mostly raised animals, while most Native Americans, except those in Mexico and Peru, were just hunters. There’s a big difference in how many people can live off raising animals compared to hunting.

Because of this, it was harder for Europeans to take over land in Africa and the East Indies compared to America. Also, the way exclusive trading companies work isn’t great for starting new colonies, which is why there hasn’t been much growth in the East Indies. The Portuguese traded with Africa and the East Indies without these exclusive companies. Their settlements in places like Congo, Angola, and Goa, though facing many problems, are somewhat similar to American colonies and have Portuguese people living there for generations.

The Dutch have important colonies at the Cape of Good Hope and Batavia. These places are well-located. The Cape of Good Hope was home to people who were almost as defenseless as Native Americans. It’s also a key stop for European ships traveling to the East Indies, where they can get fresh food and supplies. This creates a big market for the extra goods from the colonies.

Batavia is like the Cape of Good Hope but for the East Indies. It’s located on the busiest route from India to China and Japan, making it a central spot for ships traveling between Europe and China. Batavia is also the main trading hub for both Europeans and local Indians in the East Indies.
