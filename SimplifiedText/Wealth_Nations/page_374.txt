Adam Smith

If a lot of people suddenly lost their jobs, it might cause some chaos. But it probably wouldn’t be as bad as most people think for two main reasons.

First, the businesses that sell products to other European countries without needing extra help wouldn’t be affected much by letting in foreign goods. These businesses have to sell their products at prices that are competitive with foreign goods. This means they would have to sell them cheaper at home. So, they would still have customers in their own country. Even if some trendy people decided to buy foreign stuff just because it’s foreign, this wouldn’t really change things for most people. A lot of our wool products, tanned leather, and hardware are sold to other European countries without any extra support, and these are the businesses that employ the most people. The silk industry might be the one that gets hit the hardest by free trade, and the linen industry would be affected too, but not as much.

Second, even if a lot of people lost their usual jobs because of free trade, it doesn’t mean they wouldn’t find new jobs or ways to make a living. After the last war, over 100,000 soldiers and sailors suddenly found themselves without work. Even though it was tough for them, they didn’t lose all chances of finding jobs. Many of the sailors probably found work on merchant ships, and both the sailors and soldiers eventually blended back into the workforce and found different jobs. There wasn’t a huge crisis or noticeable chaos from this big change, even with so many people used to military life. The number of homeless people didn’t really go up, and wages didn’t drop for most jobs, except for sailors in the merchant service. If we look at how soldiers and manufacturers work, we can see that manufacturers are usually better at adapting to new jobs than soldiers are.
