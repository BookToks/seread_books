Adam Smith

The real cost of silver is pretty much the same in both places, but the cost of corn is very different. If we reduce the wealth of either Holland or Genoa, while the number of people stays the same, and if they can’t get supplies from other countries, the price of corn will go up instead of down. This happens even if the amount of silver they have goes down. When we really need things, we have to get rid of all the extra stuff we don’t need. The value of those extras goes up when times are good, but it goes down when times are tough. Necessities, like corn, are different. Their real price goes up when times are hard and goes down when times are good, which are usually times when there’s a lot of food. Corn is essential, but silver is just extra.

So, even if the amount of precious metals increased between the mid-1300s and the mid-1500s because of more wealth and improvements, it didn’t make their value go down in Great Britain or anywhere else in Europe. People who looked at prices back then had no reason to think that silver’s value dropped based on the prices of corn or other goods. They had even less reason to think it dropped because of any supposed increase in wealth.

During the second period, from about 1570 to 1640, everyone agrees on how the value of silver changed. For about seventy years, the value of silver went down, meaning it could buy less labor than before. At the same time, the price of corn went up. Instead of being sold for about two ounces of silver, or ten shillings today, it started selling for six to eight ounces of silver, or thirty to forty shillings today.

The discovery of rich silver mines in America seems to be the main reason for this drop in silver's value compared to corn. Everyone agrees on this, and there’s been no argument about the fact or the reason behind it. The more silver that was found...
