In the years leading up to 1620, things changed a lot, especially after a big discovery. For the first sixty-four years of this century, the average price of wheat was about thirty-two shillings for eight bushels.

It looks like the value of silver went up compared to corn during this century, and it probably started happening even before the last century ended.

In 1687, the price for nine bushels of the best wheat at Windsor market was £1:5:2, which was the lowest price since 1595. 

In 1688, a guy named Mr. Gregory King, who knew a lot about this stuff, said that in good years, the average price for wheat was about 3 shillings and 6 pence per bushel, or twenty-eight shillings for a quarter. The grower’s price is what farmers agree to sell their wheat for over a few years to a dealer. This price is usually lower than what you’d see in the market because it saves farmers the hassle of selling it themselves. Mr. King thought twenty-eight shillings was a normal price during good years. Before the recent bad seasons, this was the usual price in regular years.

In 1688, the government decided to give money to help farmers export corn. The country gentlemen in the government noticed that corn prices were dropping. They wanted to raise the price back up to what it used to be during the reigns of Charles I and II. They planned to keep this going until the price of wheat reached forty-eight shillings for a quarter, which was twenty shillings more than what Mr. King thought was a fair price in good years. If Mr. King’s estimates were accurate, forty-eight shillings was a price that wouldn’t happen without some help, except in really bad years. But at that time, King William’s government was still getting settled and needed support from the country gentlemen, who were also helping to set up a new land tax.
