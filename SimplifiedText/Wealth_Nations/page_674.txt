When land is well taken care of and makes a lot of money when sold, it usually sells for about thirty times its yearly rent. On the other hand, land that isnâ€™t improved or makes less money might sell for forty, fifty, or even sixty times its yearly rent. The government could use the money from selling this land to pay off debts right away. In a few years, they would likely make even more money from it. Once the government land becomes private property, it would get better and more productive over time. This increase in production would help the country grow by boosting the income and spending of its people. As people earn and spend more, the government would also earn more from taxes.

In any civilized country, the money the government makes from its lands might seem free for individuals, but it actually costs society a lot more than other types of income the government has. It would be better for society if they replaced this income with something else and shared the land among the people, perhaps by selling it to the public.

Lands that are used for enjoyment, like parks and gardens, are seen as costs rather than ways to make money. These types of lands should be the only ones that the government owns in a big, civilized country.

So, public money and lands are not enough to cover the expenses of a large and developed state. Most of the costs need to be paid through taxes, meaning people have to give up some of their own money to help support the government.
