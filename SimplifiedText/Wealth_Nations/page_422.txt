The problems with crops usually happen because of too much drought or too much rain. Corn can grow in both high and low areas, and while one part of the country might suffer from drought, another part might benefit from the rain. Even though the overall crop yield is lower during wet or dry seasons, what one area loses can be balanced out by what another area gains.

In places that grow rice, the situation is worse during droughts because rice needs a lot of water, and sometimes it even has to be underwater for a while. However, even in these areas, a drought usually doesn’t lead to famine if the government allows free trade. For example, a drought in Bengal a few years back could have caused a big food shortage, but some bad rules by the East India Company made it worse and turned it into a famine.

When the government tries to fix food shortages by forcing sellers to sell at a certain price, it can actually make things worse. This can stop sellers from bringing food to the market, which might cause a famine early in the season. If they do bring food, people might buy it up too quickly, leading to a famine before the season ends. Allowing free trade in corn is the best way to prevent famine and help during food shortages because real scarcity can’t be fixed, only eased.

During tough times, people often blame corn merchants for their problems and get angry at them. Instead of making money, these merchants can end up in serious trouble, with their supplies being stolen or destroyed. However, in years when food is scarce and prices are high, corn merchants actually expect to make their biggest profits. They usually have contracts with farmers to buy a set amount of corn at a set price, which is based on what is considered a fair price. Before recent years of shortages, this price was about 28 shillings for a quarter of wheat, and other grains were priced similarly. So, in tough years, the corn merchant's situation becomes complicated.
