Adam Smith talks about how to protect different parts of trade. If a specific part of trade needs protection, it could be funded by a small tax on that trade. For example, traders could pay a small fee when they start or a percentage tax on the goods they bring in or send out. The idea is that protecting trade from pirates and robbers led to the creation of customs duties. If it's fair to tax all trade to cover general protection costs, it makes sense to tax specific trades to cover their unique protection costs.

Protecting trade is seen as super important for the country, so it's a job for the government. The government usually collects and uses these general customs duties. Protecting specific trades is part of protecting trade overall, so it should also be the government's job. However, countries often don’t act consistently. In many European countries, certain groups of merchants convinced the government to let them handle this responsibility, along with the powers that come with it.

These merchant groups might have helped start some types of trade by taking risks that the government wasn’t ready to take. But over time, they often became a burden or didn’t help much at all, and they sometimes messed up or limited trade. 

When these groups don’t pool their money together but allow anyone qualified to join by paying a fee and following the rules, they are called regulated companies. When they do pool their money and share profits or losses based on their investment, they are called joint-stock companies. Both types of companies can have special privileges, but sometimes they don’t. Regulated companies are similar to trade groups found in many cities and towns.
