The Wealth of Nations talks about how quickly people can get money from bills, especially when they are due in just two or three months. If someone who promised to pay (the acceptor) doesn’t pay when the bill is presented, they are considered bankrupt right away. The bill then goes back to the person who originally wrote it (the drawer), and if they don’t pay immediately, they also become bankrupt.

If the bill has changed hands several times before reaching the acceptor, each person who handled it has written their name on the back. Each of these people is also responsible for paying the bill. If they don’t pay, they too become bankrupt. Even if the people involved are not very trustworthy, the short time frame gives some security to the person who owns the bill. It’s like a traveler thinking the house they are in might fall down, but deciding to sleep there anyway because it might not happen tonight.

Let’s say trader A in Edinburgh writes a bill to B in London, due in two months. B doesn’t actually owe A any money, but agrees to accept the bill if he can write another bill back to A for the same amount plus extra fees, also due in two months. B then writes this new bill before the first two months are up. A does the same thing again, writing another bill to B, and this keeps going back and forth.

This can happen for months or even years, with each new bill adding up the interest and fees from the previous ones. The interest is usually five percent a year, and the fees are at least half a percent each time. If this happens more than six times a year, A ends up paying more than eight percent a year, and sometimes a lot more, especially if the fees go up or if he has to pay interest on the interest.
