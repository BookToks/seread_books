Adam Smith talks about how people can suffer if there’s not enough food, especially at the end of the season. He believes it’s important for everyone to get the right amount of food based on what’s available. This is also true for corn dealers. If they can figure out how much food people need, they can sell all their corn for a good price and make a good profit. They know how much corn they have and how much they sell, which helps them understand how to keep things balanced.

Sometimes, corn dealers have to act like a ship captain who has to ration food when supplies are low. Even if they might be too cautious at times, it’s better than risking their crew’s safety. If a corn dealer raises prices too high, it might cause some trouble for people, but it can also help prevent a food shortage later on. If the dealer is too greedy, they might end up with a lot of corn left over at the end of the season, which they’ll have to sell for less money later.

If one big group of merchants had control over all the food in a large area, they might try to raise prices by wasting some of it, like the Dutch did with spices. But it’s really hard to control all the food supply like that, especially when the law allows free trade. Corn is one of those things that’s hard to monopolize because its value is much higher than what a few rich people can buy.
