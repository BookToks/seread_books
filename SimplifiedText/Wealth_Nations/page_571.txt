The Wealth of Nations

In a battle, especially a modern one, it can be really hard to keep things organized and make sure everyone follows orders right from the start. In ancient battles, it was different. There was no loud noise except for people shouting, and no smoke or hidden dangers. Soldiers could see clearly if they were in danger. Because of this, and with soldiers who trusted their skills, it was easier to stay organized and keep fighting until one side won.

However, soldiers need to practice a lot to be good at following orders and staying organized. A militia, which is a group of soldiers that isn’t trained as much, will always be less effective than a professional army that trains regularly. Soldiers who only practice once a week or once a month won’t be as skilled as those who train every day. Even though this might not matter as much now as it did in the past, the success of the Prussian army shows that being well-trained is still really important.

Soldiers who only have to listen to their officers once a week won’t feel the same pressure to obey as those who are directed every day. If a soldier’s daily life is controlled by their officer, they are more likely to follow orders quickly. In terms of discipline and obedience, a militia is usually much weaker than a standing army, even if they can handle their weapons decently. But in modern warfare, being able to follow orders quickly is even more important than just being good with weapons.

Militias that fight under the same leaders they respect in peacetime, like the Tartar or Arab militias, tend to be the best. They are more disciplined and ready to obey, making them closer to professional armies. The Highland militia also performed better when they fought under their own leaders.
