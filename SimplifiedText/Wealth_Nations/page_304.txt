Adam Smith talks about how Great Britain produces a lot of goods, but not all of them are needed at home. They might only need about 14,000 units of a certain product, but they produce 96,000. If they can't sell the extra 82,000 units abroad, they will have to stop making them. This would mean that many people in Britain who work to create these goods would lose their jobs. 

When a country has more products than it can sell at home, it often starts trading with other countries. This trade helps support jobs and keeps the economy going. The carrying trade, which is when goods are transported from one country to another, can be really important for a country's economy. However, just having a lot of trade doesn’t automatically make a country rich; it’s usually a sign that the country is already wealthy. 

For example, Holland is one of the richest countries in Europe and has a big share of the carrying trade. England is also quite wealthy and has a good amount of this trade, but sometimes what people think of as England's carrying trade is just a way of trading goods back and forth. 

Goods from places like the East and West Indies and America are often brought to Europe through this trade. These goods are usually bought with products made in Britain or with money made from those products, and then they are consumed in Britain. The trade that happens between British ships in the Mediterranean and between British merchants in India is a big part of what we call the carrying trade for Great Britain.

The amount of trade that can happen at home is limited by how much extra product is available from different places in the country that want to trade.
