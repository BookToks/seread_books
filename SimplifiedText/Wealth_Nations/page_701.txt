The Wealth of Nations

In some areas of France, like Agen and Condom, there are taxes on land owned in a certain way. In other countries, the tax is based on the profits made by people who farm or lease land that belongs to someone else, no matter how the owner got it. This kind of tax is called a personal tax. Most of the provinces in France that are known as the countries of elections have this type of tax. The real tax only applies to part of the land in the country, so it can be unfair, but it’s not always random. However, the personal tax is meant to match the profits of a specific group of people, which can only be guessed, making it both random and unfair.

As of 1775, the personal tax in France adds up to over 40 million livres each year for the twenty generalities, known as the countries of elections. The way this tax is divided among different provinces changes every year based on reports to the king’s council about how good or bad the crops are and other factors that might affect how much people can pay. Each generality is split into several elections, and the way the total tax is shared among these elections also changes yearly, depending on the council’s reports about their ability to pay.

It seems impossible for the council, even if they try their best, to fairly divide these taxes based on what each province or district can actually afford. There will always be some level of misunderstanding or wrong information that can mislead even the most honest council. The amount each parish should pay of the total tax for the whole election, and what each person in that parish should pay, also changes each year based on what people think is needed. These decisions are made by the election officers and the parish leaders, who are influenced by the intendant. 

Not only can ignorance and wrong information lead to mistakes, but personal feelings like friendship, grudges, or political bias can also affect these assessments. Because of this, anyone who has to pay this tax can never be sure of how much they will owe before they are assessed, and they might not even know for sure afterward. If someone is taxed when they shouldn’t be, or if they are taxed too much, they still have to pay for now, but if they complain,
