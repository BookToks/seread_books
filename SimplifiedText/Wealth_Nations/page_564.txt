Every guy is a fighter and a hunter. When he goes to battle, either to protect his community or to get back at others who have hurt it, he takes care of himself just like he does at home. His community doesn’t spend any money to get him ready for war or to support him while he’s fighting.

In groups of shepherds, like the Tartars and Arabs, every guy is also a fighter. These groups usually don’t have a permanent home; they live in tents or covered wagons that are easy to move around. The whole tribe moves based on the seasons and other things happening. When their animals eat all the grass in one area, they go to another place. In dry seasons, they go to rivers, and in wet seasons, they move to higher ground.

When these groups go to war, the fighters won’t leave their animals with just the old people, women, and kids to protect them. The old people, women, and kids also won’t stay behind without protection and food. Since they’re used to moving around even when there’s no war, they can easily get ready to fight. Whether they march like an army or move like a group of shepherds, their way of life is pretty similar, even if their goals are different. They all go to war together, and everyone does their best. Among the Tartars, women have even been known to fight in battles.

If they win, they get everything from the enemy tribe as a reward. But if they lose, they lose everything, including their animals and their women and children, who become prizes for the winners. Most of the survivors have to give in to the conquerors just to survive, while others usually scatter in the wilderness.

The everyday life of a Tartar or Arab gets them ready for war. Running, wrestling, playing with sticks, throwing spears, and shooting bows are all fun activities for those who live outside, and they all prepare them for fighting. When a Tartar or Arab goes to war, he feeds himself with his own animals, just like he does in peacetime. His chief doesn’t spend any money to get him ready for battle, and the chance to steal from the enemy is the only reward he expects or needs. 

A group of hunters usually doesn’t have more than two or three hundred people.
