Adam Smith talks about how insurance can work well through joint-stock companies, which are groups of people who invest together. These companies don’t need special rights to operate. For example, the London Assurance and Royal Exchange Assurance companies don’t have any special privileges.

Once a canal or waterway is built, managing it becomes really easy and can follow strict rules. Building it can also be done by hiring workers for a set price per mile or per lock. This is true for things like canals, aqueducts, or big pipes that bring water to cities. Because of this, joint-stock companies can manage these projects successfully without needing special rights.

However, just starting a joint-stock company because it might do well isn’t a good enough reason. To make it reasonable, two things need to be true. First, it should clearly benefit the public more than most regular businesses. Second, it should need more money than a small group of people can raise. If only a moderate amount of money is needed, then private investors could easily handle it. The examples mentioned earlier meet both of these conditions.

The banking industry is really important when managed wisely, as explained in another part of this work. A public bank that helps the government and can lend a lot of money needs more funds than a small group can gather.

Insurance is also vital because it protects people’s money. By spreading out the risk of loss among many people, it makes the impact lighter for everyone. To provide this protection, insurance companies need a lot of money. Before the two insurance companies in London were set up, a list was shown to the attorney-general.
