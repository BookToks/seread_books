The Wealth of Nations

Sometimes, businesses make a lot of money, and other times they don’t make much at all. Usually, their profits don’t match up with other nearby businesses. When a new business starts doing well, it often makes a lot of money at first. But as more people join the market, the profits go down to be more like other businesses.

Next, the ups and downs of different jobs and investments can only happen when things are normal for those jobs. The need for different kinds of work can change a lot. When there’s a high demand for workers, like during harvest time, pay goes up. In times of war, when many sailors are taken for military service, the demand for sailors on merchant ships goes up, and so does their pay. On the other hand, if a factory is struggling, workers might accept lower pay instead of leaving their jobs.

The profits from investments change with the prices of the products being sold. If the price of something goes up, the profits from selling it also go up. But if the price goes down, profits drop too. Prices can change a lot, but some products change more than others. The amount of work put into making things each year is usually based on how much people want to buy, so the amount made is close to what people consume. 

In some industries, the same amount of work will produce about the same amount of products every year. For example, the same number of workers will make nearly the same amount of cloth each year. So, changes in the price of these products usually happen because of sudden changes in demand. For instance, if there’s a public mourning, the price of black cloth goes up. However, for most types of plain cloth, the demand and price stay pretty steady. But in other jobs, the same amount of work doesn’t always produce the same results.
