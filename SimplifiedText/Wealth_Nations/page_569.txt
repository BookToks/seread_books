The Wealth of Nations

A person wouldn’t usually choose to spend a lot of time on something that doesn't benefit them. It's really up to the government to make it worthwhile for someone to dedicate most of their time to a specific job. But governments don’t always know how to do this, even when they really need to.

A shepherd has a lot of free time, while a farmer has some, but a factory worker has none. The shepherd can spend time training for battles without losing anything. The farmer can spend a little time on it, but the factory worker can't afford to waste even an hour. Their focus on making money means they ignore military training. As farming and manufacturing improve, farmers end up with less free time too, just like factory workers. This means that people in both the countryside and cities stop caring about military training, and the whole population becomes less prepared for war. 

At the same time, the wealth that comes from better farming and manufacturing attracts attacks from neighboring countries. A hardworking and wealthy nation is often the most likely to be attacked. If the government doesn’t take action to protect its people, they won’t be able to defend themselves.

In this situation, there are two main ways the government can help protect the public.

First, it can create strict rules to force people to practice military training, even if they don’t want to. This means that all young citizens or a certain number of them would have to train as soldiers while also doing their regular jobs.

Second, the government can keep a certain number of citizens constantly training as soldiers, making being a soldier a full-time job separate from other jobs.

If the government goes with the first option, the military is called a militia. If it chooses the second option, it’s called a standing army. In a standing army, soldiers spend most of their time training for battles, and the government pays them to do this. For a militia, military training is just something they do occasionally while focusing on their other jobs.
