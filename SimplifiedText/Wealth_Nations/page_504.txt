So, some people have said no to being taxed by the British Parliament. Instead, like other strong and ambitious people, they’ve chosen to fight for their own importance.

Back when the Roman Republic was falling apart, the allies of Rome, who helped defend and expand the empire, wanted to be treated like real Roman citizens. When they were denied this, a big war started. During that war, Rome slowly gave those rights to many of them, one by one, as they broke away from the main group.

Now, the British Parliament wants to tax the American colonies, but the colonies don’t want to be taxed by a Parliament where they have no say. If Britain allowed each colony to have representatives based on how much they contributed to the empire’s taxes, and gave them the same trade freedoms as other British citizens, it could change things. This would give the leaders in each colony something to aim for, instead of just fighting over small local issues. They might then think they could win big in the larger game of British politics.

If Britain doesn’t find a way to keep the leaders in America feeling important and satisfied, it’s unlikely they will willingly accept British rule. We should remember that any violence used to force them into submission would hurt people we consider fellow citizens. It’s naive to think that the colonies can be easily conquered just by using force. The leaders of their continental congress feel a sense of importance that even some of the top leaders in Europe might not feel. They’ve gone from being shopkeepers and lawyers to becoming lawmakers, trying to create a new government for a large empire that they believe could become one of the most powerful in the world.
