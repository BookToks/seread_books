The Wealth of Nations

In England, different courts tried to get as many cases as possible. Each court wanted to handle more business, so they were open to taking on cases that weren't really meant for them. 

For example, the king’s bench was supposed to deal with criminal cases, but it also took civil cases. The person suing would claim that the other person did something wrong. The court of exchequer was meant to collect money for the king and handle debts owed to him, but it also took on other debts. The person suing would say they couldn’t pay the king because the other person hadn’t paid them. 

Because of this, it often depended on the people involved which court they wanted to use. Each court tried hard to be faster and fairer to attract more cases. The way the courts work today in England was shaped a lot by the competition between judges, who wanted to give the best solutions for unfair situations. 

At first, courts only gave money for broken contracts. Then, the court of chancery started to make sure agreements were actually followed. If someone didn’t pay money they owed, the court could order them to pay, which was like making them stick to the agreement. This worked for money cases, but not for others. 

For instance, if a tenant was kicked out of their home unfairly, the money they got for damages wasn’t the same as actually having their home back. So, these cases went to the court of chancery, which hurt the other courts. To get these cases back, the courts of law created a fake legal process called ejectment, which was a strong way to deal with unfair eviction from land. 

Also, if each court charged a fee for legal actions, it could help pay for judges and staff without putting extra pressure on the society's overall budget. However, judges might be tempted to create more unnecessary legal actions to make more money from these fees.
