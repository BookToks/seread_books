Adam Smith talks about how gold and silver are found and valued. Gold is usually found in its natural state, and even when it’s mixed with other stuff like sand, it can be easily separated using a little mercury. Because of this, it’s likely that the king gets less tax from gold than from silver, and rent costs less for gold too.

The lowest price for gold and silver is set by the same rules that apply to other goods. This means the costs of getting them from the mine to the market, like food, clothes, and housing, affect their price. The price has to be enough to cover these costs and make some profit. However, the highest price for gold and silver depends mainly on how rare they are. If gold becomes really rare, even a tiny piece can be worth more than a diamond.

People want gold and silver for two main reasons: they are useful and they look good. Besides iron, these metals are super useful because they don’t rust easily and are easy to keep clean. For example, a silver pot is cleaner than one made of lead or copper, and a gold pot would be even better. But the main reason people love them is their beauty, which makes them perfect for jewelry and decorations. No paint can match the shine of gold. Rich people enjoy showing off their wealth, and having rare and beautiful things like gold makes them feel even richer. They think that the value of something useful or pretty goes up if it’s hard to find or takes a lot of effort to get.
