Adam Smith talks about how people decide what to do with their money. If someone has money and wants to make some profit without working hard, they think about whether to buy land or lend their money out for interest. 

Buying land is usually seen as safer, so people might be okay with making less money from it compared to lending. The benefits of owning land often make up for the lower earnings, but only to a certain point. If the money made from renting land is much less than what they could earn from lending, no one would want to buy land, which would cause its price to drop. On the other hand, if owning land is way better, everyone would want it, and the price would go up. 

For example, when interest rates were at ten percent, land was sold for about ten to twelve years' worth of rent. But as interest rates went down to six, five, and four percent, land prices went up to twenty, twenty-five, and thirty years' worth of rent. In France, interest rates are higher than in England, and land prices are lower. In England, land usually sells for thirty years' worth of rent, while in France, it's around twenty years.

Now, when we talk about how money is used, all money is meant to help create jobs, but the amount of work it can create changes a lot depending on how it's used. 

Money can be used in four main ways: First, to get raw materials that people need every year. Second, to turn those raw materials into products that can be used right away. Third, to move those raw or finished products from where they are made to where they are needed. Lastly, to break down larger amounts of products into smaller pieces that people want. 

The first way is how farmers or people who work in mines and fisheries use their money. The second way is how factory owners use their money. The third way is how big sellers use their money, and the fourth way is how retailers use their money.
