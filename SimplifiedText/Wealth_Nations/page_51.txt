The market price of a product is decided by how much of it is available and how many people want to buy it at a fair price. The people who are ready to pay that fair price are called effectual demanders, and their interest is called effectual demand. This is different from just wanting something. For example, a really poor person might want a fancy car, but they can't actually buy it, so their demand doesn't count.

When there isn't enough of a product for everyone who wants it, those who can pay the full price might not get what they want. Because of this, some people will be willing to pay more to get it. This creates competition, and the market price will go up above the fair price. How much it goes up depends on how much less of the product there is and how rich the buyers are. If everyone has the same amount of money, the importance of getting the product will also affect how much they compete for it. This is why prices for basic needs can skyrocket during a crisis or a shortage.

On the other hand, if thereâ€™s too much of a product and not enough people wanting to buy it at the fair price, some will have to sell to those who can pay less. This will lower the overall price. The market price will drop below the fair price depending on how much extra product there is and how eager sellers are to get rid of it. For things that spoil quickly, like fruit, there will be more competition to sell them than for things that last longer, like metal.

When the amount of a product available is just right to meet the demand, the market price will be close to the fair price. This means everything can be sold at that price, and no one will pay more.
