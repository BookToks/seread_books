Adam Smith

The rules that have been set up are making it really hard for France and England to trade fairly. Because of this, smugglers are now the main people bringing British stuff into France and French stuff into Great Britain.

In the last chapter, I talked about how private interests and the desire for control started these issues. Now, I’m going to look at how national pride and dislike for each other make things even worse. These reasons are even more unreasonable, especially when we think about trade.

First, even if we knew that free trade between France and England would help France more, it doesn’t mean that England would lose out. If French wines are better and cheaper than Portuguese wines, or if French linens are nicer than German linens, it would actually be smarter for Great Britain to buy those from France instead of Portugal or Germany. Even if Britain buys more from France, the overall amount they import could go down if the French goods are cheaper.

Second, some of the French goods could be sold to other countries for a profit, which might bring back money equal to what Britain spent on those goods. People often say that the East India trade works this way, and the same could be true for French goods. Even though most East India products are bought with gold and silver, selling some of them to other countries could bring back more money than what was originally spent. Right now, a big part of Dutch trade is moving French goods to other European countries. Some French wine that people drink in Great Britain even comes in secretly from Holland and Zealand. If there was free trade between France and England, or if they could import French goods by just paying the same taxes as other countries and get those taxes back when they export, England could benefit from a trade that is really good for Holland.

Lastly, there’s no clear way to figure out which side has the better trade balance.
