Adam Smith talks about how money can be wasted in a year without any chance of getting it back. When people lend money to the government, they usually get something back, like an annuity, which is a regular payment that is worth more than what they gave. This payment helps them keep their business going, or even grow it. They can either borrow more money based on this payment or sell it to get cash to use.

However, this new money they get was already in the country and was being used to support jobs. So, when they get this money, it’s new for them but not for the country. It just means that money is being moved from one job to another. If they hadn’t lent money to the government, there would have been more money available for jobs in the country.

When the government collects taxes to pay for its expenses, it takes money from people that could have been used for productive jobs and uses it for other things that don’t create value. Some of the tax money could have been saved and used for jobs that produce goods, but most of it would likely have been spent on things that don’t help the economy. While this way of paying for government expenses can slow down the growth of new money, it doesn’t destroy any money that already exists.

When the government pays for things by borrowing money, it can lead to the loss of some existing money that was being used for productive jobs. This means some of the money that could have helped create jobs is instead used for things that don’t help the economy. However, since taxes are lower this way, people have more money left over, which means they can save and invest more. If borrowing destroys more existing money, it can hurt the economy even more.
