Adam Smith

At the same time and place, the real price and the money price of all goods are exactly related. The more or less money you get for something in the London market, for example, affects how much work you can get for that money at that time and place. So, money is a clear way to measure the real value of all goods, but only at that specific time and place.

Even though prices can be different in faraway places, a merchant who moves goods from one place to another only cares about the money price. They look at how much silver they pay to buy the goods and how much they can sell them for. For example, half an ounce of silver in Canton, China, might buy more work and necessities than an ounce of silver in London. So, something that costs half an ounce in Canton might actually be more valuable to someone there than something that costs an ounce in London is to someone in London. 

If a merchant from London can buy something in Canton for half an ounce and sell it in London for an ounce, they make a huge profit, just like if an ounce of silver was worth the same in both places. It doesn’t matter to them that half an ounce in Canton could buy more work and necessities than an ounce can in London. An ounce in London will always buy them double what half an ounce could in Canton, and that’s exactly what they want.

Since the money price of goods is what really matters for making smart buying and selling decisions, it makes sense that people pay more attention to it than the real price. However, it can sometimes be helpful to compare the real value of a specific good at different times and places or how much power it gives over other people's work. In this case, we should look at how much work those different amounts of silver could buy, rather than just the silver prices. But it’s really hard to know the current prices of work in different times and places accurately. The prices of corn, though...
