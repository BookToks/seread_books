The Wealth of Nations

Every hundred pounds of stock was taxed at twenty-four shillings, which is a part of six pounds. Now that the legal interest rate is down to five percent, every hundred pounds of stock is taxed at just twenty shillings. The money collected from what’s called the land tax is split between the countryside and the main towns. Most of it is paid by the countryside, and in the towns, most of the tax is based on houses. 

The tax on businesses or trade in towns is much lower than what those businesses are really worth. So, any unfairness in how the tax was originally set up doesn’t cause much trouble. Each area still pays taxes on its land, houses, and businesses based on the original setup. Because the country is doing well and the value of everything has gone up, these unfairnesses matter even less now. The tax rate for each area stays the same, which means that the uncertainty about how much tax a person has to pay on their business has become less important. 

In England, a lot of land isn’t taxed at even half its real value, and most businesses are probably taxed at less than one-fiftieth of their actual worth. In some towns, like Westminster, the entire land tax is based on houses, while businesses are not taxed. But it’s different in London.

In every country, they try to avoid digging too deep into people’s personal situations. In Hamburg, everyone has to pay the government a quarter percent of what they own. Since most people in Hamburg have their wealth in businesses, this tax is basically a tax on businesses. Each person figures out their own tax and, in front of a judge, pays a certain amount of money that they say is a quarter percent of their total wealth, without saying how much that is or being checked on it. People usually pay this tax honestly. 

In a small place where people trust their leaders, understand that the tax is needed for the government, and believe it will be used properly, they might pay it willingly. This isn’t just something that happens in Hamburg. 

In the canton of Underwald in Switzerland, storms and floods often cause extra costs. When this happens, the people come together to discuss what to do.
