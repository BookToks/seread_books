The Wealth of Nations

If there were no taxes on imported goods, it wouldn’t stop them from coming in completely. The shipping trade shouldn’t be limited; it should be free like other businesses. This trade is important for money that can’t be used in farming or making things in the country, or in selling things at home or abroad.

The customs revenue actually benefits from these tax refunds because part of the tax is kept. If all the taxes were kept, foreign goods would rarely be sold or brought in because there wouldn’t be a market for them. So, the taxes that are partially refunded would never have been paid in the first place.

These points seem to explain why tax refunds are reasonable. They would still make sense even if all taxes on local products or foreign goods were refunded when exported. The excise tax would lose a bit of money, and customs would lose a lot more. But the natural balance of industry and the way work is divided would be restored better with this rule.

However, these refunds should only apply to goods sent to completely independent foreign countries, not to places where our merchants and manufacturers have a monopoly. For example, a tax refund on European goods sent to our American colonies might not lead to more goods being sent than if the full taxes were kept. Because of the monopoly our merchants have there, the same amount might be shipped even if all the taxes were kept.

So, these refunds could often just be a loss for the excise and customs revenue without changing the trade situation or making it bigger. It will be discussed later how much these refunds can encourage our colonies’ industries or if it’s fair for them to not pay taxes like everyone else.

It’s important to note that refunds are only useful when the goods are actually sent to a foreign country and not secretly brought back into our own. It’s well known that some refunds, especially on tobacco, have been misused and led to fraud, which harms both the revenue and honest traders.
