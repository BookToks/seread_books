Adam Smith talks about how it's important to keep the way work is divided in society, rather than just getting rid of things. 

He also mentions the rules about bringing foreign goods into Great Britain. When goods are brought in, there’s a tax, but if those goods are sent back out, merchants can get some of that tax money back. English merchants can get back half the tax if they export within a year, while foreign merchants have nine months to do the same. Some items like wines and silks have different rules that are better for them. 

At that time, these taxes were the only ones on foreign goods. Later, the time to claim back taxes was extended to three years. Most taxes that were added after the original ones can be fully refunded when goods are exported, but there are many exceptions, making the rules more complicated than before.

For some foreign goods, if it looks like we’ll import way more than we need, all the taxes can be refunded. Before we lost our North American colonies, we were the only ones who could sell tobacco from Maryland and Virginia. We brought in a lot of it, but only a small amount was used at home. To help with selling the extra, all the taxes were refunded if it was exported within three years.

We still have almost complete control over sugar from the West Indies. If sugar is exported within a year, all the import taxes are refunded. If it’s exported within three years, they get back all but half of the original tax. Even though we bring in more sugar than we need, it’s not as much as what we used to bring in with tobacco.

Some goods that our own manufacturers worry about can’t be brought in for home use. However, they can still be imported if certain taxes are paid.
