The Wealth of Nations

In the past, kings didn't really get involved in money matters. This might explain why interest rates were so high back then. When laws completely ban interest, it doesn’t stop people from borrowing money. Many need loans, and lenders won’t give money without charging interest that makes sense based on what they can earn and the risks of breaking the law. Montesquieu suggested that the high interest rates in Muslim countries aren’t just because they’re poor, but also because it’s hard to get the money back.

The lowest profit someone can make has to be more than what covers occasional losses that come with using money. This extra amount is what we call clear profit. Gross profit often includes this extra and also what’s saved for unexpected losses. The interest a borrower can pay depends on their clear profit. Similarly, the lowest interest rate must be higher than what covers the occasional losses from lending money. If it weren’t, people would only lend out of kindness.

In a wealthy country where every business has enough money, the usual profit would be very low. This means that only the richest people could live off the interest from their money. Those with less money would have to manage their own investments. Almost everyone would need to be involved in business or some kind of trade. In Holland, for example, it’s common for everyone to be a businessman. It’s expected, and people follow what’s normal. Just like it’s silly not to dress well, it’s also a bit odd not to work like everyone else. A person who doesn’t work feels out of place among those who do.

The highest profit rates can be so high that they take all the money that should go to land rent, leaving just enough to pay workers the lowest wages possible to prepare and sell goods.
