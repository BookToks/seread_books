The Wealth of Nations

People usually spend money based on how easy they think it is to get more money, not just on how much they really have. 

When one group of people gets special rights to sell something, it can actually hurt everyone else in the country. 

Starting a big empire just to create a bunch of customers might sound like a plan only a shopkeeper would come up with. But it’s really not a good idea for shopkeepers themselves; it’s better for a country where shopkeepers have a lot of power. Only those kinds of leaders would think it’s smart to use their citizens’ money and lives to build and keep such an empire. 

If you ask a shopkeeper to buy a nice piece of land for you, promising to always buy your clothes from them—even if they’re more expensive—they probably won’t be too excited about it. But if someone else buys that land for you, the shopkeeper would be really thankful if you promised to buy all your clothes from their store. 

England bought a large piece of land in another country for some of its people who were unhappy at home. The cost was really low, much less than what land usually costs today. It was just enough to cover the expenses of exploring and claiming the land. The land was good and big, and the people who worked it were able to sell their crops wherever they wanted. In just about thirty to forty years (from 1620 to 1660), they became so successful that shopkeepers and other sellers in England wanted to make sure they got all their business. 

So, without saying they had paid anything for the land or its improvements, these traders asked the government to make sure the people in America had to buy everything they needed from their stores and could only sell their crops to them. They didn’t want to buy everything, though, because some of the crops might compete with what they sold in England. So, they were okay with letting the colonists sell those crops wherever they could, even if it was far away.
