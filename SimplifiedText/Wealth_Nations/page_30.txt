CHAPTER V

THE REAL AND NOMINAL PRICE OF COMMODITIES, OR THEIR PRICE IN LABOUR AND MONEY

Every person is considered rich or poor based on how much they can enjoy the basic needs, comforts, and fun things in life. But once people start working together and dividing tasks, most of what someone has can't just come from their own work. Instead, they get most of it from what other people do. So, whether someone is rich or poor depends on how much work they can get from others or how much they can pay for it.

The value of something, for someone who owns it and wants to trade it for something else, is based on how much work they can buy with it. So, work is the real measure of how much everything is worth when trading.

The real price of anything is the effort it takes to get it. For someone who has something and wants to sell or trade it, its worth is based on how much effort it can save them and how much effort it makes others do. What we buy with money or goods is still paid for with work, just like what we get from our own hard work. Money or goods save us from that effort because they represent a certain amount of work that we can trade for something else of equal value. Originally, everything was bought with work, not gold or silver. The value of what someone has is equal to how much work they can buy with it.

Wealth, as Mr. Hobbes says, is power. However, just because someone gets a lot of money doesn't mean they automatically gain political power or control. Their wealth might help them gain power, but just having money doesnâ€™t give them any power directly. The real power that comes from having money is the ability to buy control over the work or products available in the market. The amount of money someone has determines how much power they have in this way.
