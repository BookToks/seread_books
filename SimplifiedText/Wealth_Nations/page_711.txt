The Wealth of Nations

When taxes are put on land and goods, it usually leads to lower land rents and higher prices for manufactured items. This is different from what would happen if the tax was split between land rent and things people buy.

When there are direct taxes on workers' wages, it doesn't always mean their pay goes up. This is because these taxes often cause a drop in the demand for workers. As a result, there are fewer jobs, less work for poor people, and less overall production from the land and labor in the country. Because of these taxes, the cost of labor usually ends up being higher than it would be if demand stayed the same. This extra cost is ultimately paid by landlords and consumers.

A tax on workers' wages doesn’t increase the price of what the land produces by the same amount as the tax. This is similar to how a tax on a farmer's profits doesn’t raise prices in the same way.

Even though these taxes are unreasonable and harmful, they still exist in many countries. In France, part of the tax called the taille is applied to workers and laborers in rural areas. Their wages are calculated based on the average pay in their area, and to avoid being taxed too much, their yearly earnings are estimated as if they only worked 200 days a year. Each person's tax changes yearly based on different factors, which the tax collector decides.

In Bohemia, since financial changes started in 1748, there’s a heavy tax on workers. They are split into four groups. The top group pays a tax of a hundred florins a year, which is about £9:7:6. The second group pays seventy florins, the third pays fifty, and the fourth group, which includes village workers and the lowest town workers, pays twenty-five florins.

The pay for skilled artists and professionals is connected to what less skilled workers earn. So, if there’s a tax on their pay, it will likely make their earnings go up more than the tax amount. If their pay didn’t increase, then the skilled arts and professions would suffer.
