People were worried about what would happen if the government suddenly stopped a lot of our main manufacturers from working. They thought it would cause a lot of chaos and confusion. 

To avoid this, it seems like a slow and careful change in the laws that give Great Britain control over trade with the colonies is the best solution. This would help Great Britain gradually shift some of its resources away from this big job and into other areas, even if those areas make less money. By slowly reducing one part of the economy and increasing others, everything could eventually get back to a healthy balance that real freedom can support. 

If they opened up trade with the colonies to everyone all at once, it could cause some temporary problems and even long-term losses for many people currently involved in that trade. For example, losing the jobs of the ships that bring in a lot of tobacco would be felt strongly. These are the unfortunate results of strict trade rules. They not only create serious issues for the country but also make it hard to fix those problems without causing even bigger ones. 

So, how to gradually open up the colony trade, which rules to remove first, and how to bring back a fair system of freedom and justice is something we have to leave for future leaders to figure out.

Five unexpected events have helped Great Britain not feel the impact of being cut off from a key part of the colony trade for over a year, starting from December 1, 1774. First, the colonies prepared for their agreement to stop importing goods, which meant they took all the products they needed from Great Britain. Second, this year, there was a huge demand from the Spanish fleet, which took a lot of goods from Germany and the north, especially linen, that would usually compete with British products. Third, the peace between Russia and Turkey created a big demand for goods.
