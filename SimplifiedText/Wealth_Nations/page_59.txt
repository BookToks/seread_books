The Wealth of Nations

There are two different groups involved in work: the people who own businesses and the workers. 

Usually, there are way more workers than business owners in Europe. So, when we talk about how much workers get paid, it’s based on the agreement between the workers and the owners. They don’t want the same things. Workers want to earn as much as possible, while owners want to pay as little as they can. Workers might team up to try to get higher wages, and owners might work together to lower them.

It’s pretty clear who usually wins in these arguments. Since there are fewer owners, they can easily join forces. The law also helps them out because it allows owners to team up, but it often stops workers from doing the same. There are no laws against owners teaming up to pay less, but there are many laws against workers teaming up to ask for more. In these situations, owners can last longer without needing to pay workers. A landlord or business owner can survive for a while without any workers because they have savings. But most workers can’t go long without a job—many can’t last a week, and hardly any can last a month.

People often talk about workers teaming up, but we don’t hear much about owners doing the same. Some might think owners don’t team up, but that’s not true. Owners are always kind of secretly working together to keep wages low. If an owner tries to raise wages, they might get looked down upon by other owners. We don’t notice this teamwork because it’s just how things usually are. Sometimes, owners will secretly come together to lower wages even more, and they keep it quiet until they’re ready to act. When workers give in without fighting back, it’s not something people usually hear about. But these secret plans are often met with resistance from workers who band together to fight back.
