The Wealth of Nations

A standing army can actually help protect freedom because it has a lot of power itself. It can make things safer for the leader, which means they don’t have to worry as much about people getting upset over little things. In some countries, leaders are always nervous about what the people might do, and even a small protest can lead to big changes. This makes them feel like they have to control everything and punish anyone who complains.

But if a leader feels strong support from both the important people in the country and a well-organized army, they don’t have to worry much about complaints, even if they are silly or unreasonable. They can choose to ignore them or forgive them, which makes it easier for them to rule. In places where the army is strong, leaders can handle a bit of freedom that might seem out of control because they don’t need to be overly strict to keep the peace.

As society gets more advanced, the leader’s job of protecting people from other groups becomes more expensive. At first, the army didn’t cost the leader anything during peace or war, but over time, they have to pay for it, especially during war and even during peace. 

The way wars are fought has changed a lot because of guns, which makes it more expensive to train and keep soldiers ready. Guns and cannons cost more than old weapons like spears and bows. When soldiers practice with modern guns, they waste a lot of expensive ammunition. In the past, arrows and spears could be picked up and reused easily, and they didn’t cost much. Modern weapons are not only more expensive but also heavier and harder to transport, which adds to the costs of getting ready for battle. Overall, modern artillery is much better than what was used in ancient times, making it tougher and more costly to manage.
