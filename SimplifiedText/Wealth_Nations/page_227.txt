The Wealth of Nations

First, let's talk about the stuff that’s already made but is still with the seller or manufacturer and hasn’t been sold to the right customers yet. This includes things you see ready to buy in stores like tools from a blacksmith, furniture from a cabinet-maker, jewelry from a goldsmith, and dishes from a china shop. The circulating capital is all the supplies, materials, and finished products that sellers have, plus the money needed to sell and distribute these items to the people who will actually use them.

Out of the four parts of capital, three—supplies, materials, and finished products—are regularly taken out and put into fixed capital or saved for immediate use. Fixed capital needs circulating capital to keep going. All useful machines and tools come from circulating capital, which provides the materials to make them and pays the workers who build them. These machines also need circulating capital to stay in good shape.

No fixed capital can make money without circulating capital. Even the best machines won’t work without the materials they need and the workers to run them. Land, no matter how improved, won’t generate income without circulating capital to support the workers who farm it and gather its produce.

The main goal of both fixed and circulating capitals is to keep and grow the stock that’s available for immediate use. This stock is what feeds, clothes, and houses people. Whether people are rich or poor depends on how much of this stock is available from the two types of capital.

Since a lot of circulating capital is constantly being moved to the other two parts of society’s overall stock, it needs regular supplies to keep existing. These supplies mainly come from three places: land, mines, and fisheries. They provide a steady flow of food and materials, some of which are turned into finished products, helping to replace the supplies taken from circulating capital. Mines also provide what’s needed to maintain and grow the money part of circulating capital.
