Adam Smith

There might be a way to manage things that would help reduce confusion and costs. 

For example, landlords and tenants could be required to officially record their lease in a public place. There could be penalties for hiding or lying about any details, and if someone reported the other for doing this, they could get part of the penalty as a reward. This would stop them from teaming up to cheat the government. With this record, everyone would know the lease details.

Some landlords choose to charge a one-time fee instead of raising the rent when the lease is renewed. This often hurts the landlord because they get a quick payment but lose out on future money. It can also hurt the tenant and the community. The fee can take away a lot of the tenant's money, making it harder for them to pay rent, even if it’s lower. When tenants can’t farm effectively, it reduces the overall income for everyone. If the tax on these fees was higher than on regular rent, it could discourage this practice, helping landlords, tenants, the government, and the community.

Some leases require tenants to farm in a specific way or grow certain crops for the entire lease period. This usually comes from the landlord thinking they know better, which isn’t always true. This should be seen as an extra cost, like a service fee, rather than just money. To discourage this silly practice, this type of fee could be taxed more than regular rent.

Some landlords want rent paid in goods like food, animals, or services instead of money. These kinds of payments usually hurt the tenant more than they help the landlord. They often take more money from the tenant than what they give to the landlord. In places where this happens, tenants tend to be poorer. If these goods were valued higher and taxed more than regular money rent, it could help improve the situation.
