The Wealth of Nations

Labor doesn’t change a lot from year to year based on how much corn costs. Instead, it seems to adjust to the average price of corn, which is something people need to live. The average price of corn is influenced by the value of silver, how rich or poor the silver mines are, and how much work is needed to get silver from the mines to the market.

The value of silver can change a lot over many years, but it usually stays pretty stable from year to year. Sometimes, it can even stay the same for fifty or a hundred years. Because of this, the average price of corn and the money people earn from labor can also stay similar for a long time, as long as everything else in society stays mostly the same. However, the price of corn can jump up a lot from one year to the next, sometimes even doubling. When corn is really expensive, it means that the value of rent for corn is also higher, and it can buy more labor or other goods. But during these price changes, the money people earn from labor and the prices of most things usually stay the same.

So, labor is the best way to measure value. It’s the only thing we can use to compare how much different goods are worth, no matter when or where. We can’t really figure out the true value of things based on how much silver people paid for them over the years. And we can’t do it based on corn prices either. But we can use labor to measure value accurately, both over the years and across centuries. Over long periods, corn is a better measure than silver because it tends to reflect the amount of labor needed more closely. But for short periods, silver is a better measure because it also reflects labor needs closely.

Even though it can be helpful to know the difference between real and nominal prices when setting long-term rents or leases, it doesn’t really matter when people are just buying and selling things in everyday life.
