The Wealth of Nations

When people in the same job get together, it shouldn’t be made easier or necessary for them to do so. A rule that makes everyone in the same trade in a town register their names and addresses helps them meet each other. It connects people who might not know each other and shows everyone where to find others in their trade.

If people in the same trade can decide to tax themselves to help their poor, sick, widows, and orphans, it makes these gatherings necessary. When a group is formed, it not only makes these meetings necessary but also means that what most people decide will apply to everyone. In a free trade, a strong group can only be formed if everyone agrees, and it won’t last unless everyone stays on the same page. A majority in a corporation can create rules with penalties that limit competition better and longer than any voluntary group.

The idea that corporations are needed to run trade better isn’t true. The real control over a worker comes from their customers. It’s the fear of losing their job that keeps workers honest and makes them do their job well. A closed corporation weakens this control. If a specific group of workers must be hired, it doesn’t matter if they do a good or bad job. That’s why in many big towns with corporations, you can’t find decent workers, even in important jobs. If you want good work done, you have to go to the suburbs, where workers don’t have special privileges and rely on their reputation, and then you have to sneak it into the town.

This is how Europe’s policies, by limiting competition in some jobs, create big differences in the benefits and drawbacks of various jobs and investments. On the other hand, Europe’s policies also increase competition in some jobs more than it naturally would be, creating another kind of inequality in the advantages and disadvantages of different jobs and investments.

It’s seen as really important to have enough young people trained for certain professions, so sometimes the public or private groups step in to help.
