The Wealth of Nations

The company should pay off its debts and lower them to £1,500,000. Only then can they share eight percent of their profits. After that, they should split what’s left of their money into four parts. Three parts would go to the government for public use, and the last part would be saved either to pay off more debts or to handle any unexpected expenses the company might have. 

But if the company was bad at managing money when all their profits were theirs, they probably wouldn’t do better when they had to share most of it with others. The remaining part, even though it would be used for the company’s benefit, would still be watched over by other people. 

The company might prefer that their own workers waste or steal any extra money left after paying the eight percent dividend, rather than letting it go to people who might not agree with them. The interests of these workers could influence the company’s decisions, sometimes leading them to support those who broke the rules. For many owners, keeping their own authority might matter less than keeping the support of those who ignored it.

The rules set in 1773 didn’t fix the company’s problems in India. Even though they once collected over £3,000,000 and expanded their control over rich areas, they wasted it all. They were not ready to deal with attacks from Hyder Ali, and because of these issues, the company was in worse trouble than ever by 1784. To avoid going bankrupt, they had to ask the government for help again. 

Different plans were suggested in parliament to improve how the company was run, and they all agreed that the company was not fit to manage its territories. Even the company seemed to realize this and was willing to give up some control.
