Adam Smith talks about how schools and colleges get their money. They usually don’t take much from the general funds. Instead, they get money from local sources, like land rents or interest from money set aside for education. This money can come from the government or from private donors.

He asks if these funds really help schools achieve their goals. Do they motivate teachers to work harder and get better at their jobs? Do they help guide education toward things that are more useful for both students and society? It shouldn’t be too hard to answer these questions.

In any job, how hard people work often depends on how much they need to. Those who rely on their job for their income tend to work the hardest. To earn money, they have to complete a certain amount of work each year. When there’s competition, everyone tries to do their job well to keep their position. 

Sometimes, big goals can inspire a few really ambitious people to work hard. But you don’t need huge goals to get people to put in a lot of effort. Competition itself can push even those in less glamorous jobs to strive for excellence. On the other hand, just having big goals without the need to work hard usually doesn’t lead to much effort. For example, in England, becoming a successful lawyer can lead to great achievements, but not many people born into wealth have become top lawyers.

The funding for schools and colleges has made it less necessary for teachers to work hard. Their income, especially from salaries, comes from money that doesn’t depend on how well they do in their jobs. In some universities, the salary is just a small part of what teachers earn.
