Adam Smith talks about how landowners can make money from their land. When cows roam freely in the woods, they don’t hurt the old trees but stop new ones from growing. Over time, this can ruin the whole forest. When wood becomes scarce, its price goes up. 

Landowners sometimes find that it’s better to grow trees for timber than to use their land for crops or grazing animals. In some places in Great Britain, growing trees can make as much money as farming. However, landowners usually can’t make more money from trees than they would from crops or grazing, especially in well-farmed areas. 

On the coast, if coal is easy to get, it might be cheaper to import timber from other countries than to grow it locally. For example, in the new town of Edinburgh, there’s probably no local timber at all.

When it comes to fuel prices, if the cost of using coal is about the same as using wood, it means coal prices are as high as they can be in that area. This is true in some parts of England, like Oxfordshire, where people often mix coal and wood for their fires, showing that the price difference isn’t huge. 

In places where coal is mined, the prices are usually lower than this highest price. If they weren’t, it wouldn’t make sense to transport coal over long distances. Miners prefer to sell a lot of coal at a slightly higher price rather than a little at a really high price. The best coal mines set the price for all the other nearby mines. 

Both the mine owners and the workers want to sell their coal for less than their neighbors to attract more buyers. This forces their neighbors to lower their prices too, even if it hurts their profits. Some mines end up closing, and others can only operate if the owner works them without paying rent. The lowest price for coal, like other goods, is the one that just covers the costs.
