Adam Smith talked about how money works. The value of gold and silver wasn't set by any law but was decided by what people were willing to pay in the market. If someone owed money and wanted to pay with gold, the person they owed could either refuse it or agree on a value for the gold.

Right now, copper coins can only be used for making change with smaller silver coins. Because of this, there’s a real difference between what counts as standard money and what doesn’t.

Over time, as people got used to using different metals for coins, they figured out how to compare their values. In many places, it became easier to set a value by law. For example, a guinea coin of a certain weight and quality was declared to be worth twenty-one shillings. When this value was set, the difference between standard money and non-standard money didn’t seem as important.

But if the value of a guinea changed, like if it was lowered to twenty shillings or raised to twenty-two, it would matter again. Most payments would still be made with the same amount of silver, but the amount of gold needed would change. Silver would seem to hold its value better than gold. It would look like silver was used to measure gold's value, not the other way around. The value of gold would depend on how much silver it could be traded for, while silver's value wouldn’t depend on gold.

This difference comes from how people keep track of money, usually using silver more than gold. For example, if someone had a note for twenty-five or fifty guineas, they would still pay that amount after any changes, but the amount of silver needed would be different. After the change, gold would seem to hold its value better than silver. Gold would look like it measured silver’s value, while silver wouldn’t measure gold’s value.
