It seems that the changes happening in Scotland are too big to just be explained by one reason. But it's clear that trade and jobs in Scotland have grown a lot during this time, and the banks have played a big part in that growth.

Before the Union in 1707, the silver money in Scotland was worth £411,117: 10: 9. We don’t know how much gold money there was, but old records show that more gold was made each year than silver. Many people didn’t bring their silver to the Bank of Scotland because they were worried about getting it back, and some English coins were also not collected. So, the total value of gold and silver in Scotland before the Union was probably over a million pounds. This money was almost all the cash in the country. Even though the Bank of Scotland was important, it was just a small part of the total money in circulation. Nowadays, Scotland has at least two million in circulation, but less than half a million of that is in gold and silver. Even though the amount of gold and silver has gone down a lot, Scotland's real wealth and success seem to be fine. In fact, farming, manufacturing, and trade have all clearly improved.

Banks mainly make money by giving loans on bills of exchange, which means they lend money before the bills are due. They always take off the legal interest from whatever amount they lend until the bill is due. When the bill is paid, the bank gets back what it lent plus the interest as profit. Instead of giving out gold and silver, the banker gives the merchant his own promissory notes, which lets him lend out more money because those notes are usually accepted. This way, the banker can earn interest on a larger amount.

The trade in Scotland isn’t very big now, but it was even smaller when the first two banks started. If those banks had only focused on discounting bills, they wouldn’t have had much business at all.
