Adam Smith talks about how banks can help businesses by letting them borrow money instead of keeping a lot of cash on hand. This way, businesses don’t have to keep a lot of their money just sitting there for emergencies. Banks can really help all kinds of traders.

He also mentions that it’s not fair to stop people from accepting banknotes as payment if they want to, or to stop banks from giving out those notes if everyone around is okay with it. This goes against the idea of personal freedom, which laws should protect, not take away. However, if a few people's freedom could put everyone else at risk, then laws should step in to keep things safe. For example, building walls between houses to stop fires is similar to the rules about banking that he talks about.

Smith explains that paper money, like banknotes from trustworthy banks, is just as good as gold or silver because you can always trade it for those metals. Anything bought or sold with paper money should cost the same as if it were bought with gold or silver.

Some people think that having more paper money makes everything more expensive because it lowers the value of money overall. But since the amount of gold and silver taken out of circulation matches the amount of paper money added, it doesn’t really change the total money supply. For example, in Scotland, food prices were never lower than in 1759, even though there were more banknotes in circulation back then. The prices of food in Scotland compared to England are still the same now as they were before there were so many banks in Scotland. Also, grain prices in England are often just as low as in France, even though England has a lot of paper money and France has very little. When Mr. Hume wrote his Political Discourses in 1751 and 1752, right after more paper money was introduced in Scotland, food prices did go up noticeably.
