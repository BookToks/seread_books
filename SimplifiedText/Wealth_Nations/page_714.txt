The government in France sets a specific amount of money that each area has to pay. If a region thinks they are being charged too much, they can ask for a lower amount the next year, but they still have to pay the higher amount in the meantime. The person in charge, called the intendant, can charge a little extra to make sure they collect enough money, just in case some people can’t pay. Before 1765, the intendant decided how much extra to charge, but then the council took over that job.

When it comes to taxes, the rich and those with special privileges pay the least. Most of the tax burden falls on regular people who pay a tax based on their income. These taxes on regular people are direct taxes on their earnings and can be really tough for them.

Capitation taxes are cheap to collect, and if they are enforced strictly, they provide a steady income for the government. Because of this, in places where the needs of everyday people aren’t prioritized, these taxes are common. However, in big countries, these taxes usually make up a small part of the total money the government collects, and there are often better ways to collect money that are easier for people.

Since it’s hard to tax people based on their income directly, governments often tax things people buy instead. They think that how much people spend is usually related to how much money they make. They tax the things people buy, which can be either necessities or luxuries. Necessities are not just things needed to survive, but also things that are considered important for people to have in society, like a clean shirt.
