I couldn't find any real records about how much raw hides cost a long time ago. People usually paid wool as a tax to the king, which gives us some idea of its price. But raw hides were different. In 1425, there was a record of prices between a church leader and one of his helpers. They said five ox hides cost twelve shillings, five cow hides cost seven shillings and threepence, thirty-six two-year-old sheep skins cost nine shillings, and sixteen calf skins cost two shillings.

Back in 1425, twelve shillings was worth about the same as twenty-four shillings today. So, an ox hide was valued at around 4 shillings and 4/5ths of what we use now. This price was lower than today’s prices. With twelve shillings, you could buy about fourteen bushels of wheat, which would cost about 51 shillings today. So, an ox hide back then would buy as much corn as ten shillings and threepence would buy today. Its real value was about ten shillings and threepence now.

In those old days, cattle were often underfed during winter, so they weren’t very big. A good ox hide weighed about four stone, which is 16 pounds. Today, a hide like that would cost about ten shillings. Even though the price looks higher now, the actual value of what it can buy is a bit lower. The price of cow hides was similar to ox hides, but sheep skins were more expensive because they were likely sold with the wool. Calf skins, on the other hand, were cheaper. In places where cattle are cheap, calves that aren’t meant to grow up are often killed young to save milk costs. So, their skins aren’t worth much.

Right now, the price of raw hides is lower than it was a few years ago. This might be because the tax on seal skins was removed and they allowed raw hides to be imported from Ireland and other places without tax for a while.
