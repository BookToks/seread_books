When it comes to small jobs that only help a few people, there aren't many workers needed. Those workers can usually work together in one place, so it's easy to see what they're doing.

But for big jobs that help a lot of people, there are so many workers that they can't all fit in one place. We usually only see the workers from one part of the job at a time. Even though these big jobs are split into more parts than the small ones, it's not as easy to notice, so people pay less attention to it.

For example, let's look at pin-making, which is a small job but has a clear division of labor. If someone who isn't trained in this job tried to make pins, they would struggle to make even one pin in a day, and definitely not twenty. 

Now, in the way pin-making is done today, the whole process is a specific job, and it's divided into many smaller tasks. One person pulls the wire, another straightens it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, and a fifth grinds the top for the head. Making the head takes a few steps, and putting it on is a separate job. There’s even a job just for putting the pins into paper. Overall, making a pin is split into about eighteen different tasks, and in some factories, different people do each task, while in others, one person might do two or three tasks.

I’ve seen a small factory with only ten workers, and since they were poor and didn’t have the best machines, they still managed to make about twelve pounds of pins in a day when they worked hard. There are over four thousand pins in a pound, so those ten workers could make more than forty-eight thousand pins in a day. Each person, then, could be seen as making about four thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all...
