The success of any one teacher or group of teachers wouldn’t be very big. When there’s only one religious group allowed, or when a society is split into just a few big groups, the teachers can be really intense and cause problems. But if a society has hundreds or even thousands of small groups, none of them would be strong enough to cause trouble. 

The teachers of each small group would see that they have more opponents than supporters. This would force them to be more understanding and calm, which is often missing in the bigger groups. The beliefs of those big groups are usually backed by the government, so almost everyone in large countries respects them and sees them as leaders. 

In contrast, the teachers of smaller groups would have to respect each other. They might find it helpful to agree on certain things, which could lead to a more reasonable and clear religion that avoids nonsense and extreme beliefs. This is what wise people have wanted for a long time, but laws about religion have often been influenced by popular beliefs and excitement. 

The Independents, a group of very passionate people, wanted to create a system like this in England after the civil war. If they had succeeded, it could have led to a more peaceful and understanding approach to religion. This kind of system has worked in Pennsylvania, where even though Quakers are the biggest group, the law treats all groups equally. This has helped create a more peaceful and understanding environment.

Even if not all religious groups become calm and understanding, if there are enough of them and each is too small to cause trouble, then their strong beliefs won’t lead to big issues.
