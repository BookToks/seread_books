The Wealth of Nations

Instead of letting someone be judged by church courts, which wanted to keep their reputation intact, it was better to have them tried elsewhere. 

During the tenth to thirteenth centuries in Europe, the Roman Catholic Church was a major force against the government and the freedom and happiness of people. The church's power made it hard for civil government to protect people's rights. Many people believed in superstitions that the church supported, and this made it difficult for anyone to challenge those beliefs. Even if people started to see through the superstitions, they were still tied to their own interests, which made it tough to change things. If the church had only faced weak arguments from people, it might have lasted forever. 

However, over time, the church's stronghold began to weaken and is likely to eventually fall apart completely. 

As arts, trades, and business improved, the power of the wealthy landowners also declined. The clergy, like these landowners, found ways to trade their goods and started spending their money on themselves instead of helping others. Their generosity and hospitality became less common. As a result, they had fewer followers and eventually lost them all. The clergy also wanted to make more money from their land to spend on their own desires. To do this, they had to give leases to their tenants, making those tenants more independent. This broke the connections that tied the lower classes to the clergy, and these ties fell apart faster than those between the lower classes and the wealthy landowners.
