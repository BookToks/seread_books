The money that comes from corn rent used to be only a third of the total, but now, according to Dr. Blackstone, it’s usually about double what the other two-thirds make. The old money rents from colleges have dropped to about a fourth of what they used to be worth, or they’re worth just a little more than a fourth of the corn they used to be worth. Since the time of Philip and Mary, the value of English coins hasn’t changed much, and the same amount of pounds, shillings, and pence still has almost the same amount of pure silver. So, the drop in value of college money rents is mainly because silver is worth less now.

When you look at how much silver is worth and how much is actually in the coins, the loss can be even bigger. In Scotland, where the coins have changed a lot more than in England, and in France, where they’ve changed even more than in Scotland, some old rents that used to be valuable have dropped almost to nothing.

If you compare how much work you can get for the same amount of corn over time, it’s usually more consistent than with gold, silver, or other things. So, equal amounts of corn will be closer to having the same real value over time, meaning you can get about the same amount of work from it. But even corn doesn’t give you the exact same value every time. The real price of labor changes based on the situation; it’s usually higher in a growing society than in one that’s not moving forward, and higher in a society that’s not moving forward than in one that’s going backward. Other things can buy more or less labor depending on how much food they can buy at that time.

So, a rent paid in corn only changes based on how much labor a certain amount of corn can buy. But a rent paid in anything else can change based on how much labor that amount of corn can buy and how much corn can be bought with that other thing.

Even though the real value of corn rent changes less from century to century compared to money rent, it can change a lot more from year to year. The money price of...
