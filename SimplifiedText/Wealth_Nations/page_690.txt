Adam Smith talks about how people pay for their homes and how taxes can affect them differently. 

When someone lives in a house, they might have to give up some of their comfort to pay their share of taxes. The owner of the land also has to give up some of their money to pay taxes. How much each person pays can change based on different situations, and this can make things unfair for both the person living in the house and the landowner.

The unfairness in how taxes hit different landowners comes from how the costs are split. But for people living in different houses, the unfairness comes from another reason too. The amount of money people spend on rent compared to their total living costs varies. Rich people usually spend a smaller part of their money on rent, while for poorer people, rent takes up a big chunk of their income. Poor people struggle to buy food, so most of their money goes to that. Rich people, on the other hand, spend their money on luxuries, and a fancy house shows off their wealth. So, taxes on rent usually hit rich people harder, and it’s not unreasonable for them to pay more since they have more money.

Renting a house is a bit different from renting land. When you pay rent for land, it’s for something that can produce crops or resources. But paying rent for a house is for something that doesn’t create anything. So, the person paying rent has to get that money from somewhere else, like their job or other income. A tax on house rent affects the people living there, and they have to pay it from the same money they use to pay rent, whether it comes from their job, business profits, or land rent. This tax is similar to taxes on other things people buy. Overall, there isn’t really one single expense that shows how generous someone is.
