Adam Smith talks about how much money people make from mining metals. In places like Cuba, St. Domingo, and Peru, the value of metals is influenced by the best mines. Most mines only make enough money to cover their costs, so they don’t pay much rent to the landowners. This means that the rent isn’t a big part of the price for metals, especially precious ones. Most of the money comes from the work done and the profits made.

For example, in Cornwall, the tin mines are the richest known, and the average rent is about one-sixth of what they produce. Some mines pay more, and some pay less. The same goes for lead mines in Scotland, where the rent is also about one-sixth of the total output.

In Peru's silver mines, the owner often just asks the miner to use their mill to grind the ore and pay a small fee for it. Until 1736, the Spanish king took one-fifth of the silver produced as tax, which was like rent for the silver mines. If there hadn’t been a tax, the landowners would have made more money, and more mines could have been worked since they wouldn’t have to pay that tax. The tax on tin in Cornwall is thought to be over five percent, which would also go to the mine owner if there were no taxes.

When you compare the average rent from Cornwall’s tin mines to Peru’s silver mines, it’s about thirteen to twelve. However, the silver mines in Peru can’t even pay that low rent now, and the tax was lowered from one-fifth to one-tenth in 1736. This makes it easier for people to smuggle silver than tin, and the tax on silver is often not paid well, while the tax on tin is collected better. So, it looks like rent is a bigger part of the price of tin than it is for silver in the richest mines. After covering costs and profits, the remaining money for the mine owner is higher for tin.
