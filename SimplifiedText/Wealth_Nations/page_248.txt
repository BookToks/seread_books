Adam Smith

The paper money that was given to him never went over the amount of gold and silver he would have needed to keep on hand for unexpected expenses. So, the paper money he helped to circulate was never more than the gold and silver that would have been in the country if there was no paper money. The way he paid back the money regularly showed that the amount he borrowed never went beyond what he needed to keep as cash for emergencies. This cash was necessary so he could keep the rest of his money working for him. 

This part of his money is what keeps coming back to every seller as cash, whether it’s paper or coins, and it keeps going out the same way. If the bank had given him more money than this part of his capital, he wouldn’t have been able to pay back the bank as much as he borrowed over time. The money flowing into the bank from his business couldn’t be more than the money flowing out. If the bank gave out more paper money than the gold and silver he would have needed, it could soon be more than all the gold and silver that would have been in the country without paper money. This extra paper money would then come back to the bank to be exchanged for gold and silver. This second point was real, but maybe not everyone in the banks in Scotland understood it as well as the first point.

When traders in a country can avoid keeping a lot of cash on hand for unexpected needs, thanks to things like discounting bills and cash accounts, they shouldn’t expect more help from banks. Once banks have helped this much, they can’t go any further without risking their own safety and interests. A bank can’t give a trader all or most of the money they need to run their business because, even though that money keeps coming back to them, it also keeps going out.
