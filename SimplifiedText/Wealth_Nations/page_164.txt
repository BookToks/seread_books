The smart people of the time noticed some changes. These changes affected prices in different markets across the country, especially in London, where they had to get supplies from far away. In 1648, the price of the best wheat at Windsor market was £4:5s., and in 1649, it dropped to £4 for nine bushels. These prices were higher than £2:10s., which was the average price for the sixteen years before 1637. Even though these were the highest prices, they weren't the only ones that went up because of the civil wars.

Another important event was the reward for exporting corn that started in 1688. Many people believed this reward encouraged farmers to grow more corn, which could eventually lead to lower prices at home. However, between 1688 and 1700, there wasn't enough time for this to happen. Instead, the reward mostly helped export extra corn each year, which meant that when one year had a lot of corn, it didn’t help when another year had less. From 1693 to 1699, England faced a shortage of corn, mainly because of bad weather, but this shortage was made worse by the export reward. In 1699, they even stopped exporting corn for nine months.

There was also a third event during this time that didn’t cause a corn shortage but did affect prices. This was when the silver coins were damaged by clipping and wearing down. This problem started during Charles II's reign and got worse until 1695. By then, the silver coins were worth about 25% less than they should have been. The price of things in the market depends more on how much silver is actually in the coins, rather than how much it should be. So, when the coins were damaged, the prices went up.
