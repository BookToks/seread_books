Adam Smith talks about how treating slaves better makes them more loyal and smarter. When a master is kind, the slave acts more like a free servant and can even care about the master’s needs. This is something that usually happens with free workers, but not with slaves who are treated badly.

He believes that slaves have a better life under strict governments than under free ones. For example, in Roman times, the first time a ruler stepped in to protect a slave from a cruel master was during the emperors' rule. When a master named Vidius Pollio wanted to punish a slave by feeding him to fish, Emperor Augustus got really angry and ordered him to free that slave and all his other slaves. In the earlier republic, no official had the power to protect slaves or punish their masters.

Smith also points out that the sugar colonies in France, especially St. Domingo, grew mainly because of the hard work and smart farming of the colonists there. They used their land and skills to create wealth. In contrast, the sugar colonies in England relied a lot on resources sent from England, not just what they produced themselves. The success of the English colonies came from England's wealth spilling over to them. However, the French colonies thrived because of how well the colonists managed their slaves, which was better than how the English did it.

Overall, Smith suggests that European countries don’t have much to be proud of when it comes to how they set up and managed their American colonies.
