The Wealth of Nations talks about how trade works in different European countries, especially focusing on companies that have special rights. In many cases, if you want to trade with other countries, you need to join a specific company first. 

These companies can be strict about who gets to join, depending on how hard it is to become a member and how much power the leaders of the company have. In the past, if you trained as an apprentice under a member of the company, you could join without paying a big fee, or you might pay a smaller one than others. 

Usually, these companies try to limit competition by making lots of rules. If the law stops them from doing this, they often become less important. Some of the old companies still around in Great Britain today include the Hamburg Company, the Russia Company, the Eastland Company, the Turkey Company, and the African Company.

Right now, joining the Hamburg Company is pretty easy, and the leaders don’t seem to have the power to make annoying rules like they used to. In the past, though, it was tough. A long time ago, the fee to join was really high, and the company was known for being unfair. People from the west of England complained to the government about how the company was limiting trade and hurting local businesses. Even though nothing changed at that time, it likely made the company change its ways. Since then, there haven’t been any complaints about them. 

For the Russia Company, the joining fee was lowered to five pounds, and for the Eastland Company, it was cut to forty shillings.
