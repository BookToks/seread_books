Adam Smith talks about two types of capital: fixed and circulating. 

For a merchant, all his capital is circulating. He doesn’t need machines or tools for his business, except maybe his shop or warehouse. But for people like tailors or shoemakers, some of their capital is fixed in tools. A tailor only needs a few needles, while a shoemaker’s tools cost a bit more. Weavers need even more expensive tools. Most of what these workers spend is on paying their employees or buying materials, and they earn that money back when they sell their work.

In other industries, like ironworks, a lot more fixed capital is needed. They have expensive equipment like furnaces and forges. Coal mines also need costly machines for various tasks. 

For farmers, the capital used for farming tools is fixed, while the money spent on paying their workers is circulating capital. Farmers make money by owning their tools and by spending money on their workers. The value of their farm animals is fixed capital, just like their farming tools. But the money spent on feeding those animals is circulating capital. Farmers profit by keeping the animals and selling their food. 

When farmers raise animals for wool or milk, those animals are considered fixed capital because they’re not sold for labor. The profit comes from keeping them. The food for these animals is circulating capital, and farmers profit by selling it. The seeds used for planting are also fixed capital. Even though they move between the ground and storage, they don’t change owners, so they don’t really circulate. Farmers profit from seeds by growing more crops, not by selling the seeds themselves.

Overall, the total capital of a country is the same as the capital of all its people.
