A river with lots of branches or canals that flows into another area before reaching the sea isn’t very useful. This is because the countries that own that other area can block the way to the sea. For example, the Danube River doesn’t help Bavaria, Austria, and Hungary much because none of them controls the whole river until it reaches the Black Sea.

CHAPTER IV

When people start dividing up work, they can’t meet all their needs just by what they produce themselves. Most of what they need comes from trading what they make extra for things made by others. So, everyone ends up trading and acting a bit like merchants, and society becomes more about commerce.

But when people first started dividing work, trading was often really hard. Imagine one person has more of something than they need, and another person has less. The first person wants to sell some of their extra stuff, while the second person wants to buy it. But if the second person doesn’t have anything the first person wants, they can’t trade. For example, a butcher might have more meat than he can eat, and both the brewer and the baker would want to buy some.
