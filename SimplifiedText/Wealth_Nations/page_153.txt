In 1436, the government decided that wheat could be sold to other countries without a special permit if the price was really low, at six shillings and eightpence. Then in 1463, they made a rule that wheat couldn’t be brought into the country unless the price was higher than six shillings and eightpence. They thought that when the price was low, it was okay to sell it abroad, but when the price went up, it was better to let wheat come in.

Back then, six shillings and eightpence was seen as a fair price for wheat, which is about the same as thirteen shillings and fourpence today. In 1554 and again in 1558, the government banned exporting wheat if the price went over six shillings and eightpence, which was not much more than it is now. However, they soon realized that making it so cheap to export wheat was basically stopping it altogether. So, in 1562, they changed the rule to allow wheat to be exported from certain places as long as the price didn’t go over ten shillings, which is similar to what it is today. This new price was also seen as a fair price for wheat at that time.

In France, the average price of grain was much lower at the end of the 1400s and the start of the 1500s compared to the two centuries before. This was noted by some writers who studied grain prices. It seems that grain prices dropped across most of Europe during this time.

The increase in the value of silver compared to corn could be because more people wanted silver as farming improved, while the amount of silver available stayed the same. Or, it could be that the demand for silver stayed the same, but the supply went down because many silver mines were running out, making it more expensive to get silver. It might be a mix of both reasons.
