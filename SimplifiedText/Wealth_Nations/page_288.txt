Adam Smith

In any country, the amount of money people want to invest usually goes up as the economy grows. When more money is available, the amount of money that can be lent out also increases. This means that as more money is available, the interest rates, or the cost of borrowing that money, tend to go down. This happens not just because there’s more money, but also for other reasons specific to this situation.

As more money is available in a country, the profits from using that money start to go down. It gets harder to find good ways to invest new money. This leads to competition among people who have money, as they try to take over jobs or investments that others have. Often, the only way they can do this is by offering better deals. They might have to sell things for less money or sometimes buy them for more to make a sale.

As more funds are available to support jobs, the demand for workers keeps increasing. Workers can easily find jobs, but people with money struggle to find workers to hire. This competition raises wages for workers but lowers profits for investors. When profits are lower, the amount of interest that can be paid for borrowing money must also go down.

Some writers, like Mr. Locke and Mr. Montesquieu, thought that the increase in gold and silver from the Spanish West Indies was the main reason interest rates dropped in Europe. They believed that since gold and silver became less valuable, the cost of borrowing them also went down. This idea seems reasonable at first, but Mr. Hume has shown that it’s not quite right.

Before the discovery of the Spanish West Indies, interest rates were usually around ten percent in most of Europe. Since then, in different countries, those rates have dropped.
