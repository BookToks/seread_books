The Wealth of Nations

Most European ships that go to India usually carry silver because it's super valuable. The ships from Acapulco to Manilla also have a lot of silver. This silver from the Americas is really important for trade between different parts of the world, helping connect faraway places.

To keep up with the huge demand for silver, the amount mined each year needs to be enough not just for new coins and silver items in growing countries, but also to replace the silver that gets used up. Silver wears down when it's used as coins and gets damaged when silver items are worn or cleaned. Because silver is used so much, we need a lot of it every year. 

In Birmingham, for example, a lot of gold and silver is used for coating other items, and this amounts to over fifty thousand pounds every year. This gives us an idea of how much silver is used around the world in things like fancy fabrics, decorations, and even in books and furniture. Also, some silver gets lost when it's moved from one place to another, whether by land or sea. In many Asian countries, people often hide their treasures underground, and when they die, that knowledge goes with them, causing even more silver to be lost.

Every year, around six million pounds worth of gold and silver comes into Cadiz and Lisbon, including both registered and smuggled amounts. According to Mr. Meggens, over an average of six years, Spain imports a lot of precious metals.
