In a simple society before trade and factories got better, people didn’t know about fancy things that come from trade. If someone had a lot of money back then, they could only use it to take care of a lot of people. Having a lot of money really just meant having a lot of basic stuff to live on. 

In those times, people usually got paid in food, clothes, and animals like cows and sheep. If they couldn’t trade these things for something else, the only option was to use the extra to feed and clothe more people. Rich people spent their money on being nice and welcoming, but they didn’t usually go broke doing this. 

Sometimes, people ruin themselves chasing after silly pleasures, like cock-fighting, but it’s rare for someone to go broke just from being generous. Back in the days of feudal lords, families kept their land for a long time, showing that people generally tried to live within their means. 

Even though the way rich landowners shared food might not seem smart today, they usually didn’t spend all their money. They sold some of their wool and hides for cash. They might have bought a few fancy things with that money, but they also saved a lot of it. Back then, trading was seen as shameful for gentlemen, and lending money for interest was frowned upon.
