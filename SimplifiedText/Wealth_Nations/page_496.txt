When profits are really high, it often makes business owners forget about saving money. Instead of being careful with their spending, they tend to go for expensive luxuries that match their wealth. The people who own big businesses are usually the ones who lead the economy of their country. Their behavior influences everyone else who works for them more than anyone else’s actions do.

If a boss is careful with money, their workers are likely to be careful too. But if the boss spends money wildly and doesn’t care, the workers will probably follow that example in their own lives. This means that the people who should be saving money and building wealth are actually spending it all, which stops the country’s overall wealth from growing. Instead of increasing, the country’s wealth shrinks, and there are fewer jobs available over time.

Take a look at the merchants in Cadiz and Lisbon. Have their huge profits helped Spain and Portugal get richer? Have they made life better for the people there? It seems like the way they spend their money has done the opposite. Those big profits haven’t even been enough to keep their businesses running. More and more foreign businesses are coming into Cadiz and Lisbon because the local ones can’t keep up. To push out these foreign businesses, the Spanish and Portuguese are trying to tighten their control over trade, even if it doesn’t make sense.

If you compare how merchants act in Cadiz and Lisbon to those in Amsterdam, you’ll see a big difference based on how much money they make. Merchants in London aren’t as flashy as those in Cadiz and Lisbon, but they also aren’t as careful with their money as those in Amsterdam. Many London merchants are thought to be wealthier than most in Cadiz and Lisbon, but not as rich as some in Amsterdam. However, they usually make less profit than the merchants in Cadiz and Lisbon.
