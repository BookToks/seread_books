It seems that students should really know the difference between good and bad reasoning before they start thinking about important topics.

In the past, philosophy was divided into three parts, but most universities in Europe changed it to five parts.

In ancient philosophy, everything taught about the human mind or God was part of physics. These ideas were seen as important parts of the universe and had big effects. What people could figure out or guess about them made up two important chapters in the study of the universe's origins and changes. But in European universities, where philosophy was mainly taught to support theology, they focused more on these two chapters than on anything else. Over time, these chapters got longer and were split into many smaller sections. Eventually, the study of spirits, which is hard to understand, took up as much space in philosophy as the study of physical bodies, which is easier to understand. These two subjects became seen as separate sciences. 

What we call metaphysics, or pneumatics, was compared to physics and was thought to be not only more advanced but also more useful for certain jobs. The subjects that could be tested and observed, which could lead to many useful discoveries, were mostly ignored. Instead, the topics that were complicated and unclear, which often led to confusing arguments, were studied a lot.

When these two sciences were set against each other, it naturally led to a third one called ontology. This science looked at the qualities and traits that both subjects shared. But if the metaphysics or pneumatics taught in schools were mostly confusing arguments, then ontology was just a web of those same confusing ideas.

The ancient moral philosophy aimed to explore what made a person happy and fulfilled, not just as an individual but also as part of a family, a state, and the larger society of humans.
