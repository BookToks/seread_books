Adam Smith says that to improve trade, we need good roads and canals. However, in Europe, most government money doesn’t come from taxes on land. While the land does provide a lot of resources, it's not the main way governments get money. Because of this, European leaders don’t feel the need to focus on increasing the amount and value of what the land produces or to build good roads and canals to help sell those products.

In some parts of Asia, local governments do a good job managing public services, but it’s unlikely that this would work well in Europe right now. Public projects that don’t make money but are useful for specific areas are usually better managed by local governments instead of the central government. For example, if London’s streets were fixed and lit using money from the national treasury, they probably wouldn’t be as well maintained as they are now. Plus, the money would come from taxes on everyone in the country, even those who don’t benefit from London’s streets.

Even though local governments can make mistakes with their money, those problems are usually small compared to the big issues that happen in a large empire’s finances. Local issues are also easier to fix. In Britain, for example, the local justices ask country people to help fix the roads, and while it might not always be done perfectly, it’s rarely done in a harsh way. In France, however, the local officials can be much stricter and unfair when they ask for help, which can lead to serious problems for the people.
