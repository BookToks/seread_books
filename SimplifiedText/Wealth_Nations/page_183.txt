The Wealth of Nations

Silver has become cheaper, meaning it buys less work than before. But some things have become more expensive, meaning they buy more work than before. It’s not just about their price tag; it’s about how much they’re really worth that goes up as things improve. The increase in their price is because their real value is rising, not because silver has lost value.

There are three types of basic products that react differently to improvements in wealth. 

The first type includes things that we can’t really produce more of, no matter how hard we try. The second type includes things we can produce more of if there’s more demand. The third type includes things where how much we can produce is uncertain or limited. 

For the first type, the price can go really high without any clear limit. For the second type, the price can also go up a lot, but there’s a point where it can’t go much higher for a long time. For the third type, the price usually goes up as things improve, but sometimes it can drop, stay the same, or go up and down depending on how successful we are at producing them.

The first type of basic product is hard to produce more of. These are things that nature only makes in limited amounts, and they can spoil quickly, so we can’t store them from different seasons. This includes rare birds, fish, and wild game. As people get richer and want more luxury items, the demand for these things goes up. But no matter how much people want them, we can’t really make more of them. So, if the number of these items stays the same while more people want to buy them, their prices can go really high without any clear limit. For example, if woodcocks became super trendy and sold for twenty guineas each, we couldn’t bring many more to the market than we do now. In ancient Rome, people paid a lot for rare birds and fish when they were at their peak.
