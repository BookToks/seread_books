The Wealth of Nations

During the recent war, a lot of gold and silver was sent out of the country without bringing anything back, as noted by the author of the Present State of the Nation.

In big trading countries, there’s a lot of gold and silver that gets moved around for international trade. This gold and silver, which is called bullion, works like money between different countries, just like regular money works within a country. The regular money is used for buying and selling things inside a country, while the bullion helps with trade between countries. Both types of money help people trade, but one is for local trades and the other is for international ones. Some of this international money was probably used to help pay for the recent war.

When there’s a big war, it makes sense that money would be used differently than during peaceful times. It would likely be spent more around the war zones and nearby countries to pay for soldiers and supplies. However, whatever money Britain used for the war had to be bought with British goods or something that was bought with those goods. This means we always come back to the idea that the country’s goods and the work done by its people are what really helped fund the war. 

It’s reasonable to think that such a huge expense each year had to come from a lot of goods produced. For example, in 1761, the cost was over £19,000,000. No amount of savings could cover such a big yearly expense. Even the total amount of gold and silver brought into Spain and Portugal each year is usually around £6,000,000, which wouldn’t even cover four months of war expenses.

The best things to send to faraway countries to buy supplies for an army or to get more international money are usually high-quality manufactured goods. These goods are valuable but don’t take up much space, so they can be shipped long distances without costing too much. A country that makes a lot of these valuable goods each year usually exports them to other countries.
