Adam Smith

When wages go up, it might seem like people are getting paid more, but sometimes they really aren’t. The profits from investments aren’t just about how much money you get paid; it’s more about how that money compares to the total amount of money being used. For example, in one country, workers might earn 5 shillings a week, and investors might expect a 10% profit. But if the total amount of money in the country stays the same, then the competition between different investors will also stay the same. Everyone will have the same chances and challenges. So, the usual relationship between money and profit will remain unchanged, and the usual interest rates will also stay the same because what you can earn from money will influence what you have to pay to borrow it.

If the amount of goods being sold in a country increases while the amount of money stays the same, it can lead to some important changes, including making money more valuable. Even if the total amount of money looks the same, it can actually be more powerful. It can pay for more work, which means there will be a higher demand for workers. As more people want to work, wages might go up, but they could also seem lower. You might get paid less money, but that money could buy more stuff than before. The profits for investors might actually go down, both in reality and how it looks. Since the total money in the country has increased, the competition among investors will also increase. Those investors will have to settle for a smaller share of the profits from the workers they hire. The interest rates on loans might drop significantly, even though the value of money, or how much stuff you can buy with a certain amount, has gone up.

In some places, laws have banned charging interest on loans. But since money can always be used to make something, there should be some cost for borrowing it. Instead of solving the problem, these laws often make it worse. Borrowers end up paying not just for using the money, but also for the risk the lender takes by lending it.
