Adam Smith talked about how taxes and church money affect the government. 

For example, the tithe is a tax on land that makes it harder for landowners to help pay for the defense of the country. Some people believe that the rent from land is the main source of money for the government. The more money that goes to the church, the less there is for the government. Basically, if the church gets richer, either the government or the people will end up poorer, which means the country will be less able to protect itself.

In some Protestant countries, especially in Switzerland, the money that used to go to the Catholic Church is now enough to pay the church leaders and cover other government costs without needing extra money. For instance, the leaders in the strong canton of Berne have saved a lot of money from this fund, which they use to invest in different countries, mainly France and Great Britain.

I’m not sure how much the church costs the state in Berne or other Protestant areas. But back in 1755, the total income of the Scottish church, including their land and houses, was around £68,514. This amount supports about 944 ministers. The total cost of the church, including building and fixing churches and ministers' homes, probably doesn’t go over £85,000 a year. 

Even though the Scottish church doesn’t have a lot of money, it still keeps people faithful and moral, just like wealthier churches do. The Scottish church has the same positive effects on society and religion as any other church. Many Protestant churches in Switzerland, which also don’t have much money, do even better in keeping their communities strong. In most Protestant areas, everyone is part of the established church.
