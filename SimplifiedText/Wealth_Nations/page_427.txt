The Wealth of Nations

People rely on their landlord or manager for help. If we could change everything at once and get all the farming resources in the country focused on growing food instead of other jobs, it would really improve the country quickly.

The law from Edward VI tried to stop middlemen from getting in the way between farmers and buyers. This was important because having a direct trade helps during food shortages and prevents them from happening. After farmers, corn merchants are the next most important for growing food.

Later laws made it easier to buy and sell corn when prices were low. Eventually, a law during Charles II's time allowed people to buy corn to sell it again as long as the price didn’t go over a certain amount. This law gave corn dealers more freedom to operate.

However, this law also supports two silly beliefs. First, it assumes that when wheat prices go above a certain point, it will hurt people. But it’s clear that corn dealers can’t hurt people, no matter the price. Even when prices are high, like after a bad harvest, it’s not realistic to think that there’s enough corn to be sold to cause harm.
