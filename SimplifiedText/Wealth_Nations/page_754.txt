In 1701, some taxes were extended until August 1, 1710, and this was called the second general mortgage or fund. The money that was missing added up to £2,055,999: 7: 11½.

In 1707, those taxes were extended again for new loans until August 1, 1712, and this was called the third general mortgage or fund. The amount borrowed was £983,254:11:9¼.

In 1708, most of those taxes were continued until August 1, 1714, except for an old tax on tonnage and poundage, and a tax on importing Scotch linen that was removed. This was called the fourth general mortgage or fund, and the amount borrowed was £925,176:9:2¼.

In 1709, those taxes were continued until August 1, 1716, again excluding the old tonnage and poundage tax. This was called the fifth general mortgage or fund, and the amount borrowed was £922,029:6s.

In 1710, the taxes were extended again until August 1, 1720, and this was called the sixth general mortgage or fund. The amount borrowed was £1,296,552:9:11¾.

In 1711, the same taxes, which were now part of four different loans, were made permanent. They were used to pay the interest on a huge loan of £9,177,967:15:4d from the South Sea Company, which was the biggest loan ever at that time.

Before this, the only taxes that were permanently set to pay off debts were those for money borrowed from the bank and the East India Company. The bank fund was £3,375,027:17:10½, with an interest payment of £206,501:15:5d. The East India fund was £3,200,000, with an interest payment of £160,000. The bank fund had a 6% interest rate, while the East India fund had a 5% rate.

In 1715, under George I, the different taxes that were used to pay the bank’s interest, along with some new ones, were combined into one fund called the aggregate.
