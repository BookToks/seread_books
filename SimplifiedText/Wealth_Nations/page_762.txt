before the breaking out of the late war, the funded debt of Great
Britain amounted to £72,289,675. On the 5th of January 1763,
at the conclusion of the peace, the funded debt amounted debt to
£122,603,336:8:2¼. The unfunded debt has been stated at
£13,927,589:2:2. But the expense occasioned by the war did not
end with the conclusion of the peace; so that, though on the 5th
of January 1764, the funded debt was increased (partly by a new
loan, and partly by funding a part of the unfunded debt) to
£129,586,789:10:1¾, there still remained (according to the very
well informed author of Considerations on the T rade and Finances
of Great Britain) an unfunded debt, which was brought to ac-
count in that and the following year, of £9,975,017: 12:2 15/44d.
In 1764, therefore, the public debt of Great Britain, funded and
unfunded together, amounted, according to this author, to
£139,561,807:2:4. The annuities for lives, too, which had been
granted as premiums to the subscribers to the new loans in 1757,
estimated at fourteen years purchase, were valued at £472,500;
and the annuities for long terms of years, granted as premiums
likewise, in 1761 and 1762, estimated at twenty-seven and a-half
years purchase, were valued at £6,826,875. During a peace of about
seven years continuance, the prudent and truly patriotic adminis-
tration of Mr. Pelham was not able to pay off an old debt of six
millions. During a war of nearly the same continuance, a new
debt of more than seventy-five millions was contracted.
On the 5th of January 1775, the funded debt of Great Britain
amounted to £124,996,086, 1:6¼d. The unfunded, exclusive of
a large civil-list debt, to £4,150,236:3:11 7/8. Both together, to
£129,146,322:5:6. According to this account, the whole debt paid
off, during eleven years of profound peace, amounted only to
£10,415,476:16:9 7/8. Even this small reduction of debt, how-
ever, has not been all made from the savings out of the ordinary
revenue of the state. Several extraneous sums, altogether indepen-
dent of that ordinary revenue, have contributed towards it.
Amongst these we may reckon an additional shilling in the pound
land tax, for three years; the two millions received from the East-
India company, as indemnification for their territorial acquisitions;
and the one hundred and ten thousand pounds received from the
bank for the renewal of their charter. To these must be added sev-
eral other sums, which, as they arose out of the late war, ought
perhaps to be considered as deductions from the expenses of it.
