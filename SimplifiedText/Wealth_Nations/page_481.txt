The Wealth of Nations

Every country could have benefited from trade, but England put itself at a disadvantage in almost every other type of trade.

When England took control of the colony trade, other countries had to pull their money out of it. Before, England only handled part of the trade, but now it had to manage all of it. The money that used to bring some goods to the colonies was now the only money supplying everything they needed from Europe. But England couldn't provide everything, and the goods they did supply were sold at high prices. The money that used to buy some of the colonies' extra products was now the only money buying all of it. But it couldn't buy everything at the old prices, so whatever it did buy was very cheap. 

In a situation where merchants sold things for a lot and bought them for very little, the profits were huge and higher than usual in other trades. This higher profit in the colony trade attracted money from other trades. As more money went into the colony trade, competition increased there, while it decreased in other trades. This meant profits in the colony trade went up, while profits in other trades went down until everything reached a new balance, which was a bit higher than before.

This effect of pulling money from other trades and raising profits in all trades started when England took control of the colonies and has continued ever since.

This monopoly has kept taking money from other trades to use in the colonies. Even though Great Britain's wealth has grown a lot since the navigation act, it hasn't grown as fast as the colonies' wealth. Usually, a country's foreign trade grows with its wealth, and since Britain took almost all the foreign trade from the colonies, it couldn't keep up without taking money from other trades.
