Adam Smith talks about how the value of silver and corn can change based on supply and demand. 

If more people want silver but there isn’t enough of it, the price of silver will go up compared to corn. This means you could trade less silver for more corn, making corn cheaper in terms of silver. 

On the other hand, if there’s suddenly a lot more silver available than people want, the price of silver will drop. This would mean you would need more silver to buy the same amount of corn, making corn more expensive. 

If the amount of silver and the demand for it grow at the same rate, then the price of silver will stay about the same when trading for corn. This means corn prices won’t change much either, even with improvements in farming or trade.

These three situations cover all the ways prices can change as things improve over time. Looking at history from the last four hundred years in places like France and Great Britain, we can see that all three situations have happened in a similar order.

In the first period, around 1350, the price of a quarter of wheat in England was about four ounces of silver, which is like twenty shillings today. Then, the price dropped to two ounces of silver, or about ten shillings, by the early 1500s and stayed that way until around 1570.

In 1350, there was a law called the Statute of Labourers because workers were trying to demand higher wages. The law said that workers had to stick to the same pay and food they were used to getting before.
