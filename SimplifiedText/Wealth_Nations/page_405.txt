The Wealth of Nations

Bounties, like other tricks of the mercantile system, only push a country's trade into a less profitable direction than it would naturally go.

The smart author of the Tracts on the Corn Trade has shown that since the bounty for exporting corn started, the price of exported corn has been higher than imported corn by a lot more than the total amount of bounties paid during that time. He thinks this proves that the forced corn trade is good for the country, since the value of what we export is way more than what we import, even after considering the extra money spent to get it exported.

But he doesn’t think about how the bounty is just a small part of the total cost of exporting corn. We also need to consider the money farmers spent to grow it. If the price of corn sold in other countries doesn’t cover not just the bounty but also the farmer's costs and normal profits, then the society loses money, and the national wealth goes down. The reason for giving a bounty is because people think the price isn’t high enough to cover these costs.

People have said that the average price of corn has dropped a lot since the bounty was introduced. I’ve already pointed out that the average price started to fall towards the end of the last century and has kept falling for the first sixty-four years of this one. If this is true, it happened despite the bounty, not because of it. This has also happened in France, where there was no bounty and, until 1764, exporting corn was banned. So, this drop in the average price of grain is likely due to a slow increase in the real value of silver in the European market during this century. It seems impossible that the bounty could ever help lower the price of grain.

In good years, the bounty causes a lot of corn to be exported, which keeps the price of corn at home higher than it would normally be.
