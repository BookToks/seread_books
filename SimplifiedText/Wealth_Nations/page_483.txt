The Wealth of Nations

Back in the day, places like Nova Scotia weren't really developed. But Virginia, Maryland, and New England were doing well as colonies. Even though they were successful, no one at the time thought they would grow so quickly in wealth, population, and progress. The only British colony that looked anything like it does now was Barbados.

At that time, England didn't have much of the trade from its colonies, even after the navigation laws were put in place. Those laws weren't really enforced for a while. The trade that helped England's naval power came mainly from Europe and the Mediterranean area. But now, the share of that trade that Great Britain has wouldn't be enough to support a strong navy. If other countries had been allowed to trade freely with the colonies, Great Britain would have still gotten a good amount of that trade, but it would have just added to what they already had.

Because of the monopoly on colony trade, the growth of that trade didn't really add to what Great Britain already had; it just changed where the trade was going. 

This monopoly also kept profits in British trade higher than they would have been if everyone could trade freely with the colonies. The monopoly pulled more money into the colony trade than would have happened naturally and pushed out foreign investments. This meant that the total amount of money used in that trade was lower than it could have been with free trade. But since there was less competition for that money, profits in that area went up. 

Also, because there was less competition for British money in other types of trade, profits in those areas went up too. No matter what the situation was with British trade money since the navigation laws were set, the monopoly on colony trade made profits higher than they would have been otherwise, both in that trade and in all other British trade areas.
