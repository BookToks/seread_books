Not many countries have fully embraced a free trade system for corn. Most places have rules that limit how corn can be traded, which can make bad situations, like a shortage, even worse and lead to famine. Sometimes, a nearby small country that is also facing a shortage might hesitate to help because it could end up in the same trouble. Poor decisions in one country can make it risky for another country to follow better policies.

In bigger countries like France or England, allowing free export of corn is usually less risky because they grow a lot more, so exporting some won’t really affect their supply. In smaller places, like a Swiss canton or some small Italian states, it might be necessary to limit corn exports. Stopping farmers from selling their goods to the best market is unfair and should only happen in emergencies. If exports are ever banned, it should only be when prices are really high.

The rules about corn are similar to rules about religion. People care a lot about their food and happiness, so the government often has to go along with what they believe to keep peace. That’s probably why we rarely see sensible rules about these important topics.

The business of transporting corn from one place to another helps keep the local market well-supplied. Even though the main goal of this business isn’t to sell corn locally, the merchant usually prefers to do so for less money than they could get elsewhere because it saves them the costs of shipping. The people in the country that acts as a hub for corn trade usually don’t run out of food. While this trade can lower the average price of corn locally, it doesn’t actually decrease its real value.
