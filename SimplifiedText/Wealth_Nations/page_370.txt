Adam Smith says that when there are a lot of buyers in the market, sellers can charge higher prices. Foreign ships can come to Britain to sell goods without any extra costs. In the past, there was a tax on all goods that were exported, but now most of those taxes have been removed. However, if foreign sellers can't come to sell their goods because of high taxes or bans, they won't come to buy either. This is because they would lose money by traveling to Britain without anything to sell. So, if there are fewer sellers, there will be fewer buyers, which means we might end up paying more for foreign goods and getting less for our own. But since protecting the country is more important than making money, the navigation laws might be the smartest trade rules in England.

Another situation where it makes sense to tax foreign goods is when there’s already a tax on local products. It seems fair to tax foreign products the same way. This wouldn’t give local businesses total control over the market, nor would it force too many resources into one area. It would just stop some local products from being pushed away by the tax and keep the competition between local and foreign goods as fair as possible. In Britain, when a tax is put on local products, they often add a bigger tax on foreign goods to calm down complaints from local sellers who worry about being undercut.

Some people believe that when taxes are placed on basic necessities, it’s fair to tax not just similar necessities from abroad but also any foreign goods that compete with local products. They argue that when taxes make basic needs more expensive, the cost of living goes up, and so does the cost of labor. Therefore, even if local products aren’t directly taxed, they still become more expensive because of these taxes.
