Adam Smith

Great Britain can only bring in a certain amount of wine from Portugal, and it has to be less than what they would pay for French wine after taking off a third of the tax. If this tax break is ever messed with, then Portugal can stop importing British wool and other wool products.

The important leaders promise that their bosses will agree to this deal, and they will finalize it within two months. 

With this agreement, Portugal has to allow British wool products in without raising the taxes that were paid before. However, they don’t have to give British wool any better deal than what they give to other countries like France or Holland. On the other hand, Great Britain has to let Portuguese wines in for only two-thirds of the tax they charge on French wines, which are the main competition. So, this deal is definitely better for Portugal and not so great for Great Britain.

Still, it has been praised as a smart move for England's trade. Portugal gets a lot of gold from Brazil every year, more than they can use at home. This extra gold is too valuable to just sit around, so they have to send it abroad to trade for things that are more useful back home. A lot of this gold comes to England in exchange for British goods or goods from other European countries that go through England. Someone mentioned that the weekly boat from Lisbon brings over £50,000 in gold to England. This amount might be a bit exaggerated, but it would add up to more than £2,600,000 a year, which is more than Brazil can actually provide.

A few years ago, British merchants were unhappy with the Portuguese crown. Some benefits they had were given not by a treaty but as a favor from the crown, likely because they had done something much bigger in return.
