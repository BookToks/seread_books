Adam Smith

This difference was really important, and because of it, people slowly gave up their power and control just to satisfy their own silly and selfish desires. 

In a country without trade with other countries or fancy products, a person making £10,000 a year can only really use that money to support about 1,000 families that work for him. But today in Europe, someone with that same income can spend all of it without actually taking care of more than twenty people or needing more than ten servants, who aren't even that valuable. 

Even though he spends a lot, he might actually support just as many, or even more, people than he could have in the past. This is because the things he buys are expensive, and the high prices come from the wages of the workers who made them and the profits of their bosses. By paying these prices, he helps pay those workers and their employers. However, he usually only contributes a tiny bit to each person's overall support. For some, it might be less than a tenth of what they need in a year. So, while he helps everyone, they don’t really depend on him because they can survive without him.

When rich landowners spend their money on their tenants and workers, they fully support their own people. But when they spend it on tradespeople and craftsmen, together they might support just as many, or even more, people than before. Still, each landowner only helps a little bit for each person in that larger group. Each tradesperson gets their living from many different customers, not just one. So, while they owe something to everyone, they aren't completely reliant on any single person.

As the rich landowners started spending more on themselves, they slowly needed fewer workers, and eventually, they let a lot of them go. This also made them get rid of some of their tenants. Farms got bigger, and the people working the land, despite their complaints, had to adapt.
