The Wealth of Nations

Back in the day, the government in Flanders, which was controlled by Spain, stopped English wool clothes from coming in. In 1700, they allowed bone lace to come into England again, but only if England let their wool clothes back into Flanders like before.

Sometimes, it makes sense to fight back when another country puts high taxes or bans on our stuff. If we can get back a big foreign market, it usually makes up for a short time when we have to pay more for some goods. Figuring out if fighting back will work isn’t really the job of lawmakers, who should stick to general rules. It’s more about the tricky politicians who change their minds based on what’s happening right now.

If there’s no chance of getting rid of the other country’s ban, then it’s not smart to hurt ourselves by banning their stuff too. When our neighbors stop buying something from us, we usually ban not just that item, but other things they sell as well. This might help some workers here, but it doesn’t help those who were hurt by the neighbors' ban. In fact, it makes everyone else pay more for certain goods. So, every law like this is like a tax on the whole country, not just helping the workers who got hurt, but benefiting a different group instead.

Sometimes, we have to think about how to bring back the free import of foreign goods after it’s been stopped for a while. This is especially true when certain industries have grown a lot because of high taxes or bans on foreign goods. We might need to slowly bring back free trade to avoid hurting a lot of people all at once. If we removed those high taxes and bans suddenly, cheaper foreign goods could flood the market and put many people out of work.
