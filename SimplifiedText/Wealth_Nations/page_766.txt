Adam Smith

I’ve already talked a lot about this system, so I won’t go into too much detail. But it’s important to note that not all of our public debt is owed to people in our country. Countries like the Netherlands own a big part of our public funds. Even if all the debt was owed to people here, it would still be a problem.

Land and capital stock are the main sources of money for everyone, both private and public. Capital stock pays workers in farming, factories, or businesses. Different groups manage these two sources: landowners take care of land, and capital stock owners manage their money.

Landowners want to keep their land in good shape because it helps them earn money. They need to fix up houses for tenants, build drains, and make other important improvements. But if taxes on land are too high, it can cut into their income, making it hard for them to afford these improvements. If landowners stop taking care of their land, tenants can’t keep up either. If landowners struggle, farming in the country will suffer.

When taxes on everyday items get too high, owners of capital stock realize that their money doesn’t buy as much here as it would in other places. This might make them want to leave. If merchants and manufacturers, who are the big employers, keep getting bothered by tax collectors, they might actually decide to move away. If they leave, the country’s economy will decline because the businesses that rely on that capital will fail, leading to a collapse in trade and farming. 

We need to make sure that the people who own land and capital stock are supported so they can take care of their properties and manage their money well.
