The Wealth of Nations

For a small cost, the community can help everyone get the important education they need. 

The community can make this easier by setting up small schools in every neighborhood where kids can learn for a price that even a regular worker can pay. The teacher would get some money from the community, but not all of it, because if they were paid too much, they might not care about their job. In Scotland, these small schools have taught almost everyone to read, and many can also write and do math. In England, charity schools have had a similar effect, but not as widely because they’re not everywhere. 

If the books used in these schools were a bit better, and instead of teaching kids some Latin, which isn’t very useful for them, they learned basic geometry and mechanics, then the education for these kids would be really good. Most jobs have ways to use geometry and mechanics, which would help regular people get better at these important skills. 

The community can also encourage kids to learn by giving out small rewards or badges to those who do really well in school. 

The community can make it necessary for almost everyone to get this important education by requiring people to pass a test before they can join any group or start a business in a town. 

This is similar to how the Greek and Roman societies kept their citizens ready for battle. They made it easier for people to learn military skills by having specific places for training and allowing certain teachers to teach there. These teachers didn’t seem to have salaries or special privileges; they were rewarded based on what they earned from their students.
