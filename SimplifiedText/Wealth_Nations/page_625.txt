The Wealth of Nations

Church schools were started by the pope and were protected by him. This meant that everyone involved, whether they were teachers or students, didn’t have to follow the regular laws of the country where their universities were located. Instead, they only had to answer to church rules. Most of what was taught at these universities was about religion or stuff that helped prepare for studying religion.

When Christianity became the official religion, a messed-up version of Latin was the main language in Western Europe. Church services and Bible readings were done in this Latin, which was the everyday language of the people back then. After the barbarian invasions that destroyed the Roman Empire, Latin slowly stopped being spoken in Europe. However, people still respected the old church traditions, even when the reasons for them were no longer relevant. So, even though most people didn’t understand Latin anymore, church services continued to be held in that language. This created two separate languages in Europe: one for priests and one for everyone else, like a sacred language and a regular language. 

Priests needed to know some Latin to do their jobs, so learning Latin became a key part of university education. This wasn’t the case for Greek or Hebrew. The church decided that the Latin version of the Bible, known as the Latin Vulgate, was just as important as the original Greek and Hebrew texts. Because of this, knowing Greek and Hebrew wasn’t necessary for church leaders, so studying them wasn’t a big part of university education for a long time. Some universities in Spain still don’t include Greek in their courses. 

When the first reformers came along, they found that the original Greek New Testament and Hebrew Old Testament supported their ideas better than the Latin translation, which had been changed over time to back up Catholic beliefs. So, they worked to point out the mistakes in that translation, which put pressure on the Roman Catholic clergy.
