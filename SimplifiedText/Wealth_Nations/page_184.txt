The prices back then can be explained easily. They weren't low because silver was cheap, but because rare things were really valuable and hard to find. The value of silver in Rome was actually higher before and after the republic fell than it is in most of Europe today. For example, the Roman republic paid about three sestertii, which is like sixpence, for a peck of wheat from Sicily. This price was probably lower than what wheat usually sold for because the farmers had to deliver it at that price, almost like a tax.

When the Romans needed more wheat than what they were required to give, they had to pay four sestertii, or eightpence, for the extra. This was seen as a fair price back then, which is about twenty-one shillings for a quarter. Before recent years of shortage, the usual price for English wheat was twenty-eight shillings for a quarter, but Sicilian wheat was better quality and usually sold for more in Europe.

So, in those ancient times, silver was worth about three-quarters of what it is today. This means that three ounces of silver back then could buy the same amount of stuff as four ounces can now. When we read about Seius buying a white nightingale for six thousand sestertii, which is like fifty pounds today, or Asinius Celer buying a surmullet for eight thousand sestertii, about sixty-six pounds, those prices seem crazy. But really, they were about a third more expensive than they look to us now.

Seius spent what would be like £66.13.4 today for the nightingale, and Asinius spent about £88.17.9 for the surmullet. The high prices weren't just because silver was plentiful, but because the Romans had a lot of extra labor and food that they didn't need for themselves. They actually had less silver than what they could have gotten for the same amount of labor and food.
