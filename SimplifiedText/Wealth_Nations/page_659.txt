In Europe, there wasn't a main court or council that could solve all the arguments between countries like the court of Rome could. So, when people who followed the Reformation in one country disagreed with those in another, they had no one to turn to for help, and their arguments could never be settled. This led to a lot of disagreements, especially about how the church should be run and who should get church jobs. These issues created two main groups among the Reformation followers: the Lutherans and the Calvinists. These were the only groups that had their beliefs and rules officially recognized by law in Europe.

The Lutherans and the Church of England kept some form of church government that had bishops in charge. They made sure that the king or queen had control over church positions and jobs, making them the real leaders of the church. While bishops could still appoint people to smaller church jobs, the king or queen and other important people also had a say in who got those jobs. This way of running the church helped keep peace and order in society and didn’t cause any major problems in the countries where it was used. The Church of England, in particular, has always been proud of its loyalty to the crown.

With this kind of church government, the clergy tried to get on the good side of the king or queen and the wealthy people in the country because that’s how they could get better jobs. They often flattered these powerful people, but they also worked hard to impress them by being knowledgeable, friendly, and polite. They avoided the strict and fake behaviors that some fanatics showed to gain respect, which made them more liked by the wealthy, who didn't want to be associated with those extremes. However, while trying to win favor this way, the clergy also had to be careful.
