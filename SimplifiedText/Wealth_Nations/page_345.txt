The Wealth of Nations

The merchants knew how to make money for themselves, and that was their main focus. But they didn’t really think about how their actions affected the country. They only thought about it when they needed to ask the government to change laws about foreign trade. When that happened, they had to talk about how foreign trade was good for the country and how the current laws were getting in the way. 

The judges who made decisions were happy to hear that foreign trade brought money into the country, but that the laws were stopping it from bringing in even more. So, these arguments worked, and the rules about exporting gold and silver changed. In France and England, they only stopped the export of their own coins, but allowed foreign coins and gold to be exported. In places like Holland, they even allowed their own coins to be exported freely. 

The government shifted its focus from stopping gold and silver from leaving the country to worrying about the balance of trade, which was a more complicated issue. The idea from Mun’s book, "England’s Treasure in Foreign Trade," became a key belief not just in England, but in many other trading countries too. They thought that local trade was less important than foreign trade, even though local trade could actually bring in more money and jobs for people. They believed local trade didn’t really affect the country’s wealth directly, except for how it might impact foreign trade.

A country without its own gold and silver has to get it from other countries, just like a country without vineyards has to buy wine. But the government doesn’t need to focus more on getting gold and silver than on getting wine. A country that can afford to buy wine will always get it, and the same goes for gold and silver. They can be bought for a price, just like everything else. Since gold and silver are the price for all other goods, all other goods can also be seen as the price for those metals. We believe that free trade, without any restrictions, will work well.
