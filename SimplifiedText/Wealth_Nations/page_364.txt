If a country uses its resources in a way that doesn't make the most sense, it won't get as much value from what it produces. For example, if a country can buy something cheaper from another country instead of making it itself, it should just buy it. When a country focuses on making something that costs more to produce than what it can buy, it loses value.

When a country is forced to make something that it could get cheaper from abroad, it means that its workers are not doing the best job they could. Instead of making more valuable things, they are stuck making less valuable ones. This means that the overall value of what the country produces goes down, even if the law wanted to help increase it.

Sometimes, rules can help a country start making a product faster than it could on its own. Eventually, they might even make it for a lower price than other countries. But just because they can make something sooner doesn’t mean the country will be richer overall. The country can only grow if it saves money from what it earns. However, these rules often end up reducing how much money the country makes right away, which doesn’t help it grow faster.

Even if a country doesn’t get to make a certain product because of these rules, it doesn’t mean it will be poorer. The country could still use its resources in a better way, focusing on what works best for them at that time. This means it could still earn the most money possible and grow its wealth quickly.

Some countries have such big advantages in making certain products that it's clear it's pointless to try to compete with them.
