When people invest their money, they usually prefer to put it in places where they can get quick returns. They like to support jobs that create a lot of work in their own country or where they live, and they avoid jobs that create less work. They generally want to invest in opportunities that are the most beneficial for their country and stay away from those that are not.

However, if a job that is usually far away starts to offer better profits than the closer jobs, people will shift their investments. This will continue until the profits of all jobs level out. This situation shows that the faraway jobs might not have enough investment compared to others, meaning that resources in society aren’t being used in the best way. It suggests that some things are either being sold for too much or bought for too little, causing some people to either pay more or receive less than they should.

Even though the same amount of money can’t support as many jobs in a faraway place as it can in a nearby one, those distant jobs can still be important for society. The products from those jobs might be necessary for many nearby jobs. But if the profits from those distant jobs are too high, it means those products will cost more than they should. This will put a strain on people working in nearby jobs because they’ll have to pay more. 

In this case, it would be better for some money to be taken from the nearby jobs and invested in the distant ones to bring the profits down to a normal level and lower the prices of those products. Sometimes, the public good requires that money be moved from jobs that usually do better to those that don’t, and in these situations, what’s best for people aligns with what’s best for everyone. This leads them to take money from the closer jobs and invest it in the farther ones.
