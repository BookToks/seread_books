Adam Smith says that countries without trade and factories usually have to spend a lot of their basic goods to buy a little bit of manufactured stuff from other countries. One country sends out what little it can produce, while the other country sends out a lot of goods and only takes a few things back. The people in the first country end up having way more food and resources than they can grow themselves. In contrast, the people in the second country have much less.

Even though this system has its problems, it’s probably the best explanation we have about how economies work. It’s worth looking into for anyone who wants to understand this important topic better. While it might be too focused on farming as the only way to create value, it does a good job of saying that a country’s wealth isn’t just about having money, but about the useful stuff produced each year by everyone working together. It also argues that true freedom is the best way to make sure this production is as high as possible.

Many people support these ideas, and since people like to discuss unusual opinions, the idea that manufacturing work isn’t productive has attracted a lot of fans. This group has become quite popular in France, known as the Economists. Their writings have helped their country by bringing attention to topics that hadn’t been looked at closely before and by influencing the government to support farming more. Because of their efforts, farming in France has been relieved from some heavy restrictions it used to face. For example, the time a lease can last has been extended from nine to twenty-seven years. Old rules that stopped the movement of grain between regions have been removed, and now it’s legal to export grain to other countries in most cases.
