The Wealth of Nations

For a long time, not many people cared about philosophy and rhetoric, so the first teachers of these subjects had to move around from city to city to find work. This is how teachers like Zeno, Protagoras, Gorgias, and Hippias lived. As more people became interested, schools for philosophy and rhetoric started to settle down, first in Athens and then in other cities. 

The government didn’t really support these schools much. They sometimes gave teachers a specific place to teach, but that was about it. For example, Plato got the Academy, Aristotle got the Lyceum, and Zeno got the Portico. Epicurus gave his gardens to his school. Up until the time of Marcus Antoninus, teachers didn’t get paid by the government; they only earned money from their students' fees. The help that Marcus Antoninus gave to a philosophy teacher probably only lasted while he was alive. 

There were no special privileges for graduating from these schools, and you didn’t need to attend them to work in any job. If people didn’t see the value in these schools, they weren’t forced to go, and there were no rewards for attending. Teachers didn’t have any power over their students, except for the respect that comes from being good at what they do. 

In Rome, studying civil law was part of education, but only for certain families, not most citizens. Young people who wanted to learn about the law didn’t have public schools to attend. Instead, they learned by hanging out with relatives and friends who knew about it. It’s interesting to note that while some laws in Rome were based on older Greek laws, law never really became a proper subject of study in ancient Greece. In Rome, however, it became a real science early on and made those who understood it well-respected. 

In ancient Greece, especially in Athens, the courts were made up of a lot of people, which often led to chaotic and random decisions based on who was the loudest or had the most supporters. The shame of an unfair decision was spread out among hundreds or even thousands of people, since some courts had many members.
