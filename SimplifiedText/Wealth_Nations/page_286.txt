Adam Smith

People often regret borrowing or lending money for silly reasons. When it comes to borrowing or lending, it usually doesn't benefit anyone unless it's a really good deal. Sometimes people do lend or borrow money, but most of the time, people are careful about their money. If you ask a wealthy person who they lend to more, those who will use it wisely or those who will waste it, they would probably laugh at the question. Even among borrowers, the number of careful and hardworking people is much higher than those who are wasteful and lazy.

The only people who usually borrow money without needing to use it wisely are country gentlemen who take out loans against their property. Even they rarely borrow just to waste money. They often have already spent a lot on credit from shops and need to borrow money to pay off that debt. The money they borrow is used to pay back what they owe to shopkeepers, not just to spend freely.

Most loans are given in money, whether it's cash or paper money. But what the borrower really wants is not just the money itself, but the things they can buy with it. If they need it for immediate use, they want actual goods. If they need it to start a business, they need tools and materials to get their work done. When someone borrows money, it's like the lender is giving them a share of the countryâ€™s resources to use however they want.

So, the amount of money that can be lent out in any country isn't just based on the money itself, whether it's cash or paper. It's actually based on the value of what the country produces each year. This includes everything that comes from the land or the work of people, which is meant not just to replace what was borrowed, but also to help the borrower without them having to work too hard.
