The Wealth of Nations

The minister was a hardworking person who knew a lot about managing money and keeping things organized. He had a lot of experience checking public accounts and was good at making sure everything was in order. However, he believed in a strict system that controlled how businesses worked, which was more suited for someone who was used to running public offices. 

He tried to manage the economy like he managed a government office. Instead of letting everyone follow their own interests freely, he gave special advantages to some industries while putting heavy restrictions on others. He favored city businesses over those in the countryside and even tried to hold back rural industries to help city ones. To make food cheaper for city residents and boost manufacturing and trade, he banned the export of grain. This meant that country farmers couldn't sell their crops in foreign markets, which was a big deal for them.

This ban, along with old laws that made it hard to move grain between regions and unfair taxes on farmers, really hurt agriculture in France. The farming industry struggled to grow as much as it could have in such fertile land and a nice climate. This problem was felt all over the country, and many people started looking into why it was happening. One reason seemed to be that Mr. Colbert's policies favored city industries too much over rural ones.

There's a saying that if you bend a stick too much one way, you have to bend it back the other way to make it straight. Some French thinkers believed that agriculture was the main source of a country's wealth. They noticed that in Mr. Colbert's plan, city industries were given too much importance compared to rural ones, and in their own ideas, they seemed to undervalue agriculture.
