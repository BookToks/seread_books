Adam Smith talked about how trading money between England and Holland worked. He explained that if England took less Dutch money and Holland took more English money, it would change how much gold and silver needed to be sent to each country. This would make it harder for England because they would have to send more gold and silver to Holland.

Some of his points were good, while others were misleading. It was true that sending gold and silver out of the country could help it sometimes. It was also true that you couldn’t stop people from sending gold and silver if they thought it was a good idea. But it was misleading to think that keeping more gold and silver was more important than keeping other useful things, which trade usually takes care of on its own. 

They also wrongly believed that if the exchange rate was high, it meant the trade balance was worse and that more gold and silver would leave the country. A high exchange rate actually hurt merchants because they had to pay more for money they needed in other countries. Even if there were extra costs from trying to stop money from leaving, it wouldn’t mean more money would actually go out. Most of that extra cost would just be spent trying to sneak money out, and it wouldn’t lead to sending out more than what was needed.

Merchants would try to balance what they sent out with what they brought in to keep costs down. A high exchange rate would also act like a tax, making foreign goods more expensive and causing people to buy less of them. This would actually help reduce the trade imbalance and the need to send out gold and silver.

Despite the confusing arguments, many people believed them. Merchants talked to parliaments, princes, nobles, and country gentlemen, who didn’t really understand trade. They all saw that foreign trade helped the country, but they didn’t fully understand how it worked.
