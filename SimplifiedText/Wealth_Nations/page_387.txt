The Wealth of Nations

When you keep money in the bank, you often get a receipt for it. This receipt usually doesn’t have much value in the market. For example, three guilders (a type of money) usually sell for three guilders and three stivers, which is the full value if you take the money out of the bank. But before you can take it out, you have to pay a small fee, which feels like a loss for the person holding the receipt. If the bank's fees drop to three percent, those receipts might sell for a little more, like one and three-fourths percent. Right now, the bank's fees are about five percent, so many people let their receipts expire, or "fall to the bank." 

Receipts for gold ducats (another type of money) expire even more often because they have a higher storage fee of half a percent before you can take them out again. The five percent the bank makes when deposits fall to it can be seen as the cost for keeping those deposits safe forever. 

The amount of bank money that has expired receipts must be pretty big. It likely includes all the original money the bank has kept since it was first deposited. People usually don’t care to renew their receipts or take their money out because both options can lead to losing money. Even though this amount is large, it’s thought to be a small part of all the bank money. The Amsterdam bank has been a major storage place for gold in Europe for many years, and receipts for that gold rarely expire. Most of the bank money comes from deposits that people keep adding and taking out.

You can only ask the bank for money using a receipt. The smaller amount of bank money with expired receipts gets mixed up with the larger amount that still has active receipts. So, even if there’s a lot of bank money without receipts, there’s no specific amount that anyone can ask for at any time. The bank can’t owe two people for the same thing, and if you have bank money without a receipt, you can’t ask the bank for your money until you buy a receipt. Usually, it’s not hard to find one to buy at the market price, which matches what you can sell the money or gold for that the receipt lets you take out of the bank.
