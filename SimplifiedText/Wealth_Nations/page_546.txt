Adam Smith

If people in a country are really good at making things, they might not be able to sell them for cheap right away. But if they find buyers at home, they can sell their stuff for prices similar to those from faraway places. As they get better at making things, they will be able to sell them for even less. This means that the people making things in other countries will soon have competition and might even lose their customers.

As the products from this country get cheaper because of improvements, they will start selling not just at home but also in other countries. Over time, they will push out some of the manufacturers from those other countries too.

Eventually, as this country keeps making more and more goods, it will create more money than it can use for farming or making things. The extra money will then be used for trading with other countries, selling what they make that is more than what they need at home. The merchants from this country will have an advantage because they can find what they need locally, while merchants from other countries have to look far away for supplies. Even if their skills in shipping arenâ€™t the best, they can still sell their goods for a good price. If they get as good as the other merchants, they will be able to sell for even less. This means they will start competing with those other countries in trade and eventually push them out.

So, the best way for a country to grow its own makers and sellers is to let everyone trade freely. This helps increase the value of what they produce, and over time, it creates the money needed to support all the makers and sellers they need.
