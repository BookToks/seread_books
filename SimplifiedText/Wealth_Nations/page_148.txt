Adam Smith talks about how having a lot of stuff in a city can actually make it less special. For example, fancy plates and decorations can be bought with less effort when there's a lot of everything. This is the only good thing that comes from having too much.

But things are different when it comes to land. The value of land and what it produces depends on how much it can actually grow, not just how it compares to other land. If a piece of land can grow food, clothes, and houses, it can always support a certain number of people. No matter how much the landlord gets, they will still have some control over the work those people do and what they can trade for. Even the least productive land doesn’t lose value just because it’s near really good land. In fact, it can actually gain value because the people supported by the fertile land will buy things from the less productive land.

When land becomes better at growing food, it not only makes that land more valuable but also helps other lands by creating a need for their products. When there’s a lot of food available because of improved land, it leads to a demand for valuable things like gold, jewels, and nice clothes and furniture. Food is a big part of what makes the world rich, and having a lot of it makes other things more valuable too.

When the Spanish first found Cuba and St. Domingo, the local people wore small pieces of gold as jewelry. They thought of it like pretty little stones and didn’t see it as something super valuable. They would give it away easily to the Spanish visitors without thinking it was a big deal. The Spaniards were shocked by how much the locals didn’t care about the gold. The locals couldn’t understand that there were places where people had so much food that they would trade a lot for shiny things, while they themselves had very little food. If they had understood this, they would have realized how much more valuable their gold was to others.
