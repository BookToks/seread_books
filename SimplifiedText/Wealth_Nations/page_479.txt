The Wealth of Nations

The colonies didn’t really give much money to their mother country. They rarely accepted being controlled by the main city. They were usually allies in wars, but not often subjects during peace.

The European colonies in America never provided military help to protect their mother country. The military strength was never enough for their own safety, and during various wars, protecting the colonies often distracted the military from their main duties. Because of this, all European colonies ended up being more of a burden than a help to their mother countries.

Only the colonies of Spain and Portugal helped financially with the costs of defending their mother country or supporting its government. The taxes collected from other European colonies, especially from England, were usually not enough to cover the expenses during peacetime and definitely not enough during wartime. So, these colonies were more of a cost than a source of income for their mother countries.

The benefits of these colonies to their mother countries mainly come from the special advantages that are thought to come from having such unique places like the European colonies in America. The exclusive trade is recognized as the main way these advantages happen. Because of this exclusive trade, the extra products from English colonies, like certain goods, can only be sent to England. Other countries have to buy them from England later. This means they are usually cheaper in England than anywhere else, which helps England more than other countries.

This also boosts England’s economy. When England trades its surplus products for those special goods, it gets a better deal than other countries would. For example, England can buy more sugar and tobacco from its own colonies than other countries can buy from them. So, when England and other countries trade for sugar and tobacco from the English colonies, England gets a better price, which helps its economy more than it helps others. The exclusive trade of the colonies, therefore, reduces competition for England.
