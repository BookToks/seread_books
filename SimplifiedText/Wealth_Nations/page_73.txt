In tough years, when people get sick or die, it makes it harder for everyone to work and produce things. 

When times are good and there’s plenty of food, workers often leave their jobs and try to make a living on their own. But because food is cheaper, employers, especially farmers, can afford to hire more workers. Farmers think they can make more money by hiring extra help instead of selling their crops for low prices. So, more people want jobs, but there are fewer workers available. This means that during good years, the pay for workers often goes up.

In bad years, when food is hard to find, people are desperate to go back to working for someone else. But since food prices are high, employers have less money to pay workers, so they usually hire fewer people. During tough times, many independent workers end up using up their savings and have to take lower-paying jobs just to get by. This creates a lot of competition for jobs, and many people are willing to accept lower pay than usual. As a result, wages for both workers and those in lower-paying jobs often drop during hard years.

Employers tend to get better deals with their workers during tough times and find them more willing to accept less pay. They often think that hard times are better for business. Landlords and farmers, who are two of the biggest groups of employers, also benefit from high food prices because their income depends on it. 

However, it doesn’t make sense to think that people work less when they’re working for themselves compared to when they work for someone else. A poor independent worker usually works harder than a worker who gets paid by the piece. The independent worker keeps all the money they make, while the other worker has to share it with their boss. Plus, independent workers are less likely to get into trouble with bad influences, which can happen in big factories. 

Overall, independent workers are often better than those who are hired for a set time and get paid the same no matter how much they work. Good years usually lead to more independent workers compared to those in lower-paying jobs, while bad years tend to reduce that number.
