If someone wants to pay less interest, they might raise their profit to cover a tax. This tax would eventually be paid by either the landlords or the consumers, depending on how they use their money. 

If they use their money for farming, they can only increase their profit by keeping more of the crops. This would mean lowering the rent they pay, so the landlord would end up paying the tax. 

If they use their money for selling goods or making things, they can raise their profit by increasing the prices of those goods. In this case, the consumers would end up paying the tax. 

If they don’t raise their profit, they would have to cover the tax from the money they pay as interest. This means they could offer less interest on borrowed money, and the tax burden would fall on the interest itself. So, if they can’t avoid the tax one way, they have to find another way to deal with it. 

At first, it seems like interest on money can be taxed just like land rent. Interest is what’s left after covering all the risks and work involved in using the money. Just like a tax on land rent doesn’t increase rent, a tax on money interest wouldn’t raise interest rates either, because the total amount of money stays the same after the tax. 

The usual profit rate depends on how much money is available compared to how much work needs to be done with it. A tax on money interest wouldn’t change how much work needs to be done, so the amount of money to be used wouldn’t change either. This means the usual profit rate would stay the same. 

The part of the profit that covers the risks and work would also stay the same because those factors don’t change. So, the portion that goes to the owner of the money, which pays the interest, would also remain the same. Therefore, it seems like interest on money could be taxed directly, just like land rent.
