America doesn't pay any taxes on land right now, so it could easily handle a land tax. Most of the land in America and the West Indies isn't rented out to farmers, so it can't be taxed based on rent. But back in Great Britain, they also didn't tax land based on rent back in the 4th year of William and Mary; they used a rough estimate instead. The land in America could be taxed the same way or based on a fair value from a proper survey, like the one done recently in places like Milan and Austria.

Stamp taxes could be collected the same way in all countries where the legal processes and property transfer documents are similar.

If Great Britain expanded its trade laws to Ireland and its colonies, and also allowed more freedom in trade, it would be really beneficial for both sides. All the annoying restrictions that currently hurt Ireland's trade would disappear. The countries north of Cape Finisterre would be open to all kinds of American products, just like the southern countries are now. This would make trade across the British Empire as easy as trading along the coast of Great Britain. It would create a huge market for all the different products from its provinces. This bigger market would quickly make up for any losses Ireland and the colonies might face from higher customs duties.

The excise tax is the only part of Britain's tax system that might need to change depending on where it's applied in the empire. It could be used in Ireland without any changes since its products and consumption are just like Great Britain's. However, for America and the West Indies, where the products and consumption are really different, some adjustments might be needed, similar to how it's done for cider and beer in England.

For example, there's a drink called beer made from molasses in America, which is quite different from the beer we know, but it's a popular drink among the people there.
