The Wealth of Nations

The bank in this country had a good idea, but they didn’t really think things through. They wanted to help people, but they didn’t fully understand the problems they were trying to fix. This bank was more generous than any other before it, giving out cash accounts and loans without much thought. They treated all types of bills the same, whether they were real or just in circulation.

The bank’s main goal was to lend money for projects that take a long time to pay off, like improving land. They believed that helping with these projects was really important. Because they were so generous with cash accounts and loans, they printed a lot of bank notes. However, most of these notes were more than what people could easily use, so they quickly came back to the bank to be exchanged for gold and silver. This meant the bank didn’t have much money in its vaults.

The bank had raised a total of one hundred sixty thousand pounds, but only eighty percent of that was actually paid in. People were supposed to pay in parts over time. Many of the owners opened cash accounts when they made their first payment, and the bank allowed them to borrow against their accounts for their future payments. This just meant they were moving money around without really adding to it.

Even if the bank had more money, it would have lost it quickly because it was giving out too many loans. When the bills came due, they would have to borrow more money from London to pay them off, which was a bad idea. The bank started having money problems just a few months after it opened. The owners had valuable estates worth millions, and their investments were supposed to back the bank’s promises. Because of this, the bank was able to keep running for over two years despite its mistakes. When it finally had to shut down, it had about two hundred thousand pounds in bank notes still in circulation. To keep those notes going, they kept coming back to the bank quickly.
