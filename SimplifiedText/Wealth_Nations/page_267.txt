The Wealth of Nations

In the colony, people used gold and silver coins before they started using paper money. At first, the colony decided that 5 shillings in British money would be worth 6 shillings and 3 pence in their money, and later it changed to 6 shillings and 8 pence. So, one pound in the colony's money was worth about 30% less than one pound in British money. Even when they switched to paper money, it was still usually about 30% less valuable. They raised the value of their coins to stop gold and silver from leaving the colony, thinking that if they made the coins worth more, people wouldn’t want to send them away. But when they did this, the prices of goods from Britain went up just as much, so gold and silver kept leaving the colony anyway.

The paper money in each colony was accepted for paying taxes, which gave it some extra value. This value depended on how much paper money was made compared to how much was needed for taxes. In most colonies, there was way more paper money than needed for taxes.

If a ruler decided that part of the taxes should be paid with a specific type of paper money, that could give that paper money some value, even if it was up to the ruler when it could be exchanged for something else. If the bank that issued the paper money made sure to keep the amount low, people would want it more, and it could even sell for more than the same amount in gold or silver. Some people explain this by looking at the bank of Amsterdam, where their bank money is worth more than regular money, even though you can’t just take it out whenever you want. Many foreign payments have to be made with bank money, which means transferring it in the bank's records. The bank directors try to keep the amount of bank money lower than what people need, which is why it sells for a higher price, usually about four or five percent more than the same amount in gold or silver.
