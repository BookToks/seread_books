Adam Smith

When taxes are lower, people get to keep more of what they earn. This extra money can be saved and used to create even more jobs. The English colonists haven't really helped pay for the protection of their home country or its government. Instead, the home country has mostly paid to defend the colonists. The cost of armies and ships is way higher than what it costs to run a government. 

The cost of running their own government has always been pretty low. It usually just covers paying the governor, judges, and some police officers, plus keeping a few important public projects going. For example, before things got tense, Massachusetts Bay spent about £18,000 a year on its government. New Hampshire and Rhode Island spent £3,500 each, Connecticut spent £4,000, New York and Pennsylvania spent £4,500 each, New Jersey spent £1,200, and Virginia and South Carolina spent £8,000 each. 

Nova Scotia and Georgia get some money from the government each year, but Nova Scotia also pays about £7,000 a year for its public expenses, while Georgia pays about £2,500. Overall, before the current issues started, the total cost for running the governments in North America, not counting Maryland and North Carolina, was about £64,700 a year. This shows how a large group of people can be governed well without spending a lot of money. 

Most of the costs for defense and protection have always been covered by the home country. The ceremonies for welcoming a new governor or starting a new assembly are nice but not overly fancy or expensive. Their church government is also run on a budget. They don’t have tithes, and their clergy, who are not many, are paid by small salaries or donations from the people. 

In contrast, Spain and Portugal get some money from taxes on their colonies. France doesn’t really make much money from its colonies because the taxes they collect are usually spent there. However, the way these countries run their colonies is more complicated and costly. For example, a lot of money is spent to welcome a new viceroy in Peru.
