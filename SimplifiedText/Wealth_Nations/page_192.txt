If the price of land goes up, more land will be used for farming. This has happened in most of England, where a lot of good land is used for this purpose. But in Scotland, especially away from big towns, farmers don’t use much good land to grow food for cows just for dairy products. Even though prices have gone up a lot in recent years, they might still be too low for farmers to make a profit. The quality of dairy products in Scotland isn’t as good as in England, and this lower quality might be because the prices are low, not the other way around. Even if the quality was better, farmers might not be able to sell it for a higher price right now. The current prices probably wouldn’t cover the costs of land and labor needed to produce better quality products. 

In England, even with better prices, dairy farming isn’t seen as more profitable than growing crops or raising cattle, which are the main focuses of farming. So, in Scotland, it’s not even that profitable yet. 

No country can fully improve its land until the prices of all the products grown on it are high enough to cover the costs of improving and farming the land. To do this, the price of each product needs to be enough to pay for good farmland rent and also cover the farmer’s expenses and labor, just like it does for good crop land. This increase in prices must happen before land can be improved for farming. Making a profit is the goal of all improvements, and nothing can really be called an improvement if it leads to losses. If improving land for a product doesn’t bring back the costs, then it’s not worth it. If fully improving and cultivating the land is the best thing for everyone, then rising prices for different products should be seen as a good thing, not a bad one.
