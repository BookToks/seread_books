A guinea can be thought of as a ticket for getting certain things you need from local shops. The real value of this guinea isn’t just the gold itself, but what you can trade it for. If you couldn’t trade it for anything, it would be as useless as a piece of paper from someone who has no money.

When people in a country get paid, they usually receive money, but their true wealth depends on how much stuff they can buy with that money. The total wealth of everyone isn’t just the money they have or the things they can buy, but it’s more about the things they can actually purchase.

We often talk about someone’s income in terms of the money they get each year. This is because the amount of money they have shows how much they can buy. But really, their income is about what they can buy, not just the cash itself. 

This idea is even clearer when we look at a whole society. The money that one person gets each year can be equal to their income, so it’s an easy way to show its value. However, the total amount of money in a society can’t match the total income of everyone. For example, the same guinea can pay one person’s pension today and someone else’s tomorrow. So, the total money in a country is always less than the total income paid out. But the ability to buy things with that money is equal to the income people receive. Therefore, income isn’t just about the cash itself, but about the things people can buy with it as it changes hands.

Money is like the engine that keeps everything moving in trade. While it’s an important part of business, it’s not the only thing that matters.
