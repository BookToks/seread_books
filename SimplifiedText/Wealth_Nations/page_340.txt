Adam Smith says that wars and government changes can easily mess up the money that comes from trade. But the money that comes from farming is much more stable and can only be ruined by long-lasting attacks from violent countries, like what happened before and after the Roman Empire fell in Western Europe.

Political economy is a part of what leaders and lawmakers study. It has two main goals: first, to help people have enough money or food for themselves, and second, to make sure the government has enough money for public services. It aims to make both the people and the government richer.

Different times and places have led to two main ways of thinking about how to make people wealthy. One way focuses on trade, and the other focuses on farming. I will explain both of these ideas clearly, starting with the trade system. This is the modern way of thinking and is easiest to understand in our country today.
