The government, like any other owner of money or resources, can make money from it in two ways: by using it themselves or by lending it out. When they use it, they make a profit, and when they lend it, they earn interest.

For example, a Tartar or Arabian chief makes money mainly from the milk and growth of their own animals, which they take care of themselves. In the simplest form of government, profit is the main way a king or ruler makes money for the state.

Small republics sometimes make a good amount of money from business projects. For instance, the city of Hamburg is known to earn money from running a public wine cellar and a pharmacy. It’s interesting to note that a government shouldn’t be so small that its leader has time to run a wine shop or a pharmacy. Larger states have made money from public banks, like Hamburg, Venice, and Amsterdam. Some people even think that a big country like Great Britain should pay attention to this kind of income.

If we look at the Bank of England, it usually gives a profit of about 5.5% on its money, which totals around ten million seven hundred eighty thousand pounds. After covering management costs, the bank supposedly makes about five hundred ninety-two thousand nine hundred pounds a year. The government could borrow this money at a lower interest rate and, if they managed the bank themselves, they could earn around two hundred sixty-nine thousand five hundred pounds a year.

Countries like Venice and Amsterdam have been good at managing these kinds of business projects because they are careful and organized. However, it’s unclear if England, which isn’t known for being very good with money, could do the same. In peaceful times, England tends to spend money carelessly, and during wars, they often act without thinking things through.
