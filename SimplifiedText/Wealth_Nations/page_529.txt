The Wealth of Nations

You can't make good cloth without wool. If England could stop all wool from being exported, it could control almost all of the wool trade in the world. This would mean they could sell it for any price they wanted and get super rich because of it. A lot of people believe this idea, especially those who don’t know much about the wool trade or haven’t looked into it closely. But this idea is completely wrong. English wool isn’t needed to make fine cloth; in fact, it’s not good for that at all. Fine cloth is made from Spanish wool. Mixing English wool with Spanish wool would ruin the quality of the cloth.

Earlier in this work, it was shown that rules about wool have lowered the price of English wool way below what it should be today, and even lower than it was back in the time of Edward III. After Scotland joined England, the price of Scottish wool dropped by about half. An expert named Reverend Mr. John Smith pointed out that the best English wool in England usually costs less than low-quality wool in Amsterdam. The goal of these rules was to keep the price of wool low, and they definitely worked.

Some might think that lowering the price of wool would discourage farmers from growing it, which could lead to less wool being produced. While it might not have dropped below past levels, it likely is lower than it could have been if prices were allowed to rise naturally. However, I think the total amount of wool produced hasn’t changed much, even if it might have been slightly affected by these rules. Sheep farmers mainly make money from selling the meat, not just the wool. So, even if the price of wool is low, they can still earn money from selling the sheep themselves.
