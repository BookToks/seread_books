The Wealth of Nations

People have written a lot about the money system in France and how it has problems. But it seems like the issues aren't really because of the taxes themselves. Instead, they come from the confusing way the laws are written.

When it comes to registering mortgages and property rights, it’s really helpful for both lenders and buyers. But registering other types of documents can be annoying and even risky for people, without helping anyone else. Any registers that should be kept secret shouldn’t exist at all. People shouldn’t have to rely on the honesty of lower-level tax workers for their credit. However, when the fees for registering documents become a way for the government to make money, there are usually way too many offices set up for both the important documents and the unimportant ones. In France, there are many secret registers. While this might not be a necessary problem, it’s a common result of such taxes.

In England, stamp duties on things like cards, dice, newspapers, and magazines are basically taxes on what people buy. The people who end up paying these taxes are the ones who actually use these items. There are also stamp duties on licenses for selling alcohol, which are meant to tax the sellers but are ultimately paid by the customers who buy the drinks. Even though these taxes are called the same thing and collected in similar ways, they are actually very different and affect different types of money.

Now, about taxes on workers' wages. I’ve explained before that the pay for lower-class workers is influenced by two main things: how much work is available and the average price of food. When there’s more demand for workers, or if the population is growing, it affects how much money workers can earn. The average cost of food also decides how much money workers need to make to afford a decent amount of food each year.
