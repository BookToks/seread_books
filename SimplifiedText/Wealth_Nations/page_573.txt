The fall of Carthage and the rise of Rome is the second big event. The ups and downs of these two famous cities can be explained by the same reason. 

From the end of the first Carthaginian war to the start of the second, Carthage's armies were always fighting under three great leaders: Amilcar, his son-in-law Asdrubal, and his son Annibal. They first dealt with their own rebellious slaves, then fought against the nations in Africa, and finally conquered the big kingdom of Spain. Annibal’s army, which he led from Spain into Italy, became very disciplined like a professional army through these battles. 

Meanwhile, the Romans were not completely at peace, but they weren’t involved in any really big wars during this time. Their military training got a lot weaker. The Roman armies that Annibal faced at Trebi, Thrasymenus, and Cannae were made up of regular citizens, not a trained army. This difference likely played a big role in the outcomes of those battles. 

The professional army that Annibal left in Spain was stronger than the Roman militia sent to fight it. Soon, under his brother, the younger Asdrubal, they pushed the Romans almost entirely out of Spain. However, Annibal didn’t get enough supplies from home. The Roman militia, always fighting, became a well-trained army over time, making Annibal’s advantage smaller and smaller. 

Asdrubal thought he needed to take most of his army from Spain to help his brother in Italy. During this journey, he got lost and was surprised by another strong army, leading to his defeat. After Asdrubal left Spain, Scipio found only a weaker militia to fight against. He defeated them, and his own militia became a trained army too. 

This army was later sent to Africa, where they faced only a militia. To protect Carthage, they had to bring back Annibal’s trained army. The discouraged and often defeated African militia joined him, and at the battle of Zama, they made up most of Annibal’s troops. What happened that day decided the fate of both cities.
