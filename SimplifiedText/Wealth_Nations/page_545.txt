The Wealth of Nations

The best way to help everyone in society is to support three main groups: merchants, skilled workers, and manufacturers. In places like Holland and Hamburg, these groups mainly rely on landowners and farmers for their work and income. The problem is that many of these landowners and farmers live far away from the merchants and workers they supply.

These trading countries are really important for people in other countries. They help fill a gap by providing the merchants and workers that those other countries should have but don’t, usually because of poor government choices.

It’s not in the best interest of landowning countries to make it hard for trading nations by charging high taxes on their goods. These taxes would just make things more expensive and lower the value of the extra products from their land. This would discourage farmers from producing more and improving their land. Instead, the best way to increase the value of their extra products and encourage more farming would be to let trading nations operate freely.

Allowing free trade would help these countries get the skilled workers and manufacturers they need. It would also fill the gaps they have in their own industries in the best way possible. 

As the extra products from their land keep increasing, they would eventually create more money than they could use just for farming. This extra money would naturally go towards hiring skilled workers and manufacturers at home. These local workers would have access to materials and resources right away, allowing them to work more cheaply than those in trading countries who have to import everything from far away.
