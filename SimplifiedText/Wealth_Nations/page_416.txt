Adam Smith says that the government spends a lot of money on fishing. For example, they give £113:15s. just for bounties, and each barrel of herring costs £159:7:6.

First, the way they fish in Scotland, using bigger boats called busses, is not really the best for the area. This method was borrowed from Holland, which is far from the seas where herrings are found. Holland needs bigger boats because they have to travel far, but in Scotland, especially in places like the Hebrides and Shetland, there are lots of smaller sea-lochs where herrings come to spawn. These sea-lochs make it easier for smaller boats to fish because they can quickly bring the fish to shore to be sold or eaten fresh. 

However, the government gives a big reward (30s. per ton) for using the bigger busses, which makes it harder for the smaller boat fishers to compete. Because they don’t get any rewards, the smaller boat fishers can’t sell their fish as cheaply as the bigger boats. As a result, the smaller boat fishery, which used to be really important and employed many fishermen, has almost disappeared. I can’t say exactly how much it has declined because there was no record kept of it.

Also, in many parts of Scotland, herrings are a big part of what people eat during certain times of the year. If the government helped lower the price of herrings in local markets, it could really help a lot of people who don’t have much money. But the bounty for the bigger busses doesn’t help with that. Instead, it has hurt the smaller boat fishery, which is better for local markets. Plus, the extra reward for exporting herring means that most of the fish caught by the busses is sold outside of Scotland, not helping local people at all.
