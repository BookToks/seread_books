Adam Smith talks about how the government borrowed money and managed its debts. At first, creditors, or people who lent money, agreed to accept a lower interest rate of five percent. This helped save one percent on most of the government’s debts. Because of this saving, there was extra money left over from taxes that went into what is called the sinking fund. In 1717, this fund had over £523,000. By 1727, the interest on most public debts was lowered to four percent, and later to three and a half and three percent, which added even more to the sinking fund.

A sinking fund is important because it helps pay off old debts and makes it easier to take on new ones. It’s like having a backup fund ready to help out when the government needs money. We’ll see later how often the sinking fund in Great Britain was used for these purposes.

Besides the main ways of borrowing money, there are two other methods that are kind of in between. These involve borrowing money based on annuities for a set number of years or for a person's lifetime. During the times of King William and Queen Anne, the government often borrowed large amounts using these methods. For example, in 1695, they borrowed one million pounds with a fourteen percent annuity for sixteen years. In 1691, they tried to borrow a million pounds based on lifetime annuities, but not enough people signed up. The next year, they managed to borrow money again using lifetime annuities at a similar rate. 

In 1695, people who bought these annuities could swap them for longer ones of ninety-six years by paying a fee. This was because the government was seen as unstable, so not many people wanted to invest even with these offers. During Queen Anne's reign, money was borrowed in various ways, including through lifetime annuities.
