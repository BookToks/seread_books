When we buy gold directly from Portugal, we get it cheaper than if we buy it from other countries, except Spain. But this price difference isn’t really a big deal. 

Most of our gold comes from Portugal. With other countries, we either spend more than we earn or just break even. We should keep in mind that the more gold we get from one country, the less we can get from others. Every country has a limit on how much gold it can use. If we get most of our gold from one place, there’s only a little left for everyone else. Also, if we bring in a lot of gold from certain countries, we have to send some gold out to others. So, if it looks like we’re doing well in trade with some countries, it probably means we’re not doing as well with others.

People thought England couldn’t survive without trading with Portugal. So, near the end of the last war, France and Spain told the king of Portugal to stop British ships from coming to his ports. They even suggested sending their soldiers to help enforce this. If the king had agreed to these embarrassing terms from Spain, England would have been better off without having to support such a weak ally who couldn’t defend himself. Even if we lost the Portugal trade, it would have mostly just upset the merchants who were making money from it. They might have struggled for a year or two to find other good ways to invest their money, but that would have been the worst of it for England.

The main reason we import gold and silver isn’t for making jewelry or coins, but for trading with other countries. Using these metals for trade is often better than using other goods. They are accepted everywhere, making it easier to trade for different items. Plus, because they are small and valuable, it’s cheaper to move them around.
