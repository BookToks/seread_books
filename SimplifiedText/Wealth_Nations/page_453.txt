The Wealth of Nations

Nature has only a little bit of gold and silver in certain places, and it’s surrounded by tough materials that make it hard to get to. Because of this, it takes a lot of work and money to dig them out. People thought they could find big amounts of these metals in many places, just like they found lead, copper, tin, or iron. Sir Walter Raleigh had a dream about a city full of gold called El Dorado, showing that even smart people can have wild ideas. Even over a hundred years after he died, a Jesuit named Gumila still believed in El Dorado and was excited about the idea of spreading his faith to a people who could reward him well.

In the places first discovered by the Spanish, there are no gold or silver mines that are worth working on today. The amounts of these metals that the first explorers claimed to find were probably exaggerated, just like the richness of the mines they worked on right after they were discovered. However, what they reported finding got many more Spaniards eager to go to America. Every Spaniard who sailed there hoped to find their own El Dorado. Luck was on their side in some ways, as they found a lot of gold and silver when they conquered Mexico and Peru, about thirty and forty years after Columbus's first trip.

The first discovery of the West was actually because of a plan to trade with the East Indies. The Spanish set up their colonies in the new lands because they wanted to find gold and silver mines. A series of unexpected events made their quest for riches much more successful than they had any reason to believe it would be.

Other European adventurers who tried to settle in America had similar dreams of finding wealth, but they weren’t as lucky. It took over a hundred years after the first settlement in Brazil before any gold, silver, or diamond mines were found there. In the English, French, Dutch, and Danish colonies, there were no such discoveries either.
