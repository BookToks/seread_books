The Wealth of Nations

Even though the prices of gold and silver can change a lot, if the price stays pretty much the same for several years, it means something about the coins is affecting their value. This means that the coins might be worth more or less than what they should be based on the gold or silver they contain. If the price stays steady, it suggests that the reasons behind it are also steady.

The money in a country is a good way to measure value, depending on how closely the coins match the standard they should meet. For example, if in England, 44 and a half guineas had exactly one pound of standard gold, then those coins would be a reliable way to measure how much things are worth. But if those coins get worn down and contain less gold, then their value becomes uncertain, just like other weights and measures can be.

Since it's rare for weights and measures to be exactly right, merchants have to set prices based on what they find out through experience, not just what the weights and measures should be. Because of the same issues with coins, prices of goods are adjusted based on how much gold or silver the coins actually have, rather than what they are supposed to have.

When I talk about the money price of goods, I mean the amount of pure gold or silver they can be sold for, regardless of what the coins are called. For example, six shillings and eight pence from the time of Edward I is considered the same money price as a pound today because they both contained about the same amount of pure silver.
