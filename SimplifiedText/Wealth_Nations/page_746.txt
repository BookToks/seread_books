The French tax system is not as good as the British one. In Great Britain, they collect about ten million pounds from less than eight million people, and it’s hard to say that any specific group is being treated unfairly. 

In France, there are around twenty-three to twenty-four million people, which is about three times more than in Great Britain. France has better land and weather, and it has been improving for a longer time. Because of this, France has more big cities and nice houses, both in towns and in the countryside. With these benefits, it seems like France could easily collect thirty million pounds in taxes to support the government, just like Britain collects ten million without much trouble. 

But in 1765 and 1766, France only managed to collect between 308 and 325 million livres, which is less than fifteen million pounds. That’s not even half of what they could have collected if their people paid taxes like those in Great Britain. People in France generally feel like they are paying a lot more in taxes than those in Britain. Still, France has a pretty fair government compared to other countries in Europe, right after Great Britain.

When all the reasonable tax options are used up, if the government still needs more money, they have to start taxing things that shouldn’t really be taxed. The taxes on basic goods...
