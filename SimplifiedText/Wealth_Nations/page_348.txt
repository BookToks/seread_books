Adam Smith

Sometimes, when people need money, they can't find any. They ask everyone to lend them some, but no one has any to give. This doesn't always mean that there’s a shortage of gold and silver coins. It often means that many people want those coins but don’t have anything to trade for them. 

When businesses are making more money than usual, they often make the mistake of buying too much. Both big and small sellers do this. They might not send more money out of the country than before, but they buy a lot of goods on credit, hoping to sell them quickly and get paid before they have to pay back what they owe. But often, the payment is due before they get their money back, and they end up with nothing to buy more money or to use as security for loans. So, it’s not really a lack of gold and silver that causes complaints about money; it’s just that people can’t borrow it easily, and their lenders can’t get paid back.

It would be silly to argue that wealth is just about having money or gold and silver. Wealth is really about what you can buy with money, and money is only valuable because it helps you buy things. Money is part of a country’s wealth, but it’s usually a small and not very useful part.

Merchants find it easier to buy goods with money than to buy money with goods. This is because money is the main tool for trading, and people are willing to exchange a lot for it. But it’s not always easy to get money in exchange for goods. Most goods can spoil faster than money, so keeping them can lead to bigger losses. When merchants have goods, they might face demands for money that they can’t meet, unlike when they have cash in hand. Merchants usually make more profit from selling than from buying, so they often want to trade their goods for money rather than the other way around.

Even if a merchant has a lot of goods, they can sometimes go bankrupt if they can’t sell them in time. However, a whole country doesn’t face the same risk. A merchant’s wealth is often tied up in goods meant to buy money. But only a small part of what a country produces each year is meant to buy gold and silver from other countries. Most of it is used and shared among the people in that country.
