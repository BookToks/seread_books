The Wealth of Nations

Back in the day, a teacher could charge a lot for their lectures—like a thousand minae, which is about £3,335. Plutarch mentioned that this was a common price for teaching. Many famous teachers from that time made a lot of money. For example, Georgias even gave a solid gold statue of himself to the temple of Delphi. It’s probably safe to say it wasn’t life-sized. 

Plato described the lifestyles of teachers like Hippias and Protagoras as really fancy, almost showy. Plato himself lived pretty lavishly too. Aristotle, who taught Alexander the Great and got really well-paid for it, still thought it was worth going back to Athens to teach again. Back then, there weren’t as many teachers as there would be later, so they were more respected and could charge more for their work. Even though Athens wasn’t as powerful as it used to be, they still sent famous teachers like Carneades and Diogenes on important missions to Rome.

Carneades was actually from Babylon, and since the Athenians were picky about letting foreigners into public jobs, it shows how much they valued him. 

This difference in how teachers are treated might actually help the public more than it hurts. Sure, it might make teaching seem less important, but having cheaper education is definitely a good thing. People could benefit even more if schools and colleges were set up in a better way than they are now in most of Europe.

Also, Europe’s rules make it hard for workers and resources to move freely between jobs and places. This can create unfair differences in the benefits and downsides of different jobs. For example, apprenticeship laws make it tough for workers to switch jobs, even if they’re in the same area. Plus, special privileges for certain groups can stop workers from moving to different places, even if they’re doing the same job. 

Sometimes, you’ll find that while some jobs pay really well, others don’t, and that can be a problem.
