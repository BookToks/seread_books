When manufacturing grows really big, making the tools for trade becomes a big deal too. If we encourage bringing in these tools from other places, it can hurt our own manufacturers. Because of this, bringing in some tools has often been banned. For example, bringing in wool cards was banned unless they came from Ireland or were found as wreckage. This ban started a long time ago and has been kept going by later laws.

Sometimes, bringing in materials for manufacturing has been encouraged by not charging taxes like other goods. For instance, importing sheep wool from certain countries, cotton wool from anywhere, and some other materials has been allowed without taxes if done correctly at the customs office. Merchants and manufacturers might have pushed for these tax breaks, but they make sense. If these breaks could be given to more materials, it would benefit everyone.

However, some manufacturers have pushed these tax breaks too far. For example, a small tax of 1 penny per pound was placed on foreign brown linen yarn, which was much lower than the previous taxes. But the manufacturers wanted more, so later, the tax on brown linen yarn was completely removed. Preparing linen yarn takes a lot of work, even more than making linen cloth from that yarn.
