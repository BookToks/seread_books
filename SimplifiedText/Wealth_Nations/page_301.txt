The Wealth of Nations

When someone trades British products for sugar and rum from Jamaica, they have to wait for the returns from that trade. If different merchants are involved, where one buys from another and then sells again, each merchant gets their money back faster. But overall, the whole process still takes a long time. It doesn’t matter if one merchant or three are involved; the country’s trade situation stays the same. 

To trade British goods for flax and hemp, you need to use three times more money if you go through multiple merchants instead of trading directly. This complicated way of trading usually doesn’t help the country’s workers as much as a simpler trade would. 

No matter what foreign goods are bought, whether it’s with gold from Brazil or silver from Peru, it doesn’t change the nature of the trade or how much it helps the workers in the country. These metals were also bought with something that was produced by the country’s workers or something else that was. So, when it comes to supporting local jobs, trading with gold and silver is just as slow or fast as any other complicated trade. 

However, trading with gold and silver has one advantage: it’s cheaper to move them around because they are small and valuable. The shipping costs are lower, and they don’t get damaged easily. So, you can often buy more foreign goods using less of what the country produces when you use gold and silver instead of other goods.
