The Wealth of Nations

When money is borrowed by the government, it can lead to problems for the land and businesses in the long run. People who lend money to the government care about the overall success of farming, factories, and trade in the country. They want the land to be in good shape and the businesses to be well-managed. If these areas do poorly, the taxes collected might not be enough to pay back what is owed to them.

However, a lender doesn’t really care about any specific piece of land or business. They don’t know much about them, and they don’t keep an eye on them. If something goes wrong with a particular piece of land or business, they might not even find out, and it won’t directly affect them.

Over time, borrowing money has weakened many countries that have done it. The Italian city-states were among the first to start this practice. Genoa and Venice, the only two that still exist independently, have both become weaker because of it. Spain learned this from Italy and has become even weaker because its taxes aren’t as smart. Spain has had debts for a long time, being in debt since before the 1600s, which was about a hundred years before England borrowed any money. France, despite its resources, is also struggling under heavy debts. The United Provinces are just as weakened by their debts as Genoa or Venice.

Is it really possible that Great Britain, which has seen this weaken other countries, will be fine? Some might argue that the tax system in those countries isn’t as good as England’s, and I think that’s true. But remember, even the best governments will run out of good ways to collect taxes and may have to resort to bad ones in tough times. The smart government of Holland has sometimes had to use taxes that are just as annoying as many of Spain’s. 

If another expensive war starts before the government has fixed its money problems, Britain’s tax system could become just as burdensome as Holland’s or Spain’s. So far, Britain’s tax system hasn’t caused too many issues for businesses, even during tough times.
