The Wealth of Nations

Making wool and yarn used to be really hard work. Before machines were invented, it took a lot of time and effort just to get everything ready to weave. Also, thickening cloth used to mean stomping on it in water, which was a hassle. Back in the early 1500s, there were no wind or water mills in England or most of Europe, but they had been used in Italy for a while. 

Because of all this, it makes sense that the prices for both cheap and fancy cloth were way higher back then than they are now. It took a lot more work to get those goods to market, so they had to sell for more money. 

In ancient England, making cheap cloth was probably done at home, with everyone in the family helping out when they had free time. It wasn't their main job, so it was cheaper to sell. On the other hand, fancy cloth was made in Flanders, a wealthy area, where people relied on it for their main income. This fancy cloth was also imported, so it had to pay some taxes to the king, but those taxes weren't very high back then. 

Europe wanted to encourage importing foreign goods, so merchants could provide rich people with the luxuries they wanted that local workers couldn't make. All these reasons help explain why, back in the day, cheap cloth was much cheaper compared to fancy cloth than it is today.
