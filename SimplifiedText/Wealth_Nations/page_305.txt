The Wealth of Nations

Foreign trade is about how much extra stuff a country can produce and what that stuff can buy. The trade that involves moving goods around the world can be really huge compared to other types of trade and can use a lot of money.

People usually think about their own profit when deciding how to use their money, whether it’s in farming, making things, or selling stuff. They don’t really think about how much work it creates or how it helps society. In places where farming makes the most money, people will invest in it because it benefits everyone. But in Europe, farming doesn’t seem to make more money than other jobs.

Recently, many people have talked about how much money can be made from farming and improving land. But if we look closely, we see that many people have made huge fortunes from trade and manufacturing, often starting with very little money. There hasn’t been a single case in Europe this century where someone got rich from farming in the same way.

There’s still a lot of good land in Europe that isn’t being used, and even the land that is used isn’t being improved as much as it could be. This means that farming could actually use a lot more money than what has been invested in it so far.

I will explain why businesses in cities have an advantage over farming in the countryside, making it more profitable for people to invest in trade with faraway places like Asia and America instead of improving their own local farms in the next two books.
