The second reason for respect is age. Older people, as long as they aren’t too old to think clearly, are usually respected more than younger people who have the same rank, wealth, and skills. In hunter societies, like some Native American tribes, age is the main way to show rank. In these groups, you call an older man "father" to show respect, a man your age "brother" as an equal, and a younger man "son" to show he’s below you. Even in rich and developed societies, age still matters when people are otherwise equal. The oldest sibling usually gets the most respect, and when it comes to family inheritance, things that can’t be split, like titles, usually go to the oldest child. Age is clear and easy to understand, so there’s no argument about it.

The third reason is wealth. Money has a lot of power, especially in societies where there are big differences in wealth. For example, a Tartar chief who has a lot of livestock can support a thousand men, and he has to use that wealth to take care of them. In his simple society, he doesn’t have fancy goods to trade, so he has to provide for these men. They rely on him for everything, so they must follow his orders in battle and peace. His wealth makes him both their leader and their judge. 

In a rich and developed society, a person can have a lot of money but not control many people. Even if someone has enough wealth to support a thousand people, those people pay for what they get, so they don’t feel completely dependent on him. His power is limited to a few servants. Still, money is very powerful, even in a rich society. People often complain that wealth has more influence than age or personal qualities. In the earliest societies, like those of hunters, there isn’t much inequality because everyone is poor, which creates a sense of equality. In those societies, age or wealth doesn’t really create a hierarchy.
