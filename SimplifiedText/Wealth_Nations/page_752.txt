People save their money and hide it because they don't trust the government. They worry that if others knew they had money saved up, it would be taken from them. Because of this, not many people would want to lend money to the government when it really needs it. The government realizes it has to save money itself because it can't rely on borrowing. This makes it even more determined to save.

Right now, many big countries in Europe have huge debts that are getting worse and could lead to their downfall. Just like regular people, countries usually start borrowing money based on their reputation, without promising to pay it back from any specific source. When that doesn't work, they start borrowing against specific funds.

In Great Britain, the "unfunded debt" is borrowed in the first way. Some of it doesn't earn interest, similar to how a person might borrow money without a clear plan to pay it back. Other parts do earn interest, like a person borrowing against a loan or a promise to pay back. Debts can come from special services or things that weren't paid for right away, like military expenses or wages for sailors. 

The government sometimes uses navy and exchequer bills to manage these debts. Exchequer bills earn interest right away, while navy bills earn interest after six months. The Bank of England helps keep the value of these bills up by agreeing to accept them at their full value and paying the interest due. This helps the government borrow a lot of money. In France, without a bank, state bills have sometimes lost a lot of value. During a major coin change in King William's time, exchequer bills and tallies were sold at a big discount because people were worried about the new government after the Revolution.
