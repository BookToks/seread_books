The Wealth of Nations

Just like it was necessary to lower the tax on gold to one-twentieth, the silver mines in Spanish America are getting more expensive to work. This is because they have to dig deeper, which means it costs more to pump out water and bring in fresh air. Everyone who has looked into these mines knows this.

These reasons make silver harder to find and more expensive to get. When something is harder to collect, it becomes scarcer. Over time, this will lead to one of three things: First, the higher costs could be covered by raising the price of silver. Second, the tax on silver could be lowered enough to balance it out. Third, a mix of both could happen. This third option is very likely. Just like gold prices went up even with a lower tax, silver prices might also go up compared to labor and other goods, even if the tax on silver is lowered too.

Lowering the tax might not stop the value of silver from rising completely, but it will definitely slow it down. Because of these tax cuts, more mines can operate now since they can afford the lower tax. This means more silver will be available each year, making the value of silver a bit less than it would have been otherwise. After the tax was reduced in 1736, the value of silver in Europe might not be lower than it was before, but it’s probably at least ten percent lower than it would have been if Spain had kept the old tax.

Even with this tax cut, the value of silver has started to rise a little in Europe this century. Based on what I’ve mentioned, I think it might be happening, but I’m not completely sure. The rise has been so small that many people might doubt it, and they might even wonder if the value of silver is still falling instead.
