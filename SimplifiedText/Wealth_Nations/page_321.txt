In the past, people had to pay a yearly poll tax. This tax was usually given in exchange for protection, meaning that the tax might help cover what the wealthy people lost by not paying other taxes. At first, these taxes and exemptions were personal, affecting only specific individuals during their lives or as long as their protectors wanted.

Old records from the Doomsday Book show that certain towns in England had specific taxes that some townspeople paid to the king or a lord for protection. Sometimes, these records only mentioned the total amount of taxes collected. 

Even though the townspeople might have started off in a tough situation, they gained freedom and independence much earlier than the farmers in the countryside. The money from these poll taxes in a town was usually rented out for a set number of years, either to the county sheriff or to other people. The townspeople often got enough trust to manage the taxes from their own town, taking responsibility for the total rent.

This way of renting was common across Europe, where kings would let entire estates to the tenants, who would then be responsible for the rent. In return, they could collect the rent however they wanted and pay it to the king’s treasury through their own bailiff, which helped them avoid the rude behavior of the king’s officials. This was really important back then.

At first, the town's taxes were probably rented to the townspeople for a limited time. Over time, it became normal to give them the rights to the taxes forever, with a fixed rent that wouldn’t increase. Since the payments were now permanent, the exemptions they received in return also became permanent. These exemptions stopped being personal and were tied to the townspeople as a group, which is why their town was called a free burgh, just like they were known as free burghers or free traders.
