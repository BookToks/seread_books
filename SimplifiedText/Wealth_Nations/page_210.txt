I’ll wrap up this long chapter by saying that when society gets better, it usually makes the rent for land go up. This means the landlord gets richer and can buy more stuff, including the work or products from other people.

When farming and land use improve, the landlord gets a bigger share of what’s produced. As the amount of goods increases, so does the landlord’s cut.

For example, when the price of cattle goes up because of better farming, the rent for land also goes up, and even more than before. The landlord’s share of the total goods increases, but it doesn’t take more work to gather those goods. This means that a smaller amount of what’s produced can still give the landlord a good profit, so he ends up with a bigger piece of the pie.

Improvements that make labor more efficient can lower the price of manufactured goods, but they also help raise the rent for land. The landlord can trade his extra produce for manufactured items. If those manufactured goods get cheaper, the landlord’s produce becomes more valuable. This means he can buy more nice things for himself.

Whenever society gets richer and more people are working, it helps increase the rent for land. More workers and animals are used to farm, which means more goods are produced, and that leads to higher rent.

On the flip side, if farming is ignored, or if the prices of goods from the land drop, or if manufactured goods become more expensive because of less production, then the overall wealth of society goes down. This will lower the rent for land.
