The Wealth of Nations  
CHAPTER III  

About the Extra Restrictions on Importing Goods  

There are many strict rules about bringing in goods from countries that are seen as a disadvantage to trade. These rules are meant to help increase the amount of gold and silver a country has. For example, in Great Britain, you can import Silesia lawns by paying certain taxes, but you can't bring in French cambrics and lawns unless they go to London first to be stored for export.  

The taxes on French wines are higher than those on wines from Portugal or other countries. Back in 1692, a tax of 25% was put on all French goods, while most goods from other countries had much lower taxes, usually not more than 5%. French wine, brandy, salt, and vinegar had even heavier taxes because of other laws. In 1696, another 25% tax was added to French goods, except for brandy, along with new taxes on French wine and vinegar.  

French goods have always been included in the general taxes that apply to most goods. If we look at all the different taxes, we can see that before the current war started, the lowest tax on most French goods was about 75%. For many goods, these taxes are so high that it feels like a ban. The French have also treated British goods and products harshly, but I don't know all the details about their specific rules.
