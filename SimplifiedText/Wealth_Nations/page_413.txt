The Wealth of Nations talks about how the price of silver can change over time. It’s not the silver itself that changes, but its value compared to money.

When the government gives money to help sell homemade goods to other countries, there are some problems. First, it can force businesses to do things that aren’t as good for them. Second, it can push them into a situation that actually loses money. For example, if they need a bonus to sell corn, that trade is probably not going to make money.

When landowners asked for this bonus, they were copying merchants and manufacturers. But they didn’t fully understand what was best for them. They made the public pay a lot of money in taxes, but they didn’t really increase the value of their corn. This also made silver worth a bit less, which hurt the overall economy and slowed down improvements on their land.

To really boost the production of something, it would make more sense to give a bonus for making it rather than for selling it. This way, there would only be one tax for the bonus. Instead of raising prices, it could lower them, which might help people get some of their money back. However, bonuses for production are rarely given out. People believe that a country gets richer mainly by selling things to other countries rather than making them. Because of this belief, selling has been favored as a quicker way to bring money in. Some say that bonuses for production are more likely to be cheated than those for selling, but it’s known that selling bonuses have also been misused.
