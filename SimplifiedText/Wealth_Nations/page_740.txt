First, taxes on certain goods can make life really annoying for the people selling those goods. They have to deal with tax collectors who check on them a lot, which can feel like a hassle and sometimes even unfair. Even though being annoyed isn’t exactly a cost, it’s like a price people would pay to avoid that annoyance. 

Excise taxes, which are taxes on goods made within the country, can be more bothersome than customs taxes, which are on imported goods. Once a merchant pays customs duties and stores their goods, they usually don’t have to deal with customs officers again. But with excise taxes, sellers have to deal with excise officers constantly checking on them. Because of this, excise taxes are less popular, and so are the officers who collect them. 

These officers might be doing their jobs well, but because they have to check on people so often, they can come off as rude or harsh, unlike customs officers. However, this could just be what dishonest sellers say when they get caught trying to cheat the system.

Even though taxes on goods can be annoying, people in Great Britain deal with them about as well as people in other countries with similar government costs. Our system isn’t perfect, but it’s as good, if not better, than many of our neighbors.

In some places, taxes on goods have been charged every time those goods are sold. This idea came from thinking that taxes on goods were really taxes on the profits of sellers. So, it seemed fair to tax everyone who sold the goods, not just the first seller. For example, Spain had a tax called alcavala, which started at ten percent, then went up to fourteen percent, and is now six percent on every sale of property, whether it’s something you can move or not. This tax gets charged every time the property is sold. 

To collect this tax, a lot of tax officers are needed to make sure goods are tracked properly, not just between provinces, but even from one store to another.
