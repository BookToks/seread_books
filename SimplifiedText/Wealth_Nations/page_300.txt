Adam Smith talks about how trade works between Britain and other countries. When British goods are sent to places like Portugal, and then Portuguese goods come back, only one British capital is replaced. This means that the money used in this trade doesn't help British industry as much as trading within Britain does.

When you trade within Britain, the money comes back quickly, often before the year ends, and sometimes even several times a year. But when trading with other countries, it usually takes longer to see the returns, often not until the end of the year or even after a couple of years. Because of this, money used in local trade can support British industry way more than money used in foreign trade.

Sometimes, foreign goods bought for home use are paid for with other foreign goods. But those foreign goods must have been bought with something from Britain, either directly or through other trades. So, in the end, the money used in this complicated foreign trade has the same effects as money used in simpler trade, but it takes longer to see any returns. For example, if hemp and flax from Riga are bought with tobacco from Virginia, which was purchased with British goods, the merchant has to wait for the returns from two different trades before they can buy more British goods.
