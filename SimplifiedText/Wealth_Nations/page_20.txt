Adam Smith talks about how people help each other by trading what they make. Everyone has different skills, and when they share what they create, it becomes easier for everyone to get what they need.

The way work is divided among people depends on how big the market is. If the market is small, people won’t want to focus on just one job because they can’t trade their extra work for what they need from others. 

Some jobs can only happen in big cities. For example, a porter, who carries things, can only find work in a large town. A small village is too small for him to earn a living. In tiny villages, farmers have to do everything themselves, like butchering animals, baking bread, and brewing beer for their families. In these places, it’s hard to even find a blacksmith.
