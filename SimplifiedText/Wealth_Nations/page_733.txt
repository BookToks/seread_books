The Wealth of Nations talks about taxes on alcohol. Right now, the tax on strong drinks is about 3 shillings and 10 pence for every gallon. Even though the tax on strong alcohol is only 2 shillings and 6 pence per gallon, when you add in the tax on the lower-quality alcohol used to make it, the total comes to 3 shillings and 10 pence. They measure both types of alcohol to stop people from cheating the system.

If the government raises taxes on malt (which is used to make beer) and lowers the taxes on distilling alcohol, it could make it harder for people to smuggle alcohol. This could help the government earn more money.

For a while now, Great Britain has been trying to reduce how much alcohol people drink because they think it can harm health and lead to bad behavior. Because of this, they shouldn’t lower the taxes on distilling alcohol too much, so the prices don’t drop. Strong alcohol could stay expensive, while beer and ale could get cheaper. This way, people would feel less burdened by high prices, and the government could still make good money.

Dr. Davenant has some concerns about changing the current tax system. He thinks that if the tax is only on malt, it would hurt the maltsters (the people who make malt) more than the brewers and retailers. He worries that maltsters wouldn’t be able to raise prices as easily as brewers and retailers, and that high taxes on malt could lower the profits for barley farmers.

However, no tax can keep profits down for too long in any business. Profits usually balance out with other nearby businesses. The current taxes on malt, beer, and ale don’t hurt the profits of those selling them because they can raise prices and still make money. A tax might make things more expensive, which could lower how much people buy. But since malt is mainly used for making drinks, a tax of eighteen shillings on malt wouldn’t make drinks more expensive than the current taxes, which are around twenty-four or twenty-five shillings. In fact, drinks might even get cheaper, and people would likely buy more of them.
