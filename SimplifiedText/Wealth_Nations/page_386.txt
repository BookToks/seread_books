Adam Smith

Sometimes, a person might leave their gold in the bank for six months without taking it out. They might forget to pay a small fee to get a new receipt for another six months. This doesn’t happen often, but it happens more with gold than with silver because gold costs more to store.

When someone deposits gold, they get a bank credit and a receipt. They use the bank credit to pay their bills and can either sell or keep the receipt, depending on whether they think gold prices will go up or down. The receipt and bank credit usually don’t stay together for long, and they don’t need to. If someone has a receipt and wants to get gold, there are always enough bank credits available to buy it at the regular price. Likewise, if someone has bank money and wants gold, there are always receipts available.

People with bank credits and those with receipts are two different types of customers of the bank. If you have a receipt, you can’t get the gold without giving the bank an amount of bank money equal to what the gold costs. If you don’t have bank money, you need to buy some from someone who does. On the other hand, if you have bank money, you can’t get gold without showing the bank the receipts for how much you want. If you don’t have any receipts, you have to buy them from someone else. 

When someone with a receipt buys bank money, they are paying for the chance to take out gold that costs five percent more than the bank price. So, the five percent they pay is for something real, not just made up. If someone with bank money buys a receipt, they are paying for the chance to take out gold that usually costs two to three percent more than the mint price. So, the price they pay is also for something real. The costs of the receipt and the bank money together make up the total value of the gold.

The bank also gives receipts and bank credits for regular coins, but those receipts often aren’t worth much and won’t sell for a good price. For example, if someone deposits ducatoons, which are worth three guilders and three stivers, the bank only gives a credit of three guilders, which is five percent less than their actual value. They also give a receipt that lets the person take out the ducatoons they deposited within six months, but they have to pay a small fee.
