Adam Smith talks about how countries can get rich and what happens when they reach a certain point. When a country has as many workers as it can support, there’s a lot of competition for jobs. This means wages, or how much workers get paid, will be really low, just enough for people to survive. If a country has enough businesses for its workers, then the profits, or how much money businesses make, will also be low because everyone is competing.

But no country has really reached this level of wealth. China seems to have been stuck in one place for a long time and might have all the riches it can have based on its rules and systems. However, these riches might be less than what it could have if it had different laws. A country that ignores trade with other nations and only allows a few foreign ships to dock won't be able to do as much business as it could with better rules.

In places where the rich feel safe but the poor do not, the poor can be taken advantage of by those in power. This means there won’t be as many businesses as there could be. The rich will take control of all the trade, making huge profits while the poor struggle. In China, for example, the usual interest rate for money is around twelve percent, which is high because the profits need to cover this cost.

Sometimes, bad laws can make interest rates go way up, even if the country isn’t that wealthy. If the law doesn’t make sure people keep their promises, it’s like all borrowers are seen as risky, like bankrupts. Because lenders are unsure if they’ll get their money back, they charge high interest rates, just like they would from someone who can’t pay back their debts. In the past, when wild tribes took over parts of the Roman Empire, keeping promises was often ignored for a long time.
