Adam Smith

Banks and bankers usually act in their own best interest. They have even done a bit more than that. They sometimes traded too much, which caused them to lose money or at least make less profit. This happens whenever they over-trade, even just a little. 

Traders and other business people, who got help from banks, wanted even more support. They thought banks could give them as much credit as they needed without any big costs, just the price of some paper. They complained that the bank directors were too cautious and didn't give enough credit as trade in the country grew. What they really meant was that they wanted to expand their own projects beyond what they could afford with their own money or what they could borrow from regular people through loans or mortgages. 

The traders believed that banks had a duty to give them all the money they needed to keep trading. But the banks disagreed. When the banks refused to give them more credit, some traders tried a different method that worked for a while, even though it was more expensive. This method was called drawing and redrawing, which is something desperate traders do when they are close to going bankrupt. 

This way of raising money had been known in England for a long time. During the last war, when trading profits were high, many traders over-traded, and this method was used a lot. It then moved to Scotland, where it became even more common because the local trade was smaller and the available capital was limited. 

The practice of drawing and redrawing is well-known among business people, so it might seem unnecessary to explain it. But since this book might be read by people who aren't in business, and because even business people might not fully understand how it affects banking, I will try to explain it clearly. 

The trading customs that started when Europe had weak laws about contracts have been adopted into the laws of many European countries over the last two centuries. These customs have given special rights to bills of exchange, making them important in business.
