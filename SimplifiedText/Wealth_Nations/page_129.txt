The Wealth of Nations

When there aren’t any local benefits, the money made from growing crops like corn, which people eat a lot, will naturally affect how much money can be made from raising animals on the same land. 

Using special grasses, turnips, carrots, cabbages, and other methods to make a piece of land feed more animals than just regular grass should lower the price of meat compared to bread in a developed country. It looks like this has happened, and there’s some evidence that in the London market, meat prices are a lot lower compared to bread prices now than they were back in the early 1700s.

In the notes about Prince Henry's life, Doctor Birch shares what Prince Henry usually paid for meat. He mentions that four quarters of an ox, weighing 600 pounds, cost him about nine pounds and ten shillings, which is around thirty-one shillings and eight pence for every hundred pounds. Prince Henry died on November 6, 1612, when he was just 19 years old.

In March 1764, there was a government investigation into why food prices were so high at that time. A merchant from Virginia said that in March 1763, he paid twenty-four or twenty-five shillings for a hundred weight of beef, which he thought was the normal price. But in that expensive year, he had to pay twenty-seven shillings for the same amount. Even though the price in 1764 was high, it was still cheaper than what Prince Henry paid for the best beef.

The price Prince Henry paid comes out to about 3d. 4/5ths for every pound of the whole cow, including both good and not-so-good pieces. At that price, the better pieces would have been sold for at least 4½d. or 5d. per pound.

During the 1764 investigation, witnesses said that the best beef pieces cost consumers about 4d. to 4½d. per pound, while the lower-quality pieces were between seven farthings and 2½d. to 2¾d. They mentioned that this was generally half a penny more than what those pieces usually sold for in March. But even this high price was still much cheaper than what we can guess the regular price was during Prince Henry’s time.

In the first twelve years of the last century, the average price of the best wheat at the Windsor market was £1:18:3½d.
