Adam Smith talks about how money can be a reliable friend. Even though money can change hands a lot, if it stays in the country, it won’t get wasted easily. He believes that gold and silver are the most important parts of a country's wealth. So, he thinks that increasing the amount of these metals should be a main goal for a country’s economy.

Some people think that if a country was completely cut off from the rest of the world, it wouldn’t matter how much money it had. They say that what really matters is how many goods are available to buy. The wealth or poverty of a country depends on how many useful things it has. But they believe that things are different for countries that trade with others or have to fight wars. These countries need to send money abroad to pay for their armies and fleets. A country can’t send out a lot of money unless it has a lot at home. So, during peaceful times, these nations should try to gather gold and silver to be ready for any future wars.

Because of these ideas, many European countries have tried hard to collect gold and silver, but with little success. Spain and Portugal, which have the main mines for these metals, have made strict rules against exporting them, with heavy penalties for breaking these rules. Other European countries also had similar rules in the past. Even Scotland had laws that banned taking gold and silver out of the country, with serious punishments for those who did.

When countries became more focused on trade, merchants found these rules really annoying. They often wanted to use gold and silver to buy foreign goods because it was easier than using other items. They argued that sending gold and silver out to buy goods didn’t always mean there would be less of it in the country. In fact, it could sometimes lead to having more gold and silver.
