Adam Smith talks about how universities started teaching original languages to help explain important ideas. This was needed for understanding the changes brought by the Reformation. Greek was a big part of classical learning, which was popular around the same time as the Reformation. So, most universities taught Greek before students studied philosophy, especially after they learned some Latin. 

Hebrew, on the other hand, wasnâ€™t connected to classical learning and was mostly used in the Holy Scriptures. Because of this, students usually started learning Hebrew after they began studying philosophy and theology. In the past, universities taught the basics of Greek and Latin, and some still do. In other places, students are expected to know at least the basics of one or both languages before starting their studies, as these languages are important in university education.

Ancient Greek philosophy was split into three main areas: physics (natural philosophy), ethics (moral philosophy), and logic. This division makes sense based on how things are.

People have always been curious about nature, like the movements of stars, eclipses, and strange weather. These wonders make us want to know why they happen. At first, people thought these events were caused by gods. Later, philosophy tried to explain them using more familiar reasons. Since these natural wonders sparked curiosity, the science that aims to explain them was likely the first part of philosophy that people studied. The earliest philosophers we know about were natural philosophers.

Throughout history, people have paid attention to each other's actions and intentions, creating rules for how to live together. Once writing became common, wise people started recording these ideas.
