The competition among different sellers makes them all agree on a certain price, but they don’t have to sell for less than that price. The amount of stuff sold in stores usually matches how much people actually want to buy. It’s important for everyone who uses their land, work, or money to sell things that the amount they sell doesn’t go over what people want. It’s also important for everyone else that they don’t sell less than what people want.

If they sell too much, some parts of the price will drop below what they should normally be. For example, if the price is too low for rent, landlords will want to take some of their land off the market. If it’s about wages or profits, workers or their bosses will pull back some of their work or resources. Soon, the amount sold will match what people actually want, and prices will go back to normal.

On the other hand, if not enough is sold, some parts of the price will go up higher than usual. If it’s rent, other landlords will want to make more land available for that product. If it’s wages or profits, workers and sellers will quickly try to use more labor and resources to make and sell more. Eventually, the amount sold will be enough to meet what people want, and prices will drop back to normal.

The natural price is like the average price that all products are trying to reach. Sometimes, prices can go way above or below this average because of different situations. But no matter what happens, prices are always trying to settle back to this average.

The total amount of work done each year to sell a product usually matches what people want to buy. It aims to bring just the right amount to meet that demand, not more.

However, in some jobs, the same amount of work can produce very different amounts of products from year to year. In other jobs, it might produce about the same amount every time. For example, the same number of farmers can grow very different amounts of crops like corn or wine in different years.
