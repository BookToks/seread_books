The Wealth of Nations

People started moving their money from old businesses to new, more profitable ones. Because of this, there was less competition in those old trades. This meant that there were fewer different types of goods available in the market. As a result, prices went up, and those selling these goods made more money. They could then afford to borrow money at higher interest rates. For a while after the last war, even trustworthy individuals and big companies in London were borrowing money at five percent interest, while before they usually paid only four or four and a half percent. The big increase in land and trade from our gains in North America and the West Indies explains this change. It doesn't mean that the overall money supply in the country went down. With so much new business to handle, there was less money available for many specific areas, leading to less competition and higher profits.

If the overall money supply in the country decreases, it lowers workers' wages but raises profits for those who still have money to invest. When wages are low, the people with money can sell their goods for less, making it cheaper for them to bring products to market. Since there is less money being used to supply the market, they can charge more for their goods. This means their profits go up on both ends, allowing them to pay higher interest rates. The huge amounts of money made quickly in places like Bengal and other British settlements in the East Indies show that while wages are low, profits are really high in those struggling areas. The interest rates on loans are also very high. In Bengal, farmers often borrow money at rates of forty, fifty, or even sixty percent, using their next crop as collateral. Since these high-interest loans take away most of the landlord's rent, they also eat into the profits of those borrowing the money. A similar situation happened before the fall of the Roman Republic, where high-interest loans were common in the provinces due to poor management. The honorable Brutus even lent money in Cyprus at a crazy rate of forty-eight percent, as noted in Cicero's letters.

In a country that has gained a lot of wealth because of its land, climate, and location...
