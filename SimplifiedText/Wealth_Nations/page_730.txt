Adam Smith

It's important to remember that taxes should be on luxuries, not on the basic needs of lower-income people. If you tax their necessary expenses, the burden will end up on wealthier people instead. This kind of tax would either make wages go up or reduce the need for workers. If wages go up, the wealthy will end up paying for it. If the demand for workers goes down, it would hurt the overall production of the country, which is what taxes are based on. No matter what happens, this type of tax will always lead to higher wages, and again, the wealthy will end up paying for it.

In Great Britain, people can make their own alcohol at home without paying taxes. This rule is meant to keep tax collectors from bothering families. Because of this, wealthy families often pay less in taxes compared to poorer ones. While not many people distill alcohol at home, many middle-class and wealthy families brew their own beer. This means their beer costs them about eight shillings less per barrel than what a regular brewer would charge, who has to include the tax in their price. So, these families can drink their beer for nine or ten shillings less than what regular people pay for the same quality, since it's easier for regular folks to buy beer a little at a time from a brewery or pub.

When families make malt for their own use, they also don’t have to deal with tax collectors, but they still have to pay a tax of seven shillings and sixpence per person. This amount is equal to the tax on ten bushels of malt, which is about what a typical family would use. However, in wealthy families where they often entertain guests, the amount of malt liquor they drink is just a small part of what they consume. Because of this tax or for other reasons, it’s more common for people to brew beer at home than to make malt. It’s hard to see why people who brew or distill at home shouldn’t have to pay the same kind of tax.
