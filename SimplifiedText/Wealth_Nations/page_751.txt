The Wealth of Nations

People who run businesses often handle a lot of money, not just their own, but also money from others who lend to them or trust them with goods. This money can change hands many times in a year. In contrast, a regular person who doesn't have a business usually only gets their income once a year. 

In a country with many merchants and manufacturers, there are always people who can lend a lot of money to the government if they want to. This is because businesses can make money quickly, so they have the cash available to lend.

However, for businesses to do well, the country needs to have a fair legal system. People need to feel safe about owning their property, and contracts should be respected by law. If people don’t trust the government to enforce these rules, businesses struggle to succeed. When merchants and manufacturers trust the government, they are more likely to lend their money to it.

When businesses lend money to the government, it doesn’t hurt their ability to operate; it often helps them grow. The government usually needs money and is willing to borrow it on good terms. The loans are secure, and people trust that they will get their money back, often for more than they originally lent. So, when merchants lend to the government, they can actually make more money and increase their business funds. They often see it as a good opportunity when they are allowed to invest in new government loans.

The government tends to rely on the willingness of its people to lend money during tough times. Since borrowing is easy, the government might not feel the need to save money itself.

In a less developed society, there aren’t many big businesses or factories. People usually just save whatever money they can.
