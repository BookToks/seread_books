Adam Smith

In some countries, growing certain crops is more profitable than anything else. But this might not last long because of laws that limit how freely people can grow grapes. 

In 1731, the government made a rule that stopped people from planting new vineyards or replanting old ones unless they got special permission from the king. This permission would only be given if a local official checked the land and said it couldn’t grow anything else. They claimed this rule was because there was not enough corn and pasture, but too much wine. 

If there really was too much wine, people wouldn’t want to plant new vineyards because the profits would drop. In places where grapes are grown, like Burgundy and Guienne, corn is actually grown very well. The workers who grow grapes also help with corn farming because they create a market for it. Reducing the number of people who can buy corn doesn’t help farmers; it’s like trying to help farming by hurting factories. 

The profits from crops that need more money and effort to grow can sometimes be higher than those from corn and pasture. But if they only cover the extra costs, they end up being linked to the profits from common crops. Sometimes, there isn’t enough land to meet the demand for a specific crop. In those cases, the whole crop can be sold for a price that covers all the costs of growing and selling it. 

The extra money left after paying all the expenses might not match what’s left from corn or pasture, and it can be much higher. Most of this extra money usually goes to the landlord’s rent.
