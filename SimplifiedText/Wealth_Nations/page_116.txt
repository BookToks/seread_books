Workers in one type of job might be doing really well, while those in another type are just getting by. The first job is growing and always needs more workers, but the second job is shrinking, so there are too many workers for it. Sometimes these jobs are in the same town or area, but they can't help each other out. There are rules that make it hard for workers to switch jobs, and sometimes those rules are really silly.

For example, weaving plain linen and plain silk is almost the same skill. Weaving plain wool is a bit different, but not by much. A linen or silk weaver could learn to weave wool in just a few days. So, if one of these jobs is going downhill, workers could find a job in one of the others that is doing better. This way, their pay wouldn't get too high in the good job or too low in the bad one. The linen job in England is open to everyone, but since it’s not popular in many areas, it doesn’t really help workers from other struggling jobs. When they can’t find work, they often have to rely on the government or take low-skill jobs, which they aren’t really trained for. So, they usually choose to rely on the government.

Anything that makes it hard for workers to move from one job to another also makes it hard for money to move around. The amount of money that can be used in a business depends a lot on how many workers are available for it. However, laws about corporations make it easier for rich merchants to trade in a town than for poor workers to find jobs there.

These laws that make it hard for workers to move around are common in Europe. But in England, there are also laws that make it tough for poor people to find a place to live or work outside their own area. This problem mainly affects skilled workers and manufacturers.
