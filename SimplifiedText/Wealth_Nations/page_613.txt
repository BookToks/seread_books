The Wealth of Nations

In 1769, a ship called the Cruttenden East Indiaman reported that the total money they made, after paying all expenses and military costs, was about two million forty-eight thousand seven hundred and forty-seven pounds. They also had another income, mostly from customs fees at their different locations, which added up to £439,000. Their trade profits were reported to be at least £400,000 a year, with some saying it was even £500,000. This big amount of money could have allowed them to pay an extra £680,000 each year and still have enough left to pay off their debts quickly.

However, by 1773, instead of paying off their debts, they actually owed more money. They had a debt of £400,000 to the treasury, unpaid customs duties, a big loan from the bank, and over twelve hundred thousand pounds from bills they accepted from India. All these debts caused them a lot of stress, forcing them to cut their dividend to six percent and ask the government for help. They requested to stop paying the £400,000 a year and to borrow £1.4 million to avoid going bankrupt.

It seemed that their growing wealth only gave their workers in India a reason to spend more and act irresponsibly. Because of this, the way they were running things in India and Europe was looked into by Parliament. As a result, some important changes were made to how their government worked both at home and in India. In India, their main cities—Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta—were previously independent but were now put under a governor-general and a council of four advisors. Parliament decided who would be the governor and the council, and they were to live in Calcutta, which had become the most important English city in India. The court in Calcutta, which was originally set up to handle business cases in the city, had expanded its power as the empire grew. Now, it was limited back to its original purpose.
