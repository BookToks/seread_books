The Wealth of Nations

Producers should only get attention if it helps consumers. This idea is so obvious that it doesn’t need proof. But in the mercantile system, the needs of consumers are often ignored for the benefit of producers. It focuses more on making things than on what people actually want to buy.

When we stop foreign goods from coming in that compete with local products, it clearly hurts consumers. They end up paying higher prices because of this control. 

Producers also benefit when they get rewards for selling their products overseas. Consumers have to pay the taxes that fund these rewards, plus even higher prices for the goods at home.

For example, a trade deal with Portugal makes it so consumers can’t buy certain products from nearby countries, even if those products are better. Instead, they have to buy from faraway places, which often sell lower-quality stuff. Consumers have to deal with this just so producers can sell their goods abroad at better prices. This also raises prices at home.

In managing our American and West Indian colonies, the interests of consumers have been sacrificed even more for producers. We created a big empire just to make sure there were customers who had to buy from our producers. Because of this monopoly, consumers have had to pay for the costs of maintaining and defending that empire. In the last two wars alone, over two hundred million was spent, and a new debt of more than one hundred seventy million was created just for this reason.
