The Wealth of Nations

When people lend money, it creates what we call "monied interest." This is different from land ownership and businesses because in those cases, the owners use their own money. In the monied interest, money is just a way to transfer funds from one person to another. The amount of money used can be much less than the total value of what is being bought or lent.

For example, if A lends W £1000, W can use that money to buy £1000 worth of goods from B. Since B doesn’t need the money, he can lend it to X, who then buys £1000 worth of goods from C. C can do the same and lend the money to Y, who buys goods from D. In just a few days, the same money can be used for three different loans and purchases, each worth the same as the original amount.

What A, B, and C give to W, X, and Y is the ability to buy things. This ability is what makes the loans valuable. The total value of the goods that can be bought with the loans is three times more than the actual money used. These loans can be secured, meaning the goods bought will eventually bring back the same amount of money, plus some extra profit.

When money is lent with interest, it’s like giving the borrower a part of the yearly earnings, as long as they promise to pay back a little extra each year, called interest, and return the same amount they borrowed at the end. Even though money is used to make these agreements, it is different from what is actually being exchanged.

As the part of the yearly earnings that goes towards paying back the loan increases, it shows how money can be used in different ways to help people buy and sell things.
