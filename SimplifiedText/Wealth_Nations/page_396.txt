Adam Smith talks about how countries trade with each other. Sometimes, countries trade with others that they don't get along with, especially when there’s a lot of anger between them. 

Even though a rich neighbor can be a threat in war, they can also be good for trade. When countries are at peace, a wealthy nation can buy more from us and sell us better stuff. Just like a rich person is likely to spend more money at local shops than a poor person, a rich country is also better for business. 

However, a rich manufacturer can be a tough competitor for local businesses. Still, most people benefit from the good market that the rich create. They even gain from the rich person selling things cheaper than the poorer workers. Rich countries can have strong manufacturers that compete with their neighbors, but this competition helps everyone because it creates a better market for all.

People looking to make money usually move to big cities or commercial areas because they know that where there’s more money flowing, there are more opportunities. The same idea applies to entire nations. A country is more likely to get rich through trade when its neighbors are also wealthy and busy with business. 

A big country surrounded by poor, wandering tribes might get rich by farming and trading within itself, but not through foreign trade. This is how ancient Egyptians and modern Chinese became wealthy. The Egyptians ignored foreign trade, and the Chinese look down on it and barely protect it with laws. The current ideas about foreign trade often aim to make other countries poorer, which can backfire and hurt everyone involved.
