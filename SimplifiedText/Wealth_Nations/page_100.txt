Adam Smith talks about how the same amount of work can produce different amounts of things like corn, wine, and sugar in different years. This means that prices for these things can change a lot, not just because people want them more or less, but also because the amount available changes a lot. Because of this, the profits for some sellers will also go up and down with the prices. Merchants who guess how prices will change try to buy things when they think prices will go up and sell them when they think prices will go down.

Also, the benefits and downsides of different jobs can only be equal if those jobs are the main ones people do. If someone has a job that doesn’t take up most of their time, they might be willing to do another job for less money during their free time.

In Scotland, there are still some people called cottars or cottagers, although there aren’t as many as there used to be. They work for landlords and farmers and usually get a house, a small garden, some grass for a cow, and maybe a little bit of bad farmland. When their boss needs them to work, they also get some oatmeal each week. A lot of the year, their boss doesn’t need them, and their own small garden isn’t enough to keep them busy. 

In the past, there were more cottagers, and they were willing to work for very little money because they had extra time. Back then, they were common all over Europe. In places where farming wasn’t very good, landlords and farmers needed extra help during busy times. The money these workers got wasn’t the only payment for their work; their small homes were also part of what they earned. However, many writers who looked at old prices thought that the money paid for labor was the whole payment, and they liked to say that prices were really low back then.
