The Wealth of Nations

When this bank first started, some people thought that even if it ran out of money quickly, it could easily get more by lending to those who had borrowed from it. But soon, they realized that this way of getting money was way too slow for what they needed. The bank's money was running out fast, and they could only refill it by taking risky loans from London. When those loans were due, they had to pay them back with even more loans, plus extra fees. 

Even if they managed to get money quickly this way, they would still end up losing money instead of making a profit. In the long run, they would have hurt themselves as a business, even if it took longer than if they had used the more expensive method of borrowing and lending. They couldn’t really earn anything from the interest on the money they lent out because it was more than what the country could use. So, they had to keep borrowing money to pay back what they had already lent. 

All the costs of borrowing money, finding people to lend to, and making the right agreements would have been a huge loss for them. It’s like a guy trying to keep a pond full of water while it’s always leaking. He thinks he can do it by sending people to fetch water from a well far away, but it’s not a smart plan. 

Even if this method worked for the bank, it wouldn’t help the country at all. In fact, it would cause a lot of problems. This plan wouldn’t increase the amount of money available to lend; it would just turn the bank into a big loan office for everyone. People who needed to borrow money would have to go to this bank instead of to private lenders. But a bank that lends to hundreds of people it doesn’t really know isn’t likely to pick better borrowers than someone who knows a few people well and trusts them to pay back the money.
