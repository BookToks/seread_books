The Wealth of Nations

The feudal law was meant to control the power of the big landowners, not to make it bigger. It created a system where everyone, from the king to the smallest landowner, had certain responsibilities. When a landowner was too young to manage their land, their rent and land management went to their boss, which usually meant the king. The king was supposed to take care of the young landowner and even arrange their marriage, as long as it was suitable for their status. 

Even though this system gave the king more power and reduced the power of the big landowners, it didn’t really fix the problems in the country. The government was still weak at the top and too strong at the bottom. The strong lower members made the government weak. After feudalism started, the king still couldn’t control the powerful lords. They kept fighting each other and even attacking the king, causing chaos and violence in the countryside.

But while all this fighting was going on, trade and manufacturing from other countries slowly changed things. The big landowners found ways to trade their extra crops for things they wanted, without having to share with anyone else. It seems that throughout history, the powerful have always wanted everything for themselves. Once they figured out how to enjoy the full value of their land without sharing, they didn’t want to give anything to others. They might trade the food that could support a thousand people for something silly, like fancy diamond buckles, just for themselves. In the past, they would have had to share their wealth with many people, but now they could keep it all.
