The Wealth of Nations

Taxes can make things more expensive because they increase the cost of the work that creates them. So, these taxes are like a tax on every product made at home. To make sure local businesses compete fairly with foreign ones, some people think we need to add a tax on foreign products that matches the price increase of local products.

I’ll talk about whether taxes on basic needs, like soap, salt, leather, and candles in Great Britain, raise the cost of labor and other products later. But for now, let’s assume they do raise prices, which they definitely do. This overall price increase is different from a specific product that has a tax directly added to it.

First, we can usually figure out exactly how much a tax will raise the price of a specific product. But with the overall increase in labor costs, it’s hard to know how much it will affect the price of different products. So, it’s tough to set a fair tax on foreign goods based on how much local products have gone up in price.

Second, taxes on basic needs affect people’s lives like having bad soil or weather. It makes food more expensive, just like if it took a lot of effort and money to grow it. Just like it wouldn’t make sense to tell people how to use their resources when facing natural challenges, it doesn’t make sense to do that with taxes creating artificial problems. People should be free to adjust their work to fit their situation and find jobs where they can still do well, even with tough conditions. 

Adding more taxes when people are already struggling with high costs for basic needs and other products is a really silly way to fix things. When taxes get too high, they can be just as bad as having poor land or bad weather. Yet, it’s often in the richest and hardest-working countries that these taxes are the highest.
