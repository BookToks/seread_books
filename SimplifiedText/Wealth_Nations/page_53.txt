The Wealth of Nations

Different types of products, like oil or hops, can be made in varying amounts each year. But when it comes to making linen and woolen cloth, the number of spinners or weavers usually produces about the same amount each year. The average amount produced in this type of work can sometimes be much higher or much lower than usual. Because of this, the total amount of these products available can sometimes be way more than what people want to buy, or sometimes not enough. Even if the demand stays the same, the prices can change a lot, sometimes going way below or above what they normally cost.

In other types of work, the amount produced stays pretty much the same, so it can match what people want to buy more closely. When the demand stays steady, the prices for these products are likely to stay close to their normal prices. People know that the prices of linen and woolen cloth don’t change as much or as often as the prices of corn. The prices of cloth only change based on how much people want it, while corn prices can change a lot more because of how much is available in the market.

When prices do change, it mostly affects the parts of the price that go to wages and profits. The part that goes to rent is less affected. If rent is a set amount of money, it doesn’t change at all because of these price fluctuations. However, if rent is based on a percentage or amount of the product, it can change in value each year based on market price changes, but it usually doesn’t change in rate. When landlords and farmers agree on rent, they try to set it based on average prices, not the temporary highs and lows.

These price changes can affect how much wages or profits are worth, depending on whether there are too many or too few products or workers available. For example, during a time of public mourning, the price of black cloth goes up because there isn’t much of it available, which helps the merchants who have it. But this doesn’t change the wages of the weavers who make the cloth.
