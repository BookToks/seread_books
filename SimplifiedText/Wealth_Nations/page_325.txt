The Wealth of Nations

When people feel safe about keeping what they earn, they work harder to improve their lives and get not just what they need, but also nice things. This kind of work started in cities long before it became common for farmers in the countryside. If a poor farmer managed to save a little money, he would hide it from his master, who would take it if he found out. The farmer would try to escape to a city, where the law was more forgiving. If he could stay hidden in the city for a year, he would be free forever. So, any money or goods that hardworking people in the countryside saved often ended up in cities, which were the only safe places for them.

People living in cities do rely on the countryside for food and materials, but those in cities near the coast or big rivers can get supplies from far away. They can trade their own products or act as middlemen, exchanging goods between distant places. This way, a city can become very rich and fancy, even if the nearby countryside and other places it trades with are poor. Individually, those places might not provide much, but together, they can support the city well. However, there were some wealthy and hardworking countries back then, like the Greek empire and the Saracens during the Abbasid rule. Egypt was also prosperous until the Turks took over, along with parts of North Africa and regions in Spain ruled by the Moors.

The cities in Italy were among the first in Europe to become wealthy through trade. Italy was at the center of the more developed and civilized world at that time. Even though the Crusades caused a lot of destruction and loss of life, they also played a role in boosting trade and commerce.
