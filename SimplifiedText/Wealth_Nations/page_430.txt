Adam Smith said that if the price of corn goes down, it wouldn’t stop farmers from growing it. In fact, if silver becomes more valuable because corn is cheaper, it could help the country sell more stuff to other countries. This would make businesses stronger and help them grow. 

The amount of corn people buy at home depends on how much other stuff is being made in the country. If there are more people making other things, they can trade for corn. The home market is the most important place to sell corn because it’s nearby and easy to access. So, if silver’s value goes up because corn is cheaper, it could actually help sell more corn and encourage farmers to grow even more.

According to a law from King Charles II, if the price of wheat at home was below a certain amount, there would be a tax on it. This tax was really high when the price was low, making it hard to import wheat. For other grains, there were also high taxes based on their prices. 

Before the current king’s law, here are some of the taxes for different grains:

- Beans: If the price is up to 28s, the tax is 19s:10d. If it goes to 40s, the tax is 16s:8d, and then it drops to 12d.
- Barley: Same as beans for the first two prices, then it goes to 12d.
- Malt: It can’t be imported because of a special tax.
- Oats: Up to 16s, the tax is 5s:10d, then it drops to 9½d.
- Peas: Up to 40s, the tax is 16s:0d, then it drops to 9¾d.
- Rye: Up to 36s, the tax is 19s:10d, then it drops to 12d.
- Wheat: Up to 44s, the tax is 21s:9d, then it drops to 17s, and finally to about 1s:4d when it goes above £4.
- Buckwheat: Up to 32s, the tax is 16s.

These taxes were set by different laws over time, replacing older taxes and adding new ones.
