Adam Smith says that workers who get paid by how much they produce often end up working too hard and damaging their health in just a few years. For example, a carpenter in London usually can’t keep up his best work for more than eight years. This happens in many jobs where workers are paid based on how much they make, like in factories or even in farming when the pay is higher than usual.

Almost every type of worker faces some health issues because they push themselves too hard at their jobs. An Italian doctor named Ramuzzini wrote a book about these kinds of illnesses. Even though soldiers aren’t seen as the hardest workers, when they do certain jobs and get paid by how much they do, their leaders often have to make rules to limit how much they can earn each day. Before these rules, soldiers would try to work too much to earn more money, which hurt their health.

Working too hard for several days can make people really tired and lead them to take a break for the next few days, which is something people complain about. When someone works a lot, whether with their mind or body, they usually feel the need to relax afterward. If they don’t get that break, it can be harmful and sometimes even dangerous, leading to health problems related to their job. If bosses listened to reason and cared about their workers, they would often need to slow down their workers instead of pushing them to work harder.

It seems that workers who pace themselves and work steadily tend to stay healthier longer and get more done over the year. Some people think that when times are tough, workers are more active, and when times are good, they are lazier. It’s true that having enough food can make some workers less motivated, but it’s hard to believe that most people work better when they’re not well-fed, feeling down, or sick compared to when they are healthy and in a good mood.
