The Wealth of Nations says that most countries had more problems than benefits from their systems. 

Money and credit are not reliable enough to be the main way for a government to make money. They can’t provide the steady income that a government needs to be strong and respected. No big country that has moved beyond basic farming has mainly relied on these sources for its income.

Land is a much more stable way to make money. The rent from public lands has been the main way many advanced nations have earned their income. Ancient Greece and Italy got most of their money from the rent of public lands, which helped pay for the things they needed. In Europe, kings also got a lot of their income from crown lands.

Today, wars and preparing for wars cost a lot for big countries. But in ancient Greece and Italy, every citizen was a soldier and paid for their own gear and training. So, this didn’t cost the state much money. The rent from a small piece of land could cover all the other costs of running the government.

In ancient European monarchies, the people were used to fighting, and when they went to war, they either paid for themselves or their lords did, so it didn’t cost the king extra. Other government expenses were usually low. Justice systems didn’t cost much; instead, they made money. Farmers worked for three days before and after harvest to help build and maintain roads and bridges needed for trade. Back then, the king’s biggest expense was taking care of his family. The people in charge of his household were also the main government officials. The treasurer managed the money, while others took care of the king’s family and properties.
