The Wealth of Nations

In Great Britain, some money for the war was expected to come from the different colonies in America and the West Indies. But would people really want to lend money based on a fund that relied on the goodwill of those faraway colonies? Sometimes, those colonies might not even care much about what happened in the war. Because of this, it’s likely that not much money would be raised, only what taxes in Great Britain could cover.

This means that the entire debt from the war would fall on Great Britain, not on the whole empire. Great Britain is unique because, as it grew its empire, it only increased its costs without getting more resources. Other countries usually found ways to lessen their expenses by making their colonies pay for defending the empire. But Great Britain has let its colonies avoid most of these costs.

To make things fair between Great Britain and its colonies, it seems necessary for the British Parliament to have a way to enforce taxes on the colonies if their assemblies try to ignore them. However, it’s not clear how they would do this, and no one has explained it yet.

If the British Parliament fully establishes the right to tax the colonies without needing their assemblies' approval, the power of those assemblies would disappear. This would also mean that the importance of the leaders in British America would be gone. People want to be involved in public affairs mainly because it gives them importance. The stability of any free government depends on how the leading people protect their own importance.

In the constant struggle for power, leaders in America, like those in other countries, want to keep their status. They worry that if their assemblies, which they like to call parliaments and see as equal to the British Parliament, become just servants of that Parliament, they will lose much of their importance.
