The Wealth of Nations

When a person goes through school, they learn habits that can help them later in life. But if they don’t keep learning, those habits can fade away. Right now, universities are losing their good reputation, and that’s why some people think it’s okay for young adults to travel instead of focusing on their education. When a dad sends his son abroad, he gets a break from worrying about a son who isn’t doing anything with his life and might be messing up.

Different times and places have had their own ways of educating people. In ancient Greece, every free citizen learned physical training and music, guided by public leaders. The physical training was meant to make them strong and brave for war. Since the Greek army was one of the best ever, this training worked really well. Music was supposed to make people kinder and better at dealing with others, helping them with their social and moral responsibilities.

In ancient Rome, they had similar physical training at a place called the Campus Martius, which worked just as well as the Greek gym. However, the Romans didn’t have a music education like the Greeks did. Still, the Romans were known to have better morals in both their personal and public lives compared to the Greeks. Historians like Polybius and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, who knew both cultures well, said that Romans were better in private life. Overall, Roman public morals were also seen as superior. 

One important part of a free society is how well different groups get along. Greek factions often fought violently, while Roman factions rarely shed blood until a certain point in history. After that, the Roman republic started to fall apart. Even though respected thinkers like Plato, Aristotle, and Polybius had their opinions, the reality of the situation showed a different story.
