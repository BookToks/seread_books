Adam Smith talks about how taxes work and their effects on people. 

He says that tax collectors have a lot of power. They can make taxes higher for people they don’t like or scare them into giving them extra money. This uncertainty about taxes can make tax collectors act badly, even if they aren’t usually rude or dishonest. Knowing exactly how much tax someone has to pay is really important. A little unfairness in taxes isn’t as bad as not knowing what you have to pay.

Every tax should be collected at a time that makes it easy for people to pay. For example, if there’s a tax on rent, it should be collected when people usually pay their rent. Taxes on fancy items are usually paid by the person buying them, and they can pay a little at a time whenever they buy something. If someone doesn’t want to pay a tax, they can choose not to buy those items.

Taxes should be designed to take as little money from people as possible while still helping the government. Sometimes, taxes can end up costing people more than they bring in. For example, if a lot of workers are needed to collect taxes, their salaries might take away most of the money collected. Taxes can also make people less motivated to work in certain jobs, which can hurt the economy. 

If someone tries to avoid paying taxes and gets caught, they can face heavy penalties that might ruin them financially. Badly designed taxes can encourage people to cheat, and then the law punishes them for it, which doesn’t seem fair.
