Adam Smith talks about Christopher Columbus and his discoveries in the Indies. Columbus believed that the places he found were the same as those described by Marco Polo and were close to the Ganges River and the lands conquered by Alexander the Great. Even when he realized they were different, he still thought these rich lands were nearby. So, on his next trip, he searched for them along the coast of what is now Panama.

Because of Columbus's mistake, the name "Indies" stuck to these new lands. Later, when people figured out that the new Indies were not the same as the old ones, they started calling the new ones the West Indies and the old ones the East Indies. Columbus wanted to show the Spanish court that the places he discovered were really important, but at that time, there wasn't much to prove that.

In St. Domingo, the biggest animal was a creature called the cori, which looked like a mix between a rat and a rabbit. It wasn't very common, and the dogs and cats brought by the Spaniards nearly wiped it out. Along with some small animals, the cori and a large lizard called the iguana were the main sources of meat for the people living there.

The plants they grew for food weren't super plentiful because they didn't work very hard, but they did have some crops. They grew things like corn, yams, potatoes, and bananas, which were all new to Europe and weren't really valued there compared to the grains and beans that Europeans had been growing for a long time.

The cotton plant was important because it was used to make valuable products. Back then, Europeans really liked cotton goods from the East Indies, but they didn't grow cotton themselves. So, even though cotton was valuable, it didn't seem like a big deal to Europeans at that time.
