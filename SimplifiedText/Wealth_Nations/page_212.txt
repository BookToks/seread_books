In public discussions, Adam Smith's voice isn't really heard or respected, except when he gets loud and is backed by his bosses, but that's usually for their own reasons, not his.

His bosses are the third group of people who make money from profits. The money they invest helps drive most of the useful work in society. Their plans and ideas control important work, and making a profit is what they aim for. But unlike rent and wages, profits don't always go up when things are good and down when things are bad. In fact, profits are usually lower in rich countries and higher in poor ones, and they tend to be highest in places that are falling apart.

So, the interests of this third group don’t connect with what’s good for society like the other two groups do. Merchants and big manufacturers are the main people in this group who use a lot of money and get a lot of attention. Since they spend their lives on business plans, they often understand things better than most country gentlemen. But they usually focus more on their own business interests rather than what’s best for everyone. Even when they try to be honest, their opinions are more reliable for their own business than for society as a whole. 

They know their own interests better than the country gentlemen know theirs. Because of this, they often trick the gentlemen into giving up their own interests and the public's interests, thinking that what’s good for the dealers is good for everyone. However, the interests of people in specific trades can be different from what’s good for the public. Dealers want to make the market bigger and reduce competition. Making the market bigger can sometimes help the public, but reducing competition usually hurts it. This allows dealers to raise their profits unfairly, which is like putting a tax on everyone else. So, any new laws or trade rules suggested by this group should be approached with caution.
