The Wealth of Nations

The balance between money saved and money spent seems to control how much work gets done and how much time people waste. When people save money, they tend to work more; when they spend it, they relax more. So, when someone saves or spends money, it can change how much work is done and how many people are working. This also affects the overall wealth and income of everyone in the country.

People can grow their savings by being careful with their money, but they can lose it by being wasteful or making bad choices. When someone saves money from what they earn, they add it to their savings. They can either use that money to pay more workers or lend it to someone else who will use it to pay workers, usually for a profit. Just like an individual can only grow their savings by saving part of what they earn, a whole society can only grow its savings the same way.

Being careful with money, not just working hard, is what really helps savings grow. Work creates the products, but if no one saves money, those products won’t lead to more savings. Saving money helps create more jobs, which adds value to what the country produces. This leads to more work being done and increases the overall value of what the country makes each year.

What gets saved each year is used up just like what gets spent, but by different people. When a rich person spends their money, it often goes to guests and servants who don’t give anything back. But when they save some of that money, it gets used by workers and manufacturers who create new products and make a profit from what they use. If the rich person had spent all their money, the food, clothes, and housing it could buy would mostly go to those guests and servants. By saving some of it, that saved money can be used to help create more goods and services.
