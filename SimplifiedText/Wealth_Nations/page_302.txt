Adam Smith

A country can often get what it needs more easily and for less money through trade than in other ways. I will talk more about whether sending metals out of the country can hurt it later.

When a country uses its money for shipping goods, that money is not helping its own workers. Instead, it supports workers in other countries. For example, when a Dutch merchant ships grain from Poland to Portugal and brings back fruits and wine, the money made from this trade doesn’t help Dutch workers. It helps Polish and Portuguese workers instead. The only benefit for Holland is the profits that come back, which add to its economy.

If a country uses its own ships and sailors for this trade, then some of the money spent on shipping goes to local workers. Most countries that have a big part in shipping trade do it this way. This is probably why the trade is called "carrying trade," since people from those countries are the ones doing the carrying. However, it’s not necessary for the trade to be done this way. A Dutch merchant could use British ships to move goods between Poland and Portugal. 

This is why carrying trade is thought to be especially good for a country like Great Britain, which relies on having many sailors and ships for its safety. But the same amount of money could also hire just as many sailors and ships for local trade or other types of foreign trade. The number of sailors and ships that can be used doesn’t depend on the type of trade but on how heavy the goods are compared to their value and how far they need to go. For example, the coal trade from Newcastle to London uses more ships than all of England's carrying trade, even though the ports are not far apart.
