The Wealth of Nations

Manufacturers usually rely on their work for money, while soldiers depend on their pay. One group is used to working hard, and the other often doesn’t do much. It’s definitely easier to switch from one type of job to another than to get someone who is lazy to start working. 

Many types of manufacturing jobs are similar, so workers can easily move from one job to another. Most workers also sometimes do farm work. The money that used to pay them in one job will still be around, just used to pay people in a different job. Even if the jobs change, the need for workers stays about the same.

When soldiers and sailors finish their service, they can work any job they want in Great Britain or Ireland. Everyone else should have the same freedom to choose their jobs, just like soldiers do. This means getting rid of special rules that only help certain groups and allowing workers to look for jobs anywhere without fear of getting in trouble. If some manufacturers lose their jobs, it won’t be a bigger deal than when soldiers are let go. Manufacturers are important, but they shouldn’t be treated better than those who fight for the country.

Hoping that trade will be completely free in Great Britain is unrealistic, just like dreaming of a perfect society. People have strong opinions against it, and many individuals have their own interests that make it hard to change. If army officers fought as hard to keep their numbers down as manufacturers do to limit competition, it would be just as risky to try to reduce the army as it is to challenge the manufacturers.
