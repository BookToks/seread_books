The Wealth of Nations

It's easier for landlords to change the corn rent based on the yearly price of grain rather than a fixed price. But some writers who looked at old grain prices often confused what’s called the conversion price in Scotland with the actual market price. Fleetwood admitted he made this mistake once. He wrote his book for a specific reason but didn’t mention this mistake until he had copied the conversion price fifteen times. The price was eight shillings for a quarter of wheat. Back in 1423, when he started, that amount of money was worth the same as sixteen shillings today. But by 1562, when he finished, it was worth the same as it is now.

Also, some people got confused because old laws about prices were sometimes copied poorly by lazy writers or maybe even written badly by lawmakers. 

These old laws usually started by saying what the price of bread and ale should be when wheat and barley were at their lowest prices. Then, they would gradually set prices as those grains got more expensive. But the people copying these laws often thought it was enough to just write down the lowest prices and skip the rest. This saved them work, and they probably thought it showed how prices should go up. 

For example, in the law from the 51st year of Henry III, the price of bread was set based on wheat prices from one shilling to twenty shillings for a quarter. But in the copies used to print the laws, they only wrote down prices up to twelve shillings. So, many writers, misled by this mistake, assumed that the average price of wheat was six shillings, which is about eighteen shillings today.

In another law about ale, made around the same time, the price was set to go up every sixpence as barley prices rose, starting from two shillings to four shillings for a quarter. However, four shillings wasn't seen as the highest price barley could reach, and these prices were just examples of how other prices should be adjusted.
