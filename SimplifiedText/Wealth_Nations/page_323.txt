People used to rely on powerful lords for protection, and to get that, they had to either become their slaves or join together to protect each other. The people living in cities didn’t have the strength to defend themselves alone, but when they teamed up with their neighbors, they could fight back effectively. The lords looked down on the city folks, seeing them as a lower class, almost like freed slaves who were different from them. The lords were always jealous of the city people’s wealth and often took advantage of them without feeling guilty. Naturally, the city folks hated and feared the lords.

They suggested two main ideas. One was to create a new system of local government by setting up leaders and town councils in important towns. The other was to form a...
