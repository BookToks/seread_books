Adam Smith

People often act together as if they are all following one leader, even if they aren’t. Sometimes, they really are being led by someone. Their interests as a group don’t always match what the ruler wants, and sometimes they are completely different. Their main goal is to keep their power over the people. This power relies on how important and certain their beliefs seem, and they want everyone to follow these beliefs without question to avoid terrible consequences.

If the ruler makes fun of or doubts even a small part of their beliefs, or tries to help those who do, the religious leaders get really upset. They might label the ruler as disrespectful and use fear to get the people to support a more obedient leader. If the ruler challenges their demands, they face big risks too. Rulers who have stood up to the church often get accused of not just rebellion but also heresy, even if they claim to follow the faith and obey the church's rules.

Religion holds more power than any other authority. The fears that come from religion can overpower all other fears. When religious leaders spread ideas that go against the ruler’s authority, the ruler can only keep control through force or a strong army. But even a strong army isn’t a guarantee of safety because if the soldiers come from the same people, they might start believing those rebellious ideas too.

The chaos caused by the Greek clergy in Constantinople and the troubles caused by the Roman clergy in Europe show how unstable a ruler’s position can be if they can’t influence the religious leaders of their country. Matters of faith and other spiritual issues aren’t really the ruler’s job. While they might be good at protecting the people, they’re not usually seen as good at teaching them about these beliefs. So, their authority in these areas is often weak.
