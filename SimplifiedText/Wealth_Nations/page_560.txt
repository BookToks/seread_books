Adam Smith talks about three main responsibilities of a government. 

First, it needs to protect its people from violence and attacks from other groups. Second, it has to make sure everyone in society is treated fairly and that justice is served. Third, the government should build and take care of public things like roads and schools that are too big or expensive for just one person or a small group to handle. These public projects are important for the whole community, even if they don’t make money for individuals.

To do these jobs, the government needs money, which means it has to collect taxes from people. In the next book, I will explain a few things. First, I’ll talk about the necessary costs for the government and which of those costs should be paid by everyone in society and which should be paid by specific groups or individuals. 

Second, I’ll go over the different ways the whole society can help cover these costs and the pros and cons of each method. Finally, I’ll discuss why many modern governments borrow money or take loans and how this affects the overall wealth and productivity of the society. So, this book will have three main chapters.
