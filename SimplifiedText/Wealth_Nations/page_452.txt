Adam Smith talks about how the gold mines in St. Domingo were abandoned and never worked again. At first, the tax on gold was really high, but it kept getting lower over time until it was just a tiny part of what was produced. The tax on silver stayed high for a long time, but it finally got lowered in the 1900s. The first explorers didn’t really care about silver; they only wanted gold.

After Columbus, the Spanish explorers were mostly driven by the desire for gold. This desire pushed people like Ovieda, Nicuessa, and Vasco Nugnes de Balboa to explore new places like the Isthmus of Darien. Cortes went to Mexico, while Almagro and Pizarro headed to Chile and Peru. Whenever they reached a new coast, their first question was always about finding gold. Based on what they learned, they decided whether to stay or leave.

However, looking for new silver and gold mines is one of the riskiest and most expensive things people can do. It’s like a bad lottery where the chances of winning are super low, and most people end up losing a lot. Even though a few people might strike it rich, many more will lose everything they invested. Mining projects often don’t make back the money spent on them, which is why smart leaders wouldn’t encourage them too much. People tend to believe they’ll get lucky, so they often invest more than they should.

Even though wise people warn against these risky projects, many still chase after the dream of finding gold and silver mines. This desire leads some to believe in silly ideas like the philosopher’s stone or that there are huge hidden mines out there. They forget that the value of gold and silver comes from how rare they are, and that rarity is what makes them special.
