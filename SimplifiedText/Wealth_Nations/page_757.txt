The Wealth of Nations talks about annuities, which are payments made for a certain number of years, like thirty-two, eighty-nine, ninety-eight, or ninety-nine years. In 1719, people who had thirty-two-year annuities were convinced to take South-sea stock instead, which was worth eleven and a half years of their annuities plus extra stock for the money they were owed. By 1720, most of the other annuities, whether long or short, were also turned into this stock. At that time, the long annuities were worth £666,821: 8:3½ a year. But by January 5, 1775, the remaining amount that wasn’t turned into stock was only £136,453:12:8d.

During the two wars that started in 1739 and 1755, not much money was borrowed using annuities for years or for lives. Even though an annuity for ninety-eight or ninety-nine years is almost as valuable as a forever annuity, people who want to invest for their family's future usually don’t want to buy something that loses value over time. This means that even though a long-term annuity might be worth the same as a forever one, it doesn’t attract as many buyers. People who sign up for a new loan usually want to sell their shares quickly, and they prefer a forever annuity that can be paid back by the government rather than a long-term one that can’t be paid back.

During the two wars mentioned, annuities were rarely given out unless they were extra perks for people who signed up for new loans, on top of the regular interest. They weren’t the main way to borrow money but were more like a bonus for lenders. Annuities for lives can be given out in two ways: for individual lives or for groups of lives, called tontines, named after their creator. When annuities are given for individual lives, when one person dies, the government doesn’t have to pay that annuity anymore. But with tontines, the government only stops paying once everyone in that group dies, which can include twenty or thirty people. The survivors then get the money from those who have passed away.
