Grenada used to be controlled by the French, and almost every plantation had a sugar refinery. But after the English took over, most of these refineries shut down. As of October 1773, there are only two or three left on the island. Right now, thanks to a rule from the customs office, clayed or refined sugar can be brought in as Muscovado if it’s turned into powder.

Great Britain is helping American factories make pig and bar iron by not charging them taxes that other countries have to pay. But at the same time, they won’t let American colonies build steel factories or mills. They want the colonies to buy all their steel products from British merchants instead of making them for themselves.

They also don’t allow goods like hats, wool, and woolen products made in America to be moved from one province to another, whether by boat or even by horse or cart. This rule stops the colonies from selling these products far away and forces them to only make simple things for their own use or for neighbors nearby.

Telling a large group of people they can’t use their own resources or work in ways that benefit them is a clear violation of their rights. Even though these rules are unfair, they haven’t hurt the colonies much so far. Land is still cheap, and labor is expensive, so they can import more advanced products from Britain for less money than it would cost to make them themselves. Even if they weren’t banned from creating these products, they probably wouldn’t do it anyway because it wouldn’t be in their best interest. Right now, these restrictions might not be stopping them from working, but they feel like annoying signs of oppression imposed by jealous British merchants. If the colonies were more developed, these rules could become really unfair and hard to deal with.
