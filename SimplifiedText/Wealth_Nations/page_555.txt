The Wealth of Nations

In the past, people usually did the same job as their parents. If your dad was a priest, you became a priest. If your dad was a soldier, you became a soldier. This was true for all kinds of jobs, like laborers, weavers, and tailors. In both Egypt and India, priests were at the top of the social ladder, followed by soldiers. Farmers and laborers were considered better than merchants and factory workers.

Both countries cared a lot about farming. The ancient Egyptian kings built amazing structures to manage the Nile River's water, which people still admire today. The kings in India did similar things for the Ganges River and other rivers, even if they aren't as famous. Because of this, both countries were known for being very fertile, even though they sometimes faced food shortages. They had so many people that during good years, they could send a lot of grain to their neighbors.

The ancient Egyptians were scared of the sea, and the religion in India didn't allow people to cook food on water, which meant they couldn't go on long sea trips. So, both Egyptians and Indians had to rely on other countries to ship their extra food. This made it hard for them to sell more of their products and discouraged them from making more goods. Making things like shoes needs a bigger market than just selling raw food. For example, a shoemaker can make over 300 pairs of shoes in a year, but his family might only wear six pairs. If he doesn't have at least 50 families to sell to, he can't sell all his shoes.

In big countries like France and England, a lot of people work in farming. Some people say it's about half, others say a third, but no one thinks it's less than a fifth of all the people. Most of the food grown in France and England is eaten there, so each farmer only needs to sell to a few families to make a living.
