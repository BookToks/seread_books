Adam Smith talks about how having extra food makes it cheaper and helps people find jobs nearby. When there’s a lot of food, workers can earn more and get more things they need than in other places. They take the raw materials from the land, make products, and trade those for more materials and food.

By making things locally, they save money on transporting goods far away. They also give farmers something useful or nice in return, making it easier for farmers to get what they want. Farmers get better prices for their extra food and can buy what they need for less money. This encourages them to grow even more food and take better care of their land.

As farmers grow more, the local manufacturing grows too. Manufacturers start by selling to their own area, and as they improve their products, they can sell to farther places. Even though it’s hard to move raw food over long distances, finished products are easier to transport. For example, a piece of fine cloth might weigh only eighty pounds, but it represents the value of a lot of wool and even thousands of pounds of corn that fed the workers.

This way, the corn that would be hard to move is sent out as finished products, reaching all corners of the world. This is how places like Leeds, Halifax, Sheffield, Birmingham, and Wolverhampton developed their industries. These industries grew from farming. In Europe’s recent history, these local industries became stronger after those that were based on trade with other countries. England was known for making fine cloth from Spanish wool long before the local industries were ready to sell their products abroad. The growth of these local industries happened because of the improvements in farming.
