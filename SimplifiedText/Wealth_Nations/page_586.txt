A big part of what the government spends is on justice. The costs of running the courts could be covered by the fees people pay when they go to court. This way, the government wouldn’t have to worry about money for justice, and it could help prevent corruption. 

But it’s tricky to set these court fees fairly when the king or queen also gets a cut of the money. It’s easier to control fees when judges are the ones who benefit from them. The law can make judges follow the rules about fees, but it’s harder to make sure the king or queen does the same. 

If court fees are set clearly and paid all at once to a cashier, who then divides the money among judges after a case is decided, there’s less chance of corruption. These fees wouldn’t make lawsuits much more expensive, but they could cover all the costs of justice. Since judges wouldn’t get paid until after the case is finished, it might encourage them to work harder. 

In courts with many judges, the fees could be divided based on how much time each judge spent on a case. This would motivate judges to be more diligent. Public services work best when people are rewarded based on how well they do their jobs. 

In France, court fees (called epices and vacations) make up most of judges' earnings. After all the deductions, a judge in the second most important court in France only gets about 150 livres a year, which is around £6:11s. That’s not much, especially since that amount used to be what a regular servant earned in a year. 

Judges who work hard can earn a decent living, while lazy judges only get their small salary. These courts might not be perfect, but they haven’t been accused of corruption. 

Court fees seem to have started as the main way to pay for justice.
