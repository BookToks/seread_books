Adam Smith talks about how expensive certain things were in ancient times. For example, some dyed cloths cost a lot—like a hundred denarii, which is about £3:6s:8d for a pound. Others, dyed differently, were even pricier at a thousand denarii or £33:6s:8d for a pound. It's important to know that a Roman pound was only twelve of our ounces. The high price was mostly because of the dye used. If the cloths weren't already expensive, they probably wouldn't have spent so much on dye.

He also mentions some fancy wool pillows, called triclinaria, that people used while lounging at meals. Some of these pillows were said to cost over £30,000, and others even more than £300,000! This high price wasn't because of the dye. 

Dr. Arbuthnot noted that fashionable clothing in ancient times had less variety compared to today. The few styles we see in ancient statues support this idea. He thinks this means their clothing was cheaper overall, but that logic doesn’t really add up. When fancy clothes are super expensive, there’s usually not much variety. But when making clothes becomes cheaper, people can afford more styles. Rich people then try to stand out by having lots of different outfits instead of just one expensive one.

The main type of trade in any country happens between city folks and country folks. City people get raw materials from the country, which they use to make things and to live on. They pay the country back by sending some of these materials back as finished products. So, the trade is basically raw stuff exchanged for made stuff. If the finished products are expensive, the raw materials become cheaper. If the price of made things goes up, it can make farming less appealing because farmers get less for their crops. The less you can buy with a certain amount of raw materials, the lower their value becomes.
