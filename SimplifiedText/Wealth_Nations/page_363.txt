The Wealth of Nations

When people work for their own benefit, they often end up helping society without even trying. This happens because their efforts can lead to good results for everyone. I’ve noticed that those who claim to work for the public good usually don’t do much good at all. Most merchants don’t pretend to care about that, and they don’t need convincing to stop.

Each person knows better how to use their money and resources than any government official does. If a politician tries to tell people how to spend their money, they’re just making things complicated for themselves. No one person or group should have that kind of power, especially someone who thinks they know better than everyone else.

Giving local businesses a special advantage in the market can be a bad idea. If local products are just as cheap as foreign ones, then the rule doesn’t really help. But if local products are more expensive, it can hurt everyone. A smart person knows not to make something at home if it costs more than buying it. For example, a tailor buys shoes from a shoemaker instead of making them. The shoemaker buys clothes from a tailor. And farmers don’t make shoes or clothes; they hire others to do those jobs. They all focus on what they do best and trade for what they need.

What makes sense for a family should also make sense for a whole country. If another country can sell us something cheaper than we can make it ourselves, we should buy it from them using some of what we produce. The overall work in the country should always match the money available.
