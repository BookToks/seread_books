The Turkey market was not doing well because the country was struggling, and there was a Russian fleet nearby. Also, more and more people in northern Europe wanted British products every year. Plus, the recent changes in Poland opened up that big market, which added even more demand this year. Most of these events are temporary and random, except for the growing demand from the north. 

If the UK keeps getting cut off from this important part of the colony trade, it could cause some problems. However, since this will happen slowly, it won’t be as bad as if it all happened at once. During this time, the country’s businesses and resources might find new ways to work, so the problems won’t get too serious.

The colony trade has taken a lot of British resources and focused them on that trade instead of other areas. This has changed some direct trade with nearby countries into trade with faraway ones. In some cases, it has even shifted trade from foreign markets into just transporting goods. Overall, this has meant less productive work in the UK because it’s focused on just one market, making the entire industry less stable than if it sold to a variety of markets.

It’s important to understand the difference between the colony trade itself and the monopoly on that trade. The colony trade is always good, while the monopoly is always bad. However, the colony trade is still helpful overall, even with the negative effects of the monopoly, though it could be much better without it.

When the colony trade is free and natural, it creates a big market for British goods that are not needed in local markets or in Europe and the Mediterranean. This free trade helps the UK by encouraging more production without taking away from those closer markets.
