Adam Smith talks about how trade and goods from America help boost the economy of European countries. When more products come from America, each country gets a bigger share, which makes life better and helps people work more.

However, the strict trade rules from the mother countries can hold back the growth and enjoyment of these nations and their colonies. These rules make it harder for colonies to sell their goods, which means they can’t make as much money or enjoy what they produce. When goods are more expensive, people buy less, which hurts everyone’s economy.

The mother countries also limit the colonies to only sell to them, which is a big deal. It’s much worse to be stuck selling to just one country than to be kept out of one market while having others open. The extra goods from the colonies are what really help Europe grow and enjoy more, but the mother countries make it harder for that to happen.

Each country that has colonies benefits in two main ways. First, they get military support from the colonies, which helps protect them. Second, they gain money to help run their government. For example, Roman and Greek colonies provided both soldiers and funds when needed.
