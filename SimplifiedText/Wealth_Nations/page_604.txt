Adam Smith

Parliament doesn’t really pay much attention to how millions are spent, so it’s unlikely they’ll care about £13,000 a year. The person in charge of the money isn’t likely to know a lot about how to spend it on forts and military bases. 

The captains in the navy can check on the condition of the forts and report back, but they don’t have the power to fix any problems they find. Plus, navy captains aren’t experts in building forts. If someone on the committee messes up, the worst that can happen is they get removed from their job after three years, which doesn’t pay much anyway. This isn’t a strong enough reason for them to pay close attention to their work since they don’t have much personal interest in it.

The committee has been accused of sending poor-quality bricks and stones from England to fix Cape Coast Castle in Guinea, even though Parliament had given extra money for this. The materials were so bad that the walls had to be rebuilt from scratch. 

The forts north of Cape Rouge are paid for by the government and are directly managed by them. It’s hard to understand why the forts south of that cape, which are also partly funded by the government, are run differently. The original reason for the garrisons in Gibraltar and Minorca was to protect trade in the Mediterranean. These garrisons are properly managed by the government, not by the Turkey company. 

The government takes pride in its territory, so it’s unlikely they’ll ignore what’s needed to protect it. As a result, the garrisons in Gibraltar and Minorca have always been looked after. Even though Minorca has been taken twice and might be lost forever, that failure isn’t blamed on the government’s lack of attention. However, I’m not saying that those expensive garrisons were ever really necessary for defense.
