Adam Smith

Bringing goods to the home market could lower prices. Since both rules were made at the same time, they actually encouraged people to clear land in America instead of stopping them.

Even though pig iron and bar iron are listed as important goods, when they come from America, they don’t have to pay high taxes like those from other countries. This means that the rules help build furnaces in America more than they hurt it. Furnaces use a lot of wood and help clear land that’s covered in trees.

Some of these rules might have raised the value of timber in America, making it easier to clear land. The people who made these laws probably didn’t mean for that to happen, but it did help in a real way.

Trade between the British colonies in America and the West Indies is pretty free. These colonies are growing fast, and they buy a lot from each other. Together, they create a big market for their products.

However, England’s support for the colonies mainly focuses on selling their raw goods or very basic products. For more advanced products, British merchants want to keep those for themselves. They convinced the government to stop these kinds of businesses from starting in the colonies, either by charging high taxes or banning them completely.

For example, when Muscovado sugar from British plantations is imported, it only costs 6s:4d for every hundred weight, while white sugar costs £1:1:1, and refined sugar costs £4:2:5 8/20ths. When these high taxes were set, Britain was the only main market for the sugars from British colonies. So, it became almost impossible to sell refined sugar anywhere else, even though they produce most of it. Because of this, the process of refining sugar has thrived in French colonies but hasn’t really taken off in English colonies, except for what they need for themselves.
