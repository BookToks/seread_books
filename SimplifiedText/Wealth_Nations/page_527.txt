The Wealth of Nations

The penalties for breaking these laws are still pretty harsh. If someone tries to export wool, they have to pay a fine of 3 shillings for every pound of wool. That’s about four or five times what the wool is worth. If a merchant gets caught, they can’t collect any money owed to them from anyone else. No matter how much money they have, the law is designed to ruin them. But most people aren’t as corrupt as the ones who made this law, so I haven’t heard of anyone really taking advantage of it. 

If someone can’t pay the fines within three months after being found guilty, they can be sent away for seven years. If they come back before that time is up, they can be punished even more severely. The owner of the ship involved in the crime loses everything they own related to that ship. The captain and crew also lose their belongings and can go to jail for three months. Later laws made the captain’s punishment even worse, increasing their jail time to six months.

To stop wool from being exported, there are a lot of strict rules. Wool can only be packed in special leather or cloth packs, and the outside must say "WOOL" or "YARN" in big letters. If not, the owner loses the wool and has to pay 8 shillings for every pound. Wool can’t be loaded onto horses or carts or carried within five miles of the coast, except during the day. If they break this rule, they lose the wool and the horses or carts. 

In the area near the coast, if someone moves wool that’s worth less than £10, the local community loses £20. If it’s worth more, they lose three times that amount plus extra costs. The punishment can be enforced against any two people in the area, and the community has to pay them back. If someone tries to settle for less than the penalty, they can go to jail for five years, and anyone else can report them.

These rules apply all over the country. But in Kent and Sussex, the rules are even stricter. Anyone with wool within ten miles of the coast has to write down how much wool they have and report it three days in advance.
