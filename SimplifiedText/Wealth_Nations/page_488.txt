Adam Smith talks about how long goods can sit in a warehouse without being sold. Sometimes, they can sit there for a while. If the colonies had been able to sell their tobacco to places other than Great Britain, they probably wouldn’t have sent us much more than what we needed for ourselves.

Right now, Great Britain buys a lot of tobacco and then sells a lot of it to other countries. If they could sell to more places, they would likely produce more of their own goods instead. Instead of focusing on one big market, they could have made things for many smaller markets. This means that instead of just one big trade route, Great Britain could have had many smaller trade routes.

Because these smaller trades would happen more often, they wouldn’t need as much money to keep them going. This would still keep British workers busy and support the country’s farms and factories. With less money needed for trade, there would be extra money available for other things, like improving farms, making more products, and expanding trade. This could help Great Britain compete better with other countries.

The way the colonies trade has also shifted some of Great Britain's money from selling goods to just moving them around. This means that instead of helping British workers, some money is now used to support the colonies and other countries.

For example, Great Britain sells a lot of tobacco each year, but not all of it is used in Great Britain. Some of it is used to buy things like linen from Germany and Holland, which goes back to the colonies. The money that Great Britain uses to buy the tobacco ends up being used to support the colonies and other countries instead of helping British workers.
