These exclusive companies are a problem in many ways. They make things harder for the countries where they are set up and can really hurt the countries that are controlled by them.

CHAPTER VIII  
CONCLUSION OF THE MERCANTILE SYSTEM

The mercantile system tries to make countries richer by promoting exports and limiting imports. But for some specific goods, it seems to do the opposite: it stops exports and encourages imports. The main goal is always to make the country richer by having a good balance of trade. 

It discourages exporting materials and tools so that our workers can compete better and sell for less than workers from other countries. By limiting the export of a few less valuable items, it hopes to increase the export of more valuable goods. It also promotes importing materials so our people can make things cheaper, which helps avoid importing more expensive finished products. I donâ€™t see any laws that support importing certain goods.
