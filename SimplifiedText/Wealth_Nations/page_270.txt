Adam Smith

The work that people do, no matter how important or helpful it is, doesn't create anything that can be traded for the same amount of work later. For example, the protection and safety of the country that comes from their work this year won’t pay for the same protection next year. 

There are many jobs that fit into this category, from serious ones like church leaders, lawyers, and doctors to lighter ones like actors, comedians, musicians, and dancers. The work done by even the least important of these jobs has value, just like any other job. But the work done by the most important jobs doesn’t create anything that can be traded for an equal amount of work later. Just like an actor’s performance, a speaker’s speech, or a musician’s song, all their work disappears as soon as it’s done.

Both productive workers and those who don’t work at all are supported by what the land and labor of the country produce each year. This production can’t go on forever and has limits. So, depending on how much of this production is used to support those who don’t work, there will be more or less left for those who do work, which will affect how much is produced the next year. Most of what is produced each year comes from productive work.

Even though everything produced is meant to supply what people need and earn them money, when it first comes from the ground or from workers, it splits into two parts. One part, often the bigger one, is used to replace what was taken from the capital, like supplies and materials. The other part is for making money for the owner of that capital, either as profit or rent. For example, from the land’s produce, one part goes to replace what the farmer used, and the other part goes to pay the farmer’s profit and the landlord’s rent. Similarly, in a big factory, one part goes to replace what the owner used, and the other part pays the owner’s profit. 

The part of the annual production that replaces capital is never used right away.
