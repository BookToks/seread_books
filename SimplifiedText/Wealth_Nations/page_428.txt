Adam Smith talks about how buying and selling corn can affect people. 

First, he says that some people think there’s a price for corn that can be raised unfairly, which can hurt others. If a merchant buys corn to sell it again soon, it’s usually because they believe there won’t be enough corn later, so the price will go up. If they’re wrong and the price doesn’t go up, they lose money not just from the sale but also from the costs of storing the corn. So, they end up hurting themselves more than the people who can’t buy corn that day, because those people can still find corn at a good price later.

If the merchant is right, instead of hurting everyone, they actually help people. By making them aware of a shortage earlier, they prevent people from using up all the corn too quickly when it’s cheap. When there’s a real shortage, it’s better for everyone to share the difficulties over time. The corn merchant has a strong reason to make this happen, and since no one else can do it as well, the corn trade should be left to them.

People often worry about merchants buying up too much corn, kind of like how people used to fear witches. Those accused of witchcraft were often innocent, just like merchants accused of unfair practices. A law that stopped witch hunts helped reduce those fears. Similarly, a law that allows free trade of corn would likely help ease worries about merchants buying too much corn.
