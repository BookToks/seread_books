The Wealth of Nations

The price of sugar didn’t go up after a tax was added, which means the producers couldn't charge more than before. Before the tax, sugar was sold at a really high price because only a few people controlled it. This shows that sugar was actually a good thing to tax since the profits from monopolies are usually the best targets for taxes. 

On the other hand, barley has never been sold at a super high price. The rent and profit from barley fields have always been fair compared to other equally good land. Taxes on malt, beer, and ale didn’t lower the price of barley. Instead, the cost of malt for brewers has gone up with the taxes, and those taxes have either made beer and ale more expensive or made them worse quality for consumers. In the end, it’s the consumers who pay these taxes, not the producers.

The only people who might be affected by the proposed changes are those who brew beer for themselves. However, it’s really unfair that wealthy people don’t have to pay the same heavy taxes that poor workers do. This should change, even if the system doesn’t change at all. The wealthy have likely stopped changes that could help both the government earn more money and help regular people.

Besides the taxes mentioned, there are other taxes that affect prices in a less direct way. These are called duties, like tolls for using roads or canals, which were originally meant to help maintain them. These duties should be based on how heavy or large the goods are. They were usually local taxes managed by towns or communities that were supposed to use the money for local needs. But in many places, the government has taken control of these duties, often raising the costs and ignoring how the money is used.
