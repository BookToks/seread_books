Salt has been taxed for a really long time, going back to the Romans, and it’s still taxed in almost every part of Europe today. People don’t buy a lot of salt at once, so a tax on it doesn’t feel like a big deal to most folks. In England, the tax on salt is three shillings and fourpence for a bushel, which is about three times what it originally costs. In some other countries, the tax is even higher.

Leather is something we really need, and linen makes soap important too. In places where winter nights are long, candles become essential. In Great Britain, leather and soap are taxed at three halfpence per pound, and candles at one penny. These taxes can add up to about eight to ten percent for leather, twenty to twenty-five percent for soap, and fourteen to fifteen percent for candles. Even though these taxes are lighter than the one on salt, they still make things more expensive for hardworking people, which can lead to higher wages.

In a cold country like Great Britain, fuel is super important during winter—not just for cooking but also for keeping many workers comfortable indoors. Coal is the cheapest fuel available. The price of fuel affects how much workers get paid, so many factories are located in coal-producing areas. Other regions can’t compete because fuel costs too much. In some industries, like glass and metal production, coal is essential. 

If there was ever a good reason for a government reward, it might be to help transport coal from places where it’s cheap to places where it’s needed. But instead of a reward, the government charges a tax of three shillings and threepence per ton on coal transported by sea, which is more than sixty percent of its original price. Coal moved by land or inland waterways doesn’t have to pay this tax. Where coal is naturally cheap, it can be used without extra costs, but where it’s expensive, there’s a heavy tax.

These taxes do raise the cost of living and, as a result, the wages of workers, but they also bring in a lot of money for the government, which might be hard to replace. So, there are good reasons to keep these taxes in place.
