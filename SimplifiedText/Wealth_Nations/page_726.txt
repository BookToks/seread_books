Adam Smith talks about how most of the money the government makes from taxes comes from customs duties. Right now, many taxes on foreign products are not really about making money for the government. Instead, they are meant to help local businesses by giving them an edge in the market.

If we got rid of strict rules and just taxed foreign products a little, our local workers would still have a good chance to compete. Plus, some products that don’t make much money for the government now could actually bring in a lot more cash.

Sometimes, high taxes make people buy less of the taxed items or even lead to smuggling. This can mean the government ends up making less money than if the taxes were lower. 

If the government is getting less money because people are buying less, the solution is simple: lower the tax. If it’s because smuggling is happening more, there are two ways to fix it. One way is to make it less tempting to smuggle by lowering the tax. The other way is to make smuggling harder by improving how customs are managed.

From what we’ve seen, the rules for excise taxes are better at stopping smugglers than customs rules. If customs had a system like excise, it would be much harder to smuggle. Many people think this change could be made easily.

Merchants who bring in goods that have customs duties could choose to either take them to their own warehouse or to a public warehouse. If they choose their own, they would have to pay the duties right away and wouldn’t get that money back. Their warehouse would also be checked regularly by customs officers to make sure everything is correct. If they use the public warehouse, they wouldn’t have to pay duties until they take the goods out.
