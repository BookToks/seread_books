The Wealth of Nations

We need to look at how much the forced export of corn has raised its price in our local market. 

At the end of this chapter, you’ll find a special report about ten years that is separate from the others. There’s also a report about the ten years before that, which shows an average that is lower, but not by much, than the overall average for the first sixty-four years of the century. The year 1740 was really tough because there wasn’t much corn. 

The twenty years before 1750 were quite different from the twenty years before 1770. The first twenty years had prices lower than the average for the century, even with a couple of expensive years. The second twenty years had prices higher than average, even with a couple of cheaper years, like in 1759. If the first group wasn’t as low as the second group was high, it’s probably because of the government’s help. The change happened too quickly to be because of a slow change in the value of silver. It’s likely due to sudden changes in the weather.

In Great Britain, the money people earn for work has gone up this century. This seems to be because there’s a higher demand for workers, thanks to the country doing really well. In France, which isn’t doing as well, the money people earn has been slowly going down along with the price of corn. In both the last century and this one, workers there earn about one-twentieth of the average price of a certain amount of wheat. 

In Great Britain, the actual value of what workers can buy with their money has increased a lot this century.

This is due to the good situation in the country.

After America was discovered, silver prices stayed about the same or only slightly lower for a while. Mining profits were really high for some time, much more than usual. Those who brought in silver...
