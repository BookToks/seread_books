The Wealth of Nations aimed to help a country get richer by reducing how much it buys from other countries and increasing how much it sells to them. The main ways to do this were to limit imports and encourage exports.

There were two main types of limits on imports. 

First, the country tried to stop importing goods that could be made at home, no matter where they came from. 

Second, it restricted imports from countries that were not good for trade, meaning the country was losing money from those trades. 

These limits could be in the form of high taxes or complete bans on certain goods.

To encourage exports, the country used a few different methods. Sometimes they offered refunds on taxes for goods that were made at home and then sold abroad. Other times, they gave money to support new businesses or industries that needed help. 

They also made special trade agreements with other countries to give their goods and merchants better deals than those from other countries. 

By setting up colonies in faraway places, they could gain special rights and sometimes even a monopoly, meaning they were the only ones allowed to sell certain goods there.

These two types of import limits, along with the four ways to encourage exports, are the main strategies to help a country increase its wealth by improving trade. I will look at each of these strategies in detail later. For now, I’ll focus on how they might affect the country’s overall production. Depending on whether they help or hurt production, they will also impact the country's real wealth and income.
