Adam Smith talks about how towns started forming their own local armies, led by their own leaders, to help the king when needed. This is when cities in France began to have their own leaders and councils. During tough times for the rulers from the Suabia family, many free towns in Germany got their first rights, and the powerful Hanseatic League was formed.

Back then, city militias were just as strong as those in the countryside. They could gather quickly, which often helped them win fights against local lords. In places like Italy and Switzerland, where the king lost control for various reasons, cities became independent and defeated nearby nobles. They forced these nobles to destroy their castles and live peacefully in the cities. This is how the republic of Berne and other Swiss cities came to be. Except for Venice, which has a different story, this was the case for many important Italian republics that rose and fell between the late 1100s and early 1500s.

In countries like France and England, the king's power was often weak but never completely gone. Because of this, cities couldn't become fully independent. However, they became so important that the king couldnâ€™t tax them without their permission. They had to send representatives to the kingdom's general assembly, where they worked with the clergy and barons to help the king when needed. Since city representatives usually supported the king, they sometimes balanced out the power of the powerful lords. This is how city representation started in the general assemblies of major European monarchies.

As a result, cities developed order and good governance, which helped protect people's freedom and safety. Meanwhile, people living in the countryside were often vulnerable to violence. In this defenseless situation, they were usually just focused on getting by, as trying to gain more could lead to trouble from those who were unjust.
