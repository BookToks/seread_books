North America is a lot richer than any part of England. However, workers in North America get paid way more than those in England. For example, in New York back in 1773, regular workers made about three shillings and sixpence a day, which is like two shillings in English money. Ship carpenters earned ten shillings and sixpence, plus a pint of rum worth sixpence, making it about six shillings and sixpence in total. House carpenters and bricklayers made eight shillings, which is about four shillings and sixpence in English money. Tailors earned five shillings, which is around two shillings and tenpence. All these wages are higher than what workers get in London, and wages in other colonies are said to be just as good as in New York. 

Food prices in North America are much lower than in England, and they’ve never really faced a shortage. Even in tough times, they always have enough food for themselves, even if they can’t export much. So, since workers earn more money in North America, their ability to buy what they need and want is even better.

Even though North America isn’t as rich as England yet, it’s growing faster and getting richer quickly. One big sign of a country doing well is how fast its population grows. In Great Britain and most of Europe, it takes about five hundred years for the population to double. But in the British colonies in North America, it takes only about twenty to twenty-five years. This growth isn’t just because new people are moving in; it’s mostly because families are having more kids. 

People who live a long time often have fifty to a hundred grandchildren or even more. Work is so well paid that having a lot of kids is actually a good thing for parents, not a burden. Each child is thought to be worth a lot of money to their family. A young widow with several kids, who might struggle to find a new husband in Europe, is often seen as someone with good fortune in North America. The value of kids encourages people to get married. That’s why many people in North America tend to marry young. Even with all the new families, there’s still a big need for workers in North America. It seems like the need for laborers is growing even faster than the money available to support them.
