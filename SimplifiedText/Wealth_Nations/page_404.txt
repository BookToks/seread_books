Bounties for exporting goods are often requested and sometimes given in Great Britain. These bounties are supposed to help our merchants and manufacturers sell their products at prices that are as low or lower than their competitors in other countries. This way, they can sell more goods abroad, which is believed to help our country’s economy.

We can’t force other countries to buy our goods like we can with people in our own country. So, the next best idea is to pay them to buy our products. This is how the mercantile system thinks it can make the whole country richer and put money in everyone’s pockets through trade.

Bounties should only go to businesses that really need them to survive. If a merchant can sell their goods for a price that covers their costs and gives them a normal profit, they don’t need a bounty. These businesses are just as good as others that don’t get bounties, so they shouldn’t need one either. Bounties are only needed for businesses where merchants have to sell their goods for less than what it costs them to get them to market. The bounty helps cover that loss and encourages them to keep going or start a business that might not make enough money otherwise.

It’s important to note that only the businesses that get bounties can keep trading with other countries for a long time, while one side consistently loses money or sells their goods for less than what it costs to sell them. If the bounty didn’t help the merchant recover their losses, they would quickly have to find a different way to use their money or look for a business where they could earn back their costs and make a profit.
