The Wealth of Nations might be interesting to the board of trade and plantations, which is now managed by a committee from the privy council. If someone wants to appeal against a bye-law, they have to do it within twelve months after it was made. If seven members feel wronged by a bye-law that was made before this act, they can also appeal, but they must do it within twelve months after this act starts. 

However, one year might not be enough time for everyone in a big company to see how bad a bye-law can be. If some members find out later that a bye-law is harmful, the board of trade or the council can’t help them. Most bye-laws are created not just to hurt current members but also to stop new people from joining. They can do this by setting high fines or using other tricks. 

Companies always want to make as much profit as possible and keep the market low on goods they sell and buy. They do this by limiting competition and making it hard for new traders to enter the market. A fine of twenty pounds might not scare someone away from the Turkey trade if they plan to stay in it, but it could stop a new trader from trying it out. In every trade, regular traders, even if they aren’t part of a company, often team up to keep profits high. This is less likely to happen if new traders are allowed to compete. 

Even though the Turkey trade is somewhat open because of this law, many still think it’s not completely free. The Turkey company helps pay for an ambassador and a few consuls, who should really be funded by the government, and the trade should be open to all citizens. The taxes collected by the company could provide enough money for the government to support these officials. 

Sir Josiah Child pointed out that regulated companies have helped support public officials but have never built forts or military bases in the countries they trade with. On the other hand, joint-stock companies often do. It seems that regulated companies are not as good at this kind of work as joint-stock companies. First, the directors of a regulated company don’t have a strong interest in the overall success of the trade.
