The Wealth of Nations

Money and goods are not the same thing. The money we use to buy things is just a tool that helps us trade goods. When we talk about how much money a society has, we need to remember that the money itself doesn’t count as part of the total value. We have to take out the value of the money from the total amount of money and goods that are moving around. 

Sometimes, people get confused because of how we talk about money. When we say a certain amount of money, we might just mean the coins or bills themselves. Other times, we might be thinking about what we can buy with that money. For example, when we say England has eighteen million in circulating money, we are just talking about the coins and bills that are used in the country. But when we say someone earns fifty or a hundred pounds a year, we mean more than just the cash they get. We’re talking about what they can buy with that money and how they can live their life.

When we refer to a specific amount of money, we might be thinking about both the cash itself and the things we can buy with it. However, the real value comes from what that money can actually get us, not just the cash itself. For instance, if someone gets a guinea every week, they can buy food, things they need, and fun stuff with it. The more they can buy, the richer they are. Their real income isn’t just the guinea; it’s what they can get with it. If they got a piece of paper instead of a gold coin, their wealth would still be based on what they could buy with that paper, not the paper itself.
