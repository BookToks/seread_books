The Wealth of Nations

When it comes to trade, some businesses take longer to make money than others. Because of this, Great Britain has to invest more money into its colonies than it normally would. If there was a way to fix this, it might be worth giving some help. 

Right now, Great Britain is losing money by trying to control its colonies. 

If someone suggested that Great Britain should just let its colonies run their own affairs, choose their own leaders, make their own laws, and decide when to go to war or make peace, that would be something no country would ever actually do. No country willingly gives up control over a place, no matter how annoying it is to manage or how little money it brings in. Giving up control might be good for the country, but it hurts their pride, and it’s not in the best interest of the people in charge. Those leaders would lose jobs, money, and chances to gain power, which they usually get from even the most difficult colonies. 

Even the most idealistic people wouldn’t seriously think this could happen. But if it did, Great Britain would save a lot of money by not having to support the colonies anymore. They could then make a trade agreement that would be better for the average person, even if it’s not as good for the merchants as the current setup. By parting on good terms, the colonies might start to feel connected to Great Britain again, especially after the recent conflicts. They could respect the trade deal they made when they separated and support Great Britain in wars and trade. Instead of being difficult subjects, they could become loyal allies. This could bring back the kind of relationship that used to exist between ancient Greece and its mother city.

For any province to be useful to the empire it belongs to, it should provide money during peaceful times.
