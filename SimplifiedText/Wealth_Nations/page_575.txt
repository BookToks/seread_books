The Wealth of Nations

People who used to be farmers and craftsmen started to become traders and manufacturers. Over time, the civilian side of society became more important than the military. The Roman army, which used to be strong, became weak and poorly trained. They couldn't defend themselves against attacks from groups like the Germans and Scythians, who later invaded the western part of the Roman Empire. To protect themselves, Roman emperors had to hire soldiers from these invading nations to fight against each other.

The fall of the western Roman Empire was a major change in history. It happened because the soldiers from less civilized groups were stronger than those from more civilized nations. For example, the soldiers from a nation of shepherds were better than those from a nation of farmers and craftsmen. Usually, militias won battles against other militias that were not as well trained. The Greek militia beat the Persian army, and later, the Swiss militia defeated the Austrians and Burgundians.

The German and Scythian groups that took over after the fall of the western empire kept their military style similar to what it was in their homeland. Their soldiers were mostly farmers and shepherds who fought under the same leaders they followed in peaceful times. They were fairly well trained and organized. But as society progressed and people got busier with work, the leaders lost power, and fewer people practiced for war. This led to a decline in military training, and standing armies started to replace militias. Once one civilized nation created a standing army, others felt they had to do the same to stay safe, realizing their militias couldn't defend against these new armies.

Soldiers in a standing army might not have fought in battles before, but they often seemed just as brave as experienced troops. For example, in 1756, when the Russian army entered Poland, the bravery of the Russian soldiers was just as strong as that of the Prussian soldiers, who were known for being tough and experienced.
