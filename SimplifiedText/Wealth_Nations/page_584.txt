In the past, rulers often abused their power, and this was pretty common in Europe’s history. 

When a king or leader made decisions about justice themselves, it was hard to get any help if they did something wrong. There usually wasn’t anyone strong enough to hold them accountable. Sometimes, if they used a helper, like a bailiff, to enforce the law, people could get some justice. If the bailiff did something unfair just for their own gain, the king might punish them or make them fix the problem. But if the bailiff was acting unfairly to benefit the king, it was almost impossible to get justice, just like if the king had done it himself. In many old governments, especially in Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire, the justice system was really corrupt. It wasn’t fair, even with the best kings, and it was terrible under the worst ones.

In societies where people raised animals, the leader was just the biggest herder in the group. They got their support from their own flocks. In farming communities that were just starting to move away from herding, like the Greek tribes during the Trojan War, the leader was the biggest landowner. They were supported by their own land and didn’t usually get money from their people unless they needed help against other unfair leaders. The gifts people gave to the leader when they needed help were pretty much the only income they had. For example, when Agamemnon offers Achilles control over seven Greek cities in Homer’s story, the only benefit he mentions is that people would give him gifts. As long as these gifts and the fees from justice were the main source of income,
