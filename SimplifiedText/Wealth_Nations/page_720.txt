Certain goods can be taxed before they reach the buyer, or while they are still with the seller. Goods that last a long time before being used up are usually taxed one way, while those that are used quickly are taxed another way. For example, the tax on coaches and silverware is done one way, while most other taxes on goods are done the other way.

A coach can last around ten to twelve years if taken care of. It could be taxed all at once when it’s made, but it’s easier for the buyer to pay a smaller amount each year instead of a big amount upfront. This way, they pay about four pounds a year instead of paying forty or forty-eight pounds all at once. Similarly, silverware can last over a hundred years. It’s easier for someone to pay five shillings a year for every hundred ounces of silver than to pay a huge amount all at once, which would make the price go up a lot. Taxes on houses are also easier to handle with smaller yearly payments instead of a big tax when the house is built or sold.

Sir Matthew Decker suggested that all goods, even those used quickly, should be taxed this way. The seller wouldn’t pay anything upfront; instead, the buyer would pay a yearly fee to use certain goods. The idea was to help foreign trade by removing taxes on importing and exporting, allowing merchants to use all their money to buy goods and pay for shipping without worrying about taxes. However, there are some big problems with taxing quick-use goods this way. 

First, the tax would not be fair because it wouldn’t match what people actually spend. For example, taxes on drinks like beer and wine are paid by sellers but end up being paid by buyers based on how much they drink. If the tax was instead a fee to drink, a sober person would end up paying more than someone who drinks a lot. A family that hosts many guests would pay less tax compared to a family that has fewer visitors.
