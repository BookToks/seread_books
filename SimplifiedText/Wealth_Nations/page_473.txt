The Wealth of Nations

The way a country is run really shapes its people. For example, France has a government that can be strict and harsh compared to Great Britain, but it’s still more legal and free than the governments in Spain and Portugal.

When we look at the North American colonies, we can see that England's approach is better. The sugar colonies in France have grown just as much, if not more, than many of England's colonies. However, England's sugar colonies have a government that is pretty free, similar to what we see in North America. On the other hand, France's sugar colonies are allowed to refine their own sugar, and their government treats their enslaved workers better.

In all European colonies, sugar is grown by enslaved people. It's believed that people from Europe can't handle the tough work of farming in the hot sun of the West Indies. Right now, growing sugar is all done by hand, but some think using machines could help a lot. Just like how taking care of cattle is important for farming success, taking care of enslaved people is also crucial for making money. Generally, French plantation owners are seen as better at managing their enslaved workers than the English are. 

In places where slavery exists, the law sometimes gives a little protection to enslaved people from their masters. This protection is likely to be better enforced in a place where the government has more control, rather than in a completely free country. In a free country, the person in charge might be afraid to step in because they respect the master too much. This makes it harder to help the enslaved person. But in a place where the government has more power, officials can get involved in how people manage their property. They can even punish someone if they don’t do things the right way. This makes it easier for them to protect the enslaved people, and they might feel more inclined to help out of basic human kindness.
