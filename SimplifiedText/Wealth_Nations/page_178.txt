the amount of gold that comes from gold mines. Even though the amount of gold and silver can change a lot from year to year, these changes don’t affect their prices in the same way.

Before America found its gold and silver mines, the value of gold compared to silver in Europe was about ten to twelve ounces of silver for one ounce of gold. By the middle of the last century, that changed to about fourteen to fifteen ounces of silver for one ounce of gold. This means gold became more valuable in terms of how much silver you would get for it. Both gold and silver became less valuable in terms of how much work you could get for them, but silver lost value faster than gold. Even though the American mines produced more silver and gold than any before, the silver mines were even more productive.

A lot of silver was sent from Europe to India, which made silver worth less compared to gold in some English colonies. In the mint in Calcutta, one ounce of gold is valued at fifteen ounces of silver, similar to Europe. However, this might be too high compared to what it’s really worth in the market in Bengal. In China, the value of gold to silver is still about one to ten or one to twelve, and in Japan, it’s about one to eight.

According to Mr. Meggens, the amount of gold and silver coming into Europe is about one ounce of gold for every twenty-two ounces of silver. He thinks that the large amount of silver sent to the East Indies lowers the amount of these metals left in Europe to a value ratio of one to fourteen or fifteen. He believes that the value ratio should match the amount ratio, which would be one to twenty-two if not for the extra silver being sent out.

However, the usual value ratio of two things isn’t always the same as the amount of those things available in the market. For example, if an ox costs ten guineas, that price is about sixty times the amount of something else.
