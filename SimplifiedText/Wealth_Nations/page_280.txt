Adam Smith

The number of workers who can actually produce things can’t really go up a lot unless there’s more money or resources to support them. The same group of workers can’t produce more unless they have better tools or if their jobs are organized in a smarter way. In both cases, you usually need more money to make it happen. 

If someone wants to give their workers better tools or organize their work better, they need extra funds. When a job has many parts, keeping everyone busy in one specific way takes a lot more money than if everyone does different tasks sometimes. 

When we look at a country at two different times and see that it produces more from its land and workers later on, it means that the country’s money has likely increased during that time. This means that more money was added through smart choices by some people than was taken away by bad decisions or government spending. 

This is true for almost all countries during peaceful times, even those with not-so-great governments. To really understand this, we need to compare the country’s situation over longer periods. The changes can be so slow that if we look at shorter periods, we might not notice them. Sometimes, certain industries or areas might struggle, making it seem like the whole country is doing worse, even when it’s actually doing well overall. 

For example, the total output of land and labor in England is definitely much higher than it was over a hundred years ago, around the time of Charles II. Even though most people today agree on this, there have been many times in the past where people published books or articles claiming that the country was getting poorer, that people were leaving, farming was being ignored, and businesses were failing. Not all of these writings were just lies; many were taken seriously by the public.
