Adam Smith

Because of their position, the servants are more likely to look out for their own interests, even if it hurts the country they run, than their bosses are. The country belongs to their bosses, who have to care about what they own. But the servants don’t own the country. If the bosses really understood what was best for them, it would be the same as what’s best for the country. However, the interests of the people who work for them don’t match up with the country’s interests, and knowing more wouldn’t necessarily stop them from causing problems. 

The rules sent from Europe have often been weak but well-intentioned. Sometimes, the servants in India have shown more knowledge, but not always with good intentions. It’s strange that in this government, everyone in charge wants to leave the country as soon as possible, and once they do, they don’t care what happens to it, even if it were to be destroyed.

I don’t mean to say anything bad about the general character of the East India Company servants or any specific individuals. I’m criticizing the system of government and the situation they’re in, not the people themselves. They acted according to their circumstances, and those who complain the most would probably not have done any better. In times of war and negotiation, the councils in Madras and Calcutta have shown determination and smart decision-making that would have impressed even the best leaders of ancient Rome. 

However, the members of those councils were trained for jobs very different from war and politics. But their situation seems to have brought out great qualities in them, giving them abilities and virtues they might not have realized they had. So, if sometimes they acted bravely in ways we didn’t expect, it’s not surprising that at other times, they might have done things that weren’t as admirable.
