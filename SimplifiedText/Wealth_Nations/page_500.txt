Adam Smith talks about how different parts of a country, like provinces or colonies, need to help pay for the government. Each province should contribute its fair share to help cover the costs of running the whole country. If one province doesn’t pay its part, then other provinces have to pick up the slack, which isn’t fair.

When there’s a war, provinces also need to help out with extra money, and this should be in line with what they normally contribute during peaceful times. However, it’s clear that the money coming from Britain’s colonies doesn’t match up with what the entire British Empire makes. Some people think that the monopoly (a situation where one company or group controls something) helps Britain make more money, which allows them to pay higher taxes. But this monopoly actually hurts the colonies and doesn’t help most people in Britain pay their taxes better.

The extra money that the monopoly brings in only helps a small group of people in Britain, and it’s not fair to tax them more than others. So, we can’t rely on this small group for extra funds.

Colonies can be taxed either by their own local governments or by the British Parliament. But it’s unlikely that the local governments in the colonies can raise enough money to cover their own costs and also help pay for the overall government of the British Empire. Even the British Parliament took a long time to figure out how to manage their finances properly. They had to give out jobs and responsibilities to members of Parliament to make sure they could support their own country’s military and civil needs. It’s even harder for the distant colony assemblies to manage their finances effectively.
