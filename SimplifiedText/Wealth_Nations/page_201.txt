The Wealth of Nations

The mines in America could change things a lot, but it doesn't really matter for the world's true wealth and how well people are doing. The actual value of what we produce each year from our land and work would stay the same. Sure, the amount of gold and silver we could use to show that value might change, but what really matters is how much work we can get for it. For example, a shilling might buy as little as a penny does now, and a penny could buy as much as a shilling does today. So, if you have a shilling, you wouldn’t be richer than someone with a penny, and vice versa. The only difference would be that gold and silver would be cheaper or more expensive, which wouldn’t really help or hurt anyone in a big way.

Now, about how people used to think about the value of silver. Many writers looked at how cheap things like corn were back then and thought it meant there wasn’t much gold and silver, and that the country was poor and uncivilized. This idea is tied to a way of thinking about money that says a country is wealthy if it has a lot of gold and silver, and poor if it doesn’t. I’ll explain this more in the fourth book of my study, but for now, I want to say that just because gold and silver were valuable doesn’t mean a country was poor or uncivilized. It just shows that the mines at that time weren’t producing much. A poor country can’t buy more gold and silver than a rich one, so their value wouldn’t be higher there. 

In China, which is way richer than any part of Europe, gold and silver are worth more than they are in Europe. Since the discovery of American mines, Europe has gotten richer, and the value of gold and silver has gone down. But this drop in value isn’t because Europe is producing more wealth; it’s just due to random events.
