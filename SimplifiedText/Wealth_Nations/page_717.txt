If people want to have kids, it probably won't really reduce the number of useful workers in the country. 

When the prices of basic needs go up, unless wages go up too, it makes it harder for poor people to have big families. This means they can’t provide enough workers, no matter if the need for workers is going up, staying the same, or going down.

Taxes on luxury items don’t usually make other prices go up, just the prices of the taxed items. But taxes on basic needs can raise wages, which then makes everything else cost more. This can lead to fewer people buying those products. People who buy luxury items pay these taxes directly, and they affect everyone, including workers, business owners, and landowners. 

When taxes on basic needs hit the working poor, landowners end up paying less rent, and rich buyers pay more for goods. This often means they pay a lot more than they should. For example, if the price of essential items like cheap wool clothing goes up, workers need higher wages to keep up. 

People who are better off should always be against taxes on basic needs and on workers' wages because they end up paying for it in the end, often with extra costs. Landowners feel the impact the most because they pay through lower rent and higher expenses. 

Sir Matthew Decker pointed out that some taxes can be added multiple times in the price of certain goods, and this is true for taxes on basic needs. For instance, when you buy leather shoes, you’re not just paying for the tax on your shoes, but also for the taxes on the shoes made by the shoemaker and the tanner. You also pay for the taxes on the salt, soap, and candles that those workers use while making your shoes, plus the taxes on the materials used by the people who make those items. 

In Great Britain, the main taxes on basic needs are on salt, leather, soap, and candles.
