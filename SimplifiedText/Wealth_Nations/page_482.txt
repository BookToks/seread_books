Adam Smith talks about how trade with the colonies has grown a lot since the navigation act was put in place. This act helped the colonies trade more, but it also hurt other types of trade, especially with Europe, which has been getting worse over time.

Before the navigation act, British products were made for nearby European markets or for countries around the Mediterranean. Now, most of those products are made for the colonies, where Britain has no competition. Some writers, like Sir Matthew Decker, think that the decline in other types of trade is because of high taxes, expensive labor, and more luxury spending. But really, it’s mostly because the colony trade has taken over.

Britain was already a big trading country with a lot of money to invest in trade, and this was true even before the navigation act. During the Dutch war when Cromwell was in charge, Britain had a stronger navy than Holland. Later, during another war at the start of Charles II’s reign, Britain’s navy was at least as strong as the combined navies of France and Holland. 

However, Britain’s strong navy during those wars wasn’t because of the navigation act. When the first war started, the act was just being planned. By the time the second war began, the act was officially in place, but it hadn’t had enough time to make a big difference yet, especially the part about exclusive trade with the colonies. Back then, the colonies and their trade were small compared to what they are now. For example, Jamaica was mostly a deserted and unhealthy place, and New York and New Jersey were still controlled by the Dutch.
