The Wealth of Nations

Some merchants and business owners started making products to copy what other countries were already making. These products came from trade with other countries. For example, in the 1300s, Lucca was known for making fancy fabrics like silk and velvet. But then a ruler named Castruccio Castracani kicked out a lot of families from Lucca. In 1310, about 900 families left, and 31 of them went to Venice, where they offered to start making silk. Venice accepted their offer, gave them some special rights, and they began working with 300 workers.

Similar things happened in Flanders, where they made fine cloths that later came to England when Queen Elizabeth was in charge. Today, places like Lyons and Spitalfields are known for making silk. When these types of manufacturing started, they usually used materials from other countries and copied what was already being made elsewhere. For example, when the silk industry began in Venice, all the materials came from places like Sicily and the Levant. 

Before the 1500s, people in northern Italy didn’t really grow mulberry trees or raise silk worms. France didn’t start doing this until King Charles IX was in charge. The cloth made in Flanders mostly used wool from Spain and England. The first wool industry in England used Spanish wool, which was good enough to sell far away. Even today, more than half of the silk used in Lyons comes from other countries, and when it first started, almost all of it did. Spitalfields never really uses silk made in England.

Manufacturing usually starts because a few people come up with a plan, and it can happen in a coastal city or a town further inland, depending on what they think is best. Sometimes, manufacturing grows naturally over time as people improve their basic skills and products, even in poorer areas. These products often use materials that come from the local area. This can happen in places that are not too far from the coast but still have good land that’s easy to farm, leading to a lot of extra goods being produced.
