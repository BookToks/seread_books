The Wealth of Nations

Three barrels of sea-sticks usually get turned into two barrels of sellable herrings. So, over the last eleven years, the total number of sellable herrings caught is about 252,231 barrels. During this time, the government paid out £155,463 in bounties, which is about 8s:2¼d for each barrel of sea-sticks and 12s:3¾d for each barrel of sellable herrings.

The salt used to cure these herrings can be from Scotland or other countries. Both types of salt are delivered to fish-curers without any extra tax. Right now, the tax on Scottish salt is 1s:6d, while foreign salt costs 10s per bushel. A barrel of herrings needs about one and a quarter bushels of foreign salt or two bushels of Scottish salt. If the herrings are meant for export, no tax is paid. If they are for local use, only one shilling is paid for each barrel, no matter what kind of salt was used. This tax was based on how much salt was thought to be needed to cure a barrel of herrings.

In Scotland, foreign salt is mostly used just for curing fish. From April 5, 1771, to April 5, 1782, about 936,974 bushels of foreign salt were imported, while only 168,226 bushels of Scottish salt were used. This shows that foreign salt is mainly used in fishing. For every barrel of herrings exported, there’s also a bounty of 2s:8d, and more than two-thirds of the herrings caught are exported. 

Putting all this together, over these eleven years, every barrel of herrings cured with Scottish salt cost the government 17s:11¾d when exported and 14s:3¾d when sold locally. For barrels cured with foreign salt, it cost the government £1:7:5¾d for exports and £1:3:9¾d for local sales. The price for a barrel of good sellable herrings ranges from seventeen to twenty-five shillings, averaging about a guinea.

Secondly, the bounty for catching white herrings is based on the size of the ship, not how well it catches fish. This has led to some ships going out just to get the bounty, not to actually catch fish. In 1759, when the bounty was fifty shillings per ton, the entire Scottish buss fishery only caught four barrels of sea-sticks.
