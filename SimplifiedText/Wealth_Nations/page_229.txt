People often keep some money or valuables with them to stay safe in case something bad happens. This is common in places like Turkey and India, and it used to be a normal thing for our ancestors during tough times in Europe. Back then, finding hidden treasure was a big deal and was seen as a way for kings to make money. 

If someone found treasure in the ground and no one could prove it belonged to them, it was considered the king's property. This meant that unless a special rule said otherwise, the treasure didn’t belong to the person who found it or the landowner. It was treated like gold and silver mines, which also didn’t automatically belong to the landowner unless it was specifically mentioned in their agreement. Other types of mines, like those for lead and coal, were seen as less important and were included in the land deal.

In the first part of this book, it was explained that the price of most goods is made up of three parts: the money paid for workers, the profits for the business, and the rent for the land used to make and sell the goods. Some goods only have two parts in their price, like the wages for workers and the profits. A few goods might just be based on the workers' wages. But in the end, every price includes one or more of these three parts, and anything that doesn’t go to rent or wages is profit for someone. 

So, since this is true for each item, it must also be true for all the goods that make up the total production for the year.
