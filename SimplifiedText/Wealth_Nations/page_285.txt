his money lost. 

When someone borrows money, the lender expects to get it back later and also wants to be paid some extra money for letting the borrower use it. The borrower can either use that money to invest in things that help make more money or just spend it right away. 

If the borrower uses the money to invest, they can pay back the loan and the interest without losing any other money. But if they just spend it on things that don’t help them earn more, like partying or unnecessary stuff, they’ll end up in trouble. They won’t be able to pay back the loan or the interest without taking money from somewhere else, like selling their land or other valuable things.

Most of the time, people who borrow money use it wisely to make more money rather than waste it. If someone borrows just to spend, they’ll likely end up broke, and the lender will probably lose their money too.
