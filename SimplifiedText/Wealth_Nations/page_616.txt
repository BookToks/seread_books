Adam Smith

When a country has forts and military bases in faraway places, it also gets the power to make peace or start wars there. Companies that have this power often use it, and sometimes they are even given permission to do so. It's well-known how unfair and cruel they can be in these situations.

When a group of merchants decides to take a risk and start trading with a distant and unfamiliar nation, it makes sense to form a joint-stock company. If they succeed, they might get exclusive rights to that trade for a certain number of years. This is an easy way for the government to reward them for taking on a risky and costly project that will benefit everyone later. Giving them a temporary monopoly is similar to how inventors get exclusive rights to their inventions or authors to their books. But once that time is up, the monopoly should end. The government should take control of any forts and military bases, pay the company for their value, and allow everyone in the country to trade freely.

If a company has a permanent monopoly, it unfairly taxes everyone else in two ways: first, by making goods more expensive than they would be in a free market, and second, by completely shutting out others from a business opportunity that could be good for them. This kind of tax is pointless because it only helps the company cover for their lazy and wasteful employees, who often don’t let the company make more money than what’s normal in free trades, and sometimes even less. 

However, it seems that without a monopoly, a joint-stock company can’t keep up with foreign trade for long. They need to buy goods in one place and sell them for a profit in another, all while competing with many others. They also have to keep an eye on changing demands and competition, and adjust the quantity and quality of their goods accordingly. This is like a constant battle that is always changing, and it’s really hard to win without some kind of special advantage.
