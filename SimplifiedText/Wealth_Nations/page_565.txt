The Wealth of Nations

Hunting is not a reliable way for a lot of people to survive together for a long time. But a group of shepherds can be really big, sometimes even two or three hundred thousand people. As long as they can keep moving from one area to another, where there’s still food for their animals, there’s almost no limit to how many can travel together. A group of hunters isn’t very threatening to nearby civilized nations, but a group of shepherds can be. 

Fighting between Native Americans in North America is often seen as weak, while invasions by groups like the Tartars in Asia can be really scary. A guy named Thucydides once said that Europe and Asia couldn’t handle the Scythians if they teamed up, and history has shown that to be true. The people living in the vast, open lands of Scythia or Tartary have often come together under a strong leader, causing a lot of destruction in Asia. The tough desert people of Arabia only united once, under Muhammad and his followers, and that was more about their shared beliefs than conquering others. If the hunting tribes in America ever became shepherds, they would be a bigger threat to European colonies than they are now.

In societies where people farm and don’t trade much with others, everyone can easily become a soldier. Farmers spend all day outside, dealing with all kinds of weather. This tough lifestyle helps them get ready for war since their daily work is similar to what soldiers do. For example, a farmer digging a ditch is preparing to work in trenches and build defenses. The games they play are often similar to war games, but since farmers have less free time than shepherds, they don’t play as often. They are soldiers, but they don’t practice as much. Still, it doesn’t usually cost the government much to get them ready for battle.

Farming, even at its simplest level, needs people to settle down in one place. When a nation is made up only of farmers, they can’t just leave without losing a lot.
