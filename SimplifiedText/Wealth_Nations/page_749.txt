The Wealth of Nations

Back in the day, people thought saving money was a bad thing, and there were laws against it. But during times of chaos and violence, it was smart to keep some cash handy. If they had to leave their homes, they needed something valuable to take with them to stay safe. Because of the danger, people not only saved money but also hid it away. There were many stories of treasure being found without any known owner, showing that hoarding and hiding money was common back then. Finding treasure was a big deal for kings, but today, even a wealthy person wouldn’t find treasure as important.

Kings also wanted to save money, just like regular people. In countries where trade and manufacturing weren’t common, kings tended to be careful with their money. They didn’t spend on fancy things because there weren’t many available. They didn’t need large armies, so their money mostly went to helping their tenants and being generous to their followers. Being generous usually doesn’t lead to wasting money, while being vain often does. So, many ancient kings in Europe had treasures, and even Tartar chiefs today are said to have them.

In a rich country full of luxury, kings, like other wealthy people, spend a lot of their money on expensive things. They can easily get fancy items from their own country and nearby places. To keep up with the trend, nobles often let go of their servants and make their tenants independent, becoming less important themselves, just like many wealthy townspeople. The same silly desires that drive their actions also affect the king. It’s hard to believe he wouldn’t want to enjoy these pleasures too. If he spends a lot of his money on these luxuries, it could weaken the country’s ability to defend itself.
