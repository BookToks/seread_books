The Wealth of Nations

In the early days of society, people didn't have much power over each other. Everyone was pretty equal, so there wasn't much authority or hierarchy. 

Then came the time of shepherds, where some people became really rich while others stayed poor. During this time, the rich had a lot of power, and you could see clear differences in status. For example, an Arabian leader had a lot of influence, while a Tartar leader had complete control.

Another important factor is being born into a wealthy family. If someone comes from a long line of rich people, they are often seen as better than others. However, all families have old roots, and the ancestors of a king are not necessarily more numerous than those of a poor person. Being from an old family usually means they have either money or some kind of greatness that comes with it. People tend to respect families that have been around for a long time more than those that just became powerful recently. 

People dislike those who take power unfairly and love the families of old kings because they have a natural respect for them. Just like a soldier follows a commander they've always known, people are okay with following a family they’ve always respected. But they get really upset if a new family tries to take control over them without any history of respect.

In hunter societies, everyone is pretty equal in wealth, so there isn't much difference in status based on birth. The son of a wise and brave person might get a bit more respect than the son of someone foolish or cowardly, but the difference isn't huge. There has never been a powerful family that only became great because they inherited wisdom and virtue.

In shepherd societies, birth and wealth are really important. These societies usually don’t have much luxury, and their wealth tends to stay within the same families for a long time. Because of this, there are many families that are honored because they come from a long line of respected ancestors. Birth and wealth are clearly the two main factors that affect status.
