The Wealth of Nations

To raise a family, both parents need to earn more than just enough to survive. But how much more they need to earn is hard to say. Sometimes, workers can earn more than the minimum they need because of certain situations.

When there are more jobs available than people to fill them, workers don’t need to team up to ask for higher pay. The competition among employers to hire workers drives wages up because they want to attract more people to work for them.

The number of jobs that pay wages can only go up if there’s more money available to pay those wages. There are two main sources of this money: first, the extra income that people have after taking care of their own needs, and second, the extra money that business owners have to spend on their workers.

When someone like a landlord or a wealthy person has more money than they need for their family, they might hire servants with the extra cash. If they have even more money, they’ll likely hire more servants.

Similarly, if a skilled worker like a weaver or shoemaker has more materials and money than they need for their own work, they might hire extra workers to help them make more products. If they have more money, they’ll hire more workers.

So, as a country gets richer and has more money to spend, the demand for workers who earn wages goes up. This means that wages can only increase if the country’s wealth is also increasing.

It’s not just about how rich a country is right now, but how fast it’s getting richer that affects wages. The countries that are growing the quickest tend to have the highest wages. Right now, England is one of those countries.
