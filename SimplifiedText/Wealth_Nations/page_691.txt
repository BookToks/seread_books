The way a person spends their money can be seen through how much they pay for their house. A tax on house rent could bring in more money than any other tax in Europe. But if the tax is too high, most people would try to avoid it by choosing smaller houses or spending their money elsewhere.

We can easily figure out how much rent people pay for houses, just like we do for land. Houses that aren’t lived in shouldn’t be taxed. If they were, it would only be unfair to the owner since they aren’t making any money from it. For houses that the owner lives in, the tax should be based on how much rent they could get if they rented it out, not how much it cost to build. If we taxed based on building costs, it could really hurt many wealthy families. 

If you look at the big houses of rich families, you’ll see that their rent is almost equal to the total rent from their land. They’ve spent a lot of money over generations on beautiful houses, but compared to what they cost, they aren’t worth much in terms of rent.

Ground-rent is a better thing to tax than house rent. Taxing ground-rent wouldn’t make house rent go up; it would only affect the owner of the ground-rent, who usually charges as much as possible. The amount they can charge depends on how rich the people wanting to rent it are. In big cities, there are more wealthy people competing for land, so that’s where the highest ground-rents are found. A tax on ground-rent wouldn’t change how wealthy these people are, so they probably wouldn’t pay more for the land. It wouldn’t matter much whether the tax was paid by the person living there or the landowner. The more the person living there had to pay,
