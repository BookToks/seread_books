Adam Smith talks about how families manage their own work and products. He says that farming can do better than factories, even when there are limits on selling goods outside. In ancient Egypt and India, the lack of foreign markets was somewhat balanced by rivers that helped transport goods within the country. India was really big, so it had a large market that could support many types of factories. But ancient Egypt was smaller and couldn’t support as many factories.

Bengal, a region in India known for exporting a lot of rice, was actually more famous for making and selling different products than just rice. On the other hand, ancient Egypt, while it did export some products like fine linen, was mostly known for exporting grain. It was a major supplier of grain for the Roman Empire.

In places like China, ancient Egypt, and different parts of India, the rulers made most of their money from taxes on land. This land tax was similar to a tax in Europe called the tithe, where a portion of what was grown on the land (like one-fifth) was paid either in crops or money. Because of this, the rulers paid a lot of attention to farming since their income depended on how well it was doing.

In ancient Greece and Rome, they valued farming more than factories or trade with other countries. However, they didn’t really encourage trade or manufacturing. In some Greek states, foreign trade was completely banned. They thought that jobs in factories could weaken people and make them less fit for military training and exercise, which were really important to them. So, they believed those jobs were only suitable for certain people.
