The Wealth of Nations

The public has to support soldiers. In a country where many people work in factories or make things, a lot of those who fight in wars come from those jobs. So, they need to be supported by everyone while they are serving.

As war has become more complex, it’s not just about one battle anymore. Wars can last for many months and involve different campaigns. Because of this, it’s important for the public to take care of those who fight, at least while they are doing that job. If soldiers had to pay for everything themselves during long wars, it would be way too hard for them. After the second Persian war, Athens mostly had paid soldiers, including both citizens and foreigners, all funded by the state. Similarly, in Rome, soldiers got paid for the time they spent fighting. During the feudal times, lords and their followers eventually got paid in money instead of having to serve in battle themselves.

In a civilized society, the number of people who can fight is much smaller compared to a simple society. Soldiers are supported by the work of those who aren’t soldiers, so the number of soldiers can’t be more than what the rest of the people can afford to support. In ancient Greece, about one in four or five people thought of themselves as soldiers and sometimes went to fight. But in modern Europe, it’s estimated that only about one out of a hundred people can be soldiers without causing problems for the country that pays for them.

The costs of getting an army ready for battle didn’t become significant until much later, after the responsibility of paying for them fell completely on the government. In ancient Greece, learning military skills was a key part of education.
