Adam Smith

The government has never tried to put too much pressure on parts of the empire that don’t have a say in parliament. For example, the islands of Guernsey and Jersey, which can’t fight back against parliament, pay less tax than anywhere else in Great Britain. When parliament tries to tax the colonies, they haven’t asked for anything close to what people in Britain pay. If the colonies’ taxes changed based on the land tax, parliament couldn’t tax them without also taxing its own people, which would mean the colonies would be represented in parliament in a way.

There are many examples of empires where different areas aren’t taxed all at once. Instead, the ruler decides how much each area should pay. In some parts of France, the king sets the taxes and collects them however he wants. In other areas, he asks for a certain amount but lets the local governments decide how to collect it. If Britain taxed the colonies this way, it would be similar to how the king of France deals with the provinces that still have their own local governments.

Even if the colonies wouldn’t have to worry about paying more than their fair share, Britain might worry that they wouldn’t pay enough. Recently, Britain hasn’t had the same control over the colonies that the French king has over his provinces. The local governments in the colonies could easily find excuses to ignore or reject reasonable requests from parliament. For example, if a war breaks out and Britain needs to raise ten million dollars quickly to defend itself, they would need to borrow money. Part of that money would come from a tax that parliament wants to impose.
