they don’t always perfectly represent everyone, but they are closer to doing so. The executive power either can’t bribe them or doesn’t need to because it gets support from the mother country. So, they are usually more influenced by what the people want. 

The councils in the colonies, which are like the house of lords in Great Britain, aren’t made up of people with inherited titles. In some colonies, like three in New England, these councils are chosen by the people’s representatives instead of being appointed by the king. There are no noble families in any of the English colonies. Sure, a person from an old colony family might get more respect than someone new with the same skills and wealth, but they don’t have any special powers that could cause problems for others. 

Before the current issues started, the colony assemblies had both legislative and some executive power. In Connecticut and Rhode Island, they even chose the governor. In other colonies, they picked the tax collectors who worked for them and were directly accountable to them. So, there’s more equality among English colonists than in the mother country. Their ways of doing things are more democratic, especially in three of the New England provinces, which have been more democratic too.

On the other hand, Spain, Portugal, and France have strict governments in their colonies. The power that these governments give to their lower officials is often used harshly because of the distance from the main government. In absolute governments, there’s usually more freedom in the capital than anywhere else. The ruler doesn’t want to mess with justice or hurt the general population. In the capital, the ruler’s presence keeps the lower officials in check, but in faraway places, those officials can act more freely without fear of being reported. 

But the European colonies in America are farther away than any provinces in the biggest empires known before. The way the English colonies are governed might be the only system that could keep people safe in such a distant area. The French colonies, however, have generally been managed with more kindness and fairness than those of Spain and Portugal. This better management is a significant advantage.
