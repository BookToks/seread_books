People in charge often don’t really know what they’re doing. They don’t pay attention to the teacher’s lessons and might not even understand the subjects being taught. Because of this, they usually make poor decisions. Sometimes, they act arrogantly and don’t care about how they treat the teacher. They can unfairly criticize or remove the teacher from their job without a good reason. This makes the teacher feel less respected and can turn them into someone looked down upon in society. The only way the teacher can protect themselves from being treated badly is by having strong support. But this support often comes not from being good at their job, but from being overly obedient to their bosses and putting aside the rights and respect of the group they belong to. Anyone who has spent time at a French university can see the problems that come from this kind of unfair control.

When students are forced to attend a specific college or university, regardless of how good the teachers are, it makes the quality of those teachers less important. If students can only earn their degrees by spending a certain number of years at specific universities, they have to go there, no matter how good the teachers are. These degree requirements are like rules for apprenticeships that help improve education, just like apprenticeship rules help with skills and trades.

Scholarships and financial aid tie certain students to specific colleges, regardless of how good those colleges are. If students with scholarships could choose any college they wanted, it might create some competition between colleges. But if there were rules that stopped students from leaving their college without permission, it would kill that competition.

If each college assigned teachers to students instead of letting students choose their own teachers, it could lead to problems. If a student had a bad teacher or was treated poorly, they wouldn’t be able to switch teachers easily.
