The places that teach people of all ages are mostly about religion. The goal of this teaching isnâ€™t just to make people good citizens now, but to help them get ready for a better life after this one. 

Teachers of these religious ideas can get their money in different ways. They might rely on donations from the people who listen to them, or they could get money from other sources, like land or a salary set by the law. When teachers depend on donations, they usually work harder and care more about what they do. 

New religious teachers often have an edge over older ones because they are more passionate and active. The older teachers might get lazy and stop inspiring the people, which can weaken their religion. Even though these established teachers might be educated and respected, they can lose touch with the everyday people who once looked up to them. 

When a new, bold group challenges the older religion, the established teachers often feel helpless, like a weak nation being attacked by a stronger one. In these situations, they usually ask the government for help to get rid of the challengers, claiming they are causing trouble. This has happened many times in history, like when Catholic leaders asked the government to go after Protestants or when the Church of England targeted other groups. 

Once a religion has been secure for a long time, it often struggles to defend itself against new ideas. Sometimes, the established church might have better knowledge and writing skills, but the new groups are usually better at attracting followers. In England, these new groups have been getting better at gaining support for a long time.
