The Wealth of Nations

Many writings talk about Political Economy, which is about understanding how countries create wealth. These writings mostly follow the ideas of a guy named Mr. Quesnay. Because of this, there isn’t much difference in most of their works. The best explanation of his ideas can be found in a small book by Mr. Mercier de la Riviere, who used to be in charge of Martinique. This book is called The Natural and Essential Order of Political Societies. The people who admire Mr. Quesnay are just as devoted to him as ancient philosophers were to their founders.

A respected author, the Marquis de Mirabeau, said that there have been three major inventions that helped societies stay stable, aside from many other inventions that made them better. The first is writing, which allows people to share laws, contracts, history, and discoveries without changing them. The second is money, which connects different societies. The third is the economical table, which combines the first two and improves them. This is a big discovery for our time, but future generations will benefit from it even more.

In modern Europe, the economy has focused more on factories and trade with other countries than on farming. Other countries have taken a different approach, focusing more on agriculture than on factories and trade. 

In China, farming is valued more than any other job. Here, being a farmer is considered better than being a craftsman, which is the opposite of how it is in most of Europe. In China, everyone dreams of owning a small piece of land, whether they buy it or rent it. Renting land is usually affordable and secure. 

The Chinese don’t think highly of foreign trade. They often dismiss it as “beggarly commerce.” They don’t trade much with other countries, except for Japan, and only allow foreign ships into a couple of their ports. So, foreign trade in China is much more limited than it could be.
