Adam Smith talks about a way people used to raise money called "raising money by circulation." 

In a country where businesses usually make about six to ten percent profit, it was a big deal if someone could make enough money to not only pay back the huge costs of borrowing but also make extra profit. Many big projects were started and kept going for years, but they often relied only on this expensive way of raising money. The people who started these projects probably dreamed of making a lot of money. But when they woke up to reality, they usually didn’t end up with the profits they hoped for.

The method described wasn’t the most common or the most expensive way to raise money. Sometimes, a person in Edinburgh would help someone in London pay a bill by drawing another bill a few days before the first one was due. This new bill was sold in Edinburgh for cash, which was then used to buy bills in London. At the end of a recent war, the exchange rate often made it cost more for Edinburgh, so these transactions could get pretty pricey. 

If this happened four times a year, it could cost the person in Edinburgh a lot of money, around fourteen percent in a year. Other times, they would help pay the first bill by drawing a second bill on a different person in London. This second bill would be given to the first person, who would then get it accepted by a banker in London. The process could repeat multiple times, with each step costing more money. So, by doing this several times a year, it could end up being very expensive to raise money, just like the previous method mentioned.
