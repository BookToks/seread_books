The Wealth of Nations

Sometimes, people like to show off how well their businesses are doing, but it doesn't always match up with how entire countries are doing. 

The price of labor, or how much workers get paid, doesn't always go up and down the same way as the price of food. But that doesn’t mean food prices don’t affect how much workers earn. The pay for labor depends on two main things: how many jobs are available and how much it costs to buy the basic things people need to live. If more jobs are available, or if the population is growing, then workers need to be paid enough to buy what they need. So, if food prices are high, workers would need to be paid even more to afford those prices.

When there’s a lot of food available, more people can be hired because businesses have enough money to pay them. This means employers compete to hire workers, which can drive up wages. On the flip side, when there’s not enough food, there’s less money for businesses to hire people, leading to more people looking for jobs. This competition can lower wages.

For example, in 1740, when food was scarce, many people were willing to work for very little just to get by. But in the years that followed, when there was plenty of food, it became harder for employers to find workers. When food is expensive, it usually means fewer jobs, which lowers wages. But when food is cheap, more jobs are created, which can raise wages. Overall, these ups and downs tend to balance each other out, which is why wages are usually more stable than food prices.
