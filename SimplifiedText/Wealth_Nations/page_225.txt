The Wealth of Nations is split into three parts, and each part has its own job.

The first part is for things that people use right away, and it doesn’t make any money. This includes food, clothes, and furniture that people have bought but haven’t used up yet. All the houses in a country also belong to this part. If someone buys a house to live in, it stops being a way to make money for them. A house doesn’t give any income to the person living in it, just like clothes and furniture don’t. They are useful, but they cost money instead of making it. If someone rents a house, the rent comes from money they earn from work, investments, or land. So, while a house can make money for its owner, it doesn’t help the community make more money. Clothes and furniture can sometimes earn money for individuals, like when people rent out costumes for parties or furniture for events. But the money made from these things always comes from somewhere else. 

When it comes to things people use, houses take the longest to wear out. Clothes can last a few years, furniture can last many decades, but a well-built house can last for centuries. Even though houses last a long time, they are still part of what people use right away.

The second part of the overall stock is called fixed capital. This part makes money without changing ownership. It mainly includes four main things.
