The Wealth of Nations

People often choose jobs that don’t pay well because they like them. This means there are more workers than there are good jobs, so many of them struggle to make enough money to live comfortably. The stuff they produce usually sells for very little, which means they can barely afford to get by.

Jobs that are unpleasant or looked down upon can also affect how much money people make. For example, a bartender who has to deal with rude customers isn’t doing a fun job, but running a bar can still make a lot of money compared to other jobs.

Next, how much workers get paid depends on how easy or hard it is to learn their job. If a company buys an expensive machine, it needs to work a lot before it breaks down to make back the money spent on it, plus some profit. A person who spends a lot of time and effort learning a skilled job is like that machine. The work they do should help them earn back what they spent on their education, plus some extra money, in a reasonable amount of time, just like the machine.

The difference in pay between skilled workers and regular workers comes from this idea.

In Europe, jobs like mechanics and manufacturers are seen as skilled work, while farm jobs are considered common work. It seems like skilled jobs are more complicated, but that’s not always true. I’ll explain more about this later. Because of this, European laws require people to go through an apprenticeship to learn skilled jobs, but anyone can do common jobs. During the apprenticeship, the apprentice works for their master, but they often need support from their family for food and clothes. Sometimes, money is paid to the master for teaching the apprentice. If someone can’t pay, they might have to work longer or agree to more years of training, which isn’t always good for the master.
