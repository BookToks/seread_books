The Wealth of Nations

In Scotland, you can grow really good grapes using special tools like glasses and hot-beds, and you can make decent wine from them. But it costs about thirty times more to make wine in Scotland than to buy equally good wine from other countries. So, would it make sense to ban all foreign wines just to support making wine in Scotland? It would be silly to spend so much more money and effort to make something that could be bought cheaper from elsewhere.

Even if a country has some advantages over another, it doesn't really matter. If one country can make something better or cheaper, it’s smarter for the other country to just buy it instead of trying to make it themselves. This is similar to how two different workers in different jobs find it better to buy from each other rather than trying to do everything themselves.

Merchants and manufacturers benefit the most from keeping the market closed to foreign goods. For example, banning foreign cattle and salt, along with high taxes on foreign grains, helps farmers in Britain, but it helps merchants and manufacturers even more. It's easier to move manufactured goods from one place to another than it is to transport things like corn or cattle. That’s why foreign trade mainly focuses on moving manufactured items.

If foreign manufactured goods were allowed in freely, some local businesses might struggle or even fail, forcing workers to find new jobs. However, allowing foreign raw materials like crops wouldn’t hurt the farming industry in the same way. 

For instance, if foreign cattle could come in freely, not many would actually be imported, so it wouldn’t really change the cattle business in Britain much. Transporting live cattle is probably one of the most expensive things to do.
