The Wealth of Nations

When Columbus didn't find anything special in the animals or plants of the new lands he discovered, he looked for minerals instead. He thought he had found something great in the gold he saw. The locals wore small pieces of gold as decorations, and they told him they often found it in the streams coming down from the mountains. This made him believe that the mountains were full of gold. So, he described St. Domingo as a place rich in gold, which made it seem like a huge treasure for Spain.

When Columbus returned from his first trip, he was celebrated by the kings of Castile and Aragon. They paraded the things he found in the new lands. The only valuable items were some gold jewelry and a few bales of cotton. The rest were just interesting things like giant reeds, beautiful birds, and stuffed skins of big animals. There were also a few local people who looked very different, which made the whole display even more fascinating.

Because of what Columbus said, the council of Castile decided to take control of these lands, believing the locals couldn't defend themselves. They thought they were helping by trying to convert the natives to Christianity, but really, they were mostly motivated by the hope of finding gold. Columbus suggested that half of any gold and silver found should go to the crown, and the council agreed.

At first, it was easy for the explorers to get gold by taking it from the defenseless locals, so paying taxes on it wasn't hard. But after a few years, when the locals had nothing left, they had to start digging in the mines to find more gold. This made it impossible to keep paying those taxes, and the strict demands for money led to big problems.
