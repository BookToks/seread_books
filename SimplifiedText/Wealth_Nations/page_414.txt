Adam Smith talks about how manufacturers want to sell their goods, but sometimes the market gets too full. When this happens, giving them money for exporting their extra goods helps keep prices up at home. This method is their favorite because it works well.

I've seen some businesses agree to pay each other to help export a certain amount of their products. This plan worked so well that it more than doubled their prices at home, even though they were making a lot more products. The situation with corn was different because the price actually went down.

Sometimes, there have been rewards for producing certain goods, like the bounties for fishing herring and whales. These rewards might make the goods cheaper at home, but they also have similar effects as export bounties. They use money to bring goods to market, but the prices don’t always cover the costs.

Even though these fishing bounties don’t really help the country’s wealth, they might help with defense by increasing the number of sailors and ships. It’s argued that this can be cheaper than maintaining a big navy, similar to how a standing army works.

However, I think there are reasons to believe that one of these bounties was a bad idea. 

First, the bounty for herring fishing seems way too high. From 1771 to 1781, the bounty was thirty shillings for each ton of herring caught. Over those eleven years, Scottish herring fishers caught 378,347 barrels. The fish caught and preserved at sea are called sea-sticks. To make them sellable, they need to be repacked with more salt.
