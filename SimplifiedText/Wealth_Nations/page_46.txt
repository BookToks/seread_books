Adam Smith talks about how the value of things we buy is affected by different factors. When someone works to create or gather something, like food, they don’t just get paid for their effort. They also have to consider the costs of the materials they used and the profits that the person who owns the business makes.

Once land becomes private property, the owners want to make money from it, even if they didn’t do any work to improve it. They charge rent for things that grow naturally, like trees and grass. When people want to gather these things, they have to pay the landowner a fee and give up part of what they collect. This fee is called rent, and it’s a big part of the price of many products.

The real value of anything we buy is based on how much work it takes to get it. The value isn’t just about the work put in, but also includes the rent and profits involved. In every society, the price of things usually breaks down into these three parts: rent, labor, and profit. 

For example, when we buy corn, part of the price goes to the landowner as rent, part goes to the workers who grew it, and part is profit for the farmer. These three parts make up the total price of corn. Some people might think there’s another part needed to cover the costs of tools or animals used in farming, like a horse. But the price of that horse also includes rent, labor, and profit. So, in the end, whether it’s corn or flour, the price always comes down to those same three parts: rent, labor, and profit.
