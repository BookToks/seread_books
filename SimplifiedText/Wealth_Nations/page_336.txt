Adam Smith

In places where rich people can only spend their money on taking care of others, they usually run out of money. They don’t often try to help more people than they can afford. But in places where they can spend a lot on themselves, they often go overboard because they care a lot about how they look and their own comfort. In countries where business is important, money rarely stays in the same family for long, even with strict laws trying to stop that. But in simpler societies, like those with shepherds, wealth often stays in families without any laws because their property is used up quickly.

A big change that helped everyone happened because of two groups of people who didn’t mean to help anyone. The wealthy landowners were just trying to show off. The merchants and workers, who were a bit more sensible, were only looking out for their own interests and trying to make money wherever they could. Neither group realized that their actions were slowly causing a major change.

In many parts of Europe, city businesses and factories didn’t just happen; they actually caused improvements in the countryside. However, this way of growing is slow and uncertain. If you look at how slowly European countries grow compared to our North American colonies, you’ll see a big difference. In Europe, it might take five hundred years for the population to double, but in some North American colonies, it can double in just twenty or twenty-five years.

In Europe, laws that keep big estates from being divided make it hard for small landowners to grow. But a small landowner who knows their land well usually cares for it a lot. They enjoy taking care of it and making it look nice, which makes them hardworking, smart, and successful. These same laws also keep a lot of land off the market, so there are always more people wanting to buy land than there is land available.
