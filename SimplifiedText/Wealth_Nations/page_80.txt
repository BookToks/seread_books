High wages and high profits usually don’t happen at the same time, except in new colonies. In a new colony, there’s often more land than people and not enough resources to use all the land. They focus on farming the best land, like areas near the coast or rivers. This land can sometimes be bought for less than it’s worth, which means that the money spent on improving it can make a lot of profit. Because of this, the people working there can earn good wages.

As the colony grows, the profits start to go down. Once all the best land is taken, it’s harder to make money from the less fertile land. Because of this, the interest rates on loans in these colonies have dropped over time. As people become richer and the population grows, the interest on money decreases. However, wages don’t go down with profits. As more resources are available, the need for workers increases, even if profits are lower. 

In busy countries, just like hardworking individuals, having a lot of resources, even if they don’t make much profit, usually grows faster than having a small amount of resources that make a lot of profit. There’s a saying that money makes money. Once you have a little, it’s often easier to get more. The hard part is getting that first bit. The link between having more resources and needing more workers has been touched on, but it will be explained more later when talking about how resources build up.

Sometimes, gaining new land or starting new types of businesses can increase profits and interest rates, even in a country that’s already getting richer. When new opportunities come up, the available resources aren’t enough for everyone, so they go to the areas that can make the most money. Some resources that were used for other businesses are redirected to these new opportunities.
