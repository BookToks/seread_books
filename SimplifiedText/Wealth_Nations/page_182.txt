Adam Smith talks about how gold and silver are used in Europe. He explains that no matter how much gold and silver is brought into a country each year, there will come a time when the amount people use will match the amount being brought in. As more gold and silver is available, people start using it more, which makes its value go down. When people use more of it, the amount they have doesn't matter as much, so they care less about it. Eventually, the amount used each year will equal the amount brought in, as long as the imports don’t keep going up.

If the amount of gold and silver coming in starts to go down after it matches what people use, people might still use more than what is coming in for a while. This means the total amount of gold and silver might slowly decrease, and its value could slowly go up until the imports stabilize again. Then, the amount people use will adjust to match what is being imported.

Some people think the value of silver is still going down. They believe that as Europe gets richer and the amount of gold and silver increases, its value goes down too. The rising prices of things from the land might make them think this is true.

But I’ve tried to explain that the increase in gold and silver from a richer country doesn’t actually lower its value. Gold and silver go to wealthy countries because they are worth more there, not because they are cheaper. People pay more for them in rich places, and when that stops being true, they won’t go there anymore.

Except for crops and vegetables grown by people, most other things like animals, food, and natural resources tend to get more expensive as society gets richer. I’ve already shown this. So, even if these things cost more silver than before, it doesn’t mean that silver is losing its value.
