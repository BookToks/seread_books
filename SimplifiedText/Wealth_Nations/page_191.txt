The Wealth of Nations

Cows and goats get some of their food from milk and buttermilk, and they find the rest in nearby fields without causing much trouble. If there are fewer small farms, then the amount of this kind of food, which is cheap to produce, will definitely go down. This means the price will go up faster than it would have otherwise. Eventually, the price will rise to the highest point it can reach, which is enough to cover the cost of growing the food for the animals.

Dairy farming, like raising pigs and chickens, is done to save money. The cows on the farm produce more milk than the farmer's family can use or than they need for raising calves. They produce the most milk at certain times of the year. However, milk goes bad quickly, especially in warm weather, where it can spoil in less than a day. The farmer can turn some of the milk into fresh butter to keep it for a week, salt butter to keep it for a year, and cheese to store it for several years. Some of this is kept for the farmer's family, and the rest is sold to get the best price. If prices are really low, the farmer might not take good care of the dairy and could even keep it in a messy kitchen, like many farmers in Scotland did 30 or 40 years ago.

As the demand for meat goes up and there are fewer animals that can be fed cheaply, the price of dairy products also rises. This price increase is connected to the price of meat and the cost of feeding cattle. Higher prices mean farmers can afford to spend more time and effort on their dairy, making it cleaner and better quality. Eventually, the price gets so high that it becomes worth it to use some of the best land just for raising cattle for dairy. Once the price reaches this point, it won't go down easily.
