The Wealth of Nations

In the past, businesses needed only a little money to start, but they made a lot of profit. Back then, interest rates were at least ten percent, which means they were making enough money to pay that back. Nowadays, in the better parts of Europe, interest rates are usually lower, around six percent or even as low as two percent in some places. Rich countries make more money from investments than poor countries, but they also have more money to invest. However, the profits compared to the amount invested are usually smaller.

When we look at how much stuff is produced each year, the amount that goes back into the business is much higher in rich countries than in poor ones. This amount is also a bigger part of what people earn from rent or profits. The money used to support workers is much greater in rich countries, and it tends to go more towards productive jobs rather than unproductive ones.

The way money is divided up in a country affects how hardworking or lazy people are. Today, we work harder than our ancestors did because there’s more money available to support jobs compared to money that supports laziness. In the past, people were less motivated to work because there weren’t enough rewards for doing so. There’s a saying that it’s better to play for free than to work for free. 

In towns focused on trade and manufacturing, where people earn money through jobs, they tend to be hardworking and successful, like in many English and Dutch towns. But in places that rely on a royal court and where people mostly spend money, like Rome and Versailles, people are often lazy and poor. In France, aside from Rouen and Bordeaux, many towns don’t have much trade or industry. The people there often rely on the money spent by court members and lawyers, which keeps them idle and struggling. Rouen and Bordeaux are successful mainly because of their location.
