Adam Smith talks about how the amount of metals like gold and silver in different countries can change. This change depends on two main things: how much those metals can be found in mines and how wealthy a country is.

When a country has a lot of money and resources, it can buy more metals. So, if a country is doing well, the prices of these metals might go up. But if the country is struggling, the prices could go down. Countries with more workers and food can spend more on metals compared to those that have less to spare.

The amount of metals in a country also depends on how rich or poor the mines are. If the mines are producing a lot, the prices might drop, but if the mines are not doing well, prices could go up. 

However, the success of the mines doesn’t always relate to how well a country is doing overall. As more people explore the world, they might find new mines, which could be better than the old ones. But finding new mines is really uncertain. No one can guarantee that new mines will be found or that they will be valuable. 

Over time, it’s possible that new mines could be discovered that are even better than the ones we know now. But it’s also possible that the best mines we have could turn out to be less productive than the ones we used to have.
