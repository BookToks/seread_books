CHAPTER II

ABOUT RESTRICTIONS ON IMPORTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES

When a country makes it hard to bring in goods from other countries that can be made at home, it helps local businesses. This is done by charging high taxes or completely banning those goods. For example, if Great Britain stops importing live cattle or salted food, it helps local farmers sell more meat. Similarly, high taxes on imported corn protect local corn growers. Banning foreign wool also helps wool manufacturers in Britain. Even though the silk industry uses foreign materials, it has recently gained similar protections. The linen industry is still working towards this goal. Many other types of manufacturing in Great Britain have also gained a strong position against competition from other countries. There are many goods that Britain doesn’t allow in, either completely or under certain rules, which might surprise people who don’t know the customs laws well.

Having this kind of protection for local markets often boosts the specific industries that benefit from it. It can lead to more workers and resources being used in those areas than would normally happen. However, it’s not clear if this actually helps the overall economy or if it’s the best way to use resources. The total amount of work that can be done in a society is limited by how much money and resources that society has. The number of workers a business can hire depends on how much money it has, and the same goes for all businesses in a large society. No trade rules can make a society’s productivity exceed what its resources can support. They can only shift some of that productivity to different areas, and it’s uncertain if this new direction will be better.
