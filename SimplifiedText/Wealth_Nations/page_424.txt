Adam Smith talks about how trade works in towns. He says that farmers were pushed to sell their corn directly to people or to those who transport it. This made them act like both farmers and corn sellers. But at the same time, manufacturers were often not allowed to sell their own products directly to customers. This was meant to help the country by making corn cheaper, but it wasn't always clear how that would happen. It also aimed to protect shopkeepers, who might lose business if manufacturers could sell directly.

Even if manufacturers could sell their own goods, they wouldn't be able to sell them cheaper than regular shopkeepers. If they opened a shop, they would have to take money away from their manufacturing to do it. To compete, they would need to charge more for their goods. For example, if the usual profit for both manufacturing and selling in a shop was ten percent, they would have to charge twenty percent for their goods in their shop. They had to price their items based on what they could sell them to a shopkeeper for. If they priced them too low, they would lose money from their manufacturing. And if they sold them for less than what a shopkeeper would charge, they would lose money from their shop. So, even though it seemed like they could make money twice on the same item, they really only made one profit overall. If they earned less than expected, they would lose money and not do as well as their neighbors.

What manufacturers couldn't do, farmers were expected to do. Farmers had to split their money between two jobs: keeping some in storage to meet market demands and using the rest to grow their crops. But they couldn't afford to keep their crops in storage for less than what was usually made in selling goods, just like they couldn't farm for less than the usual farming profits.
