Adam Smith talks about how a system called the bounty affects the price of corn. The bounty is meant to help farmers, especially during tough times when there isn’t much corn. But when there’s a lot of corn, the bounty can make prices go up, which means it might not help as much as it should during the bad years.

Some people think the bounty helps farmers in two ways. First, it opens up more places to sell their corn, which makes more people want to buy it. This could lead to farmers growing more corn. Second, it helps farmers get a better price for their corn than they would without the bounty. They believe that over many years, this could lead to more corn being produced, which might lower prices in the long run.

However, I think that any extra sales to other countries because of the bounty actually hurt the local market. Every bushel of corn that gets sold to another country because of the bounty would have stayed in the local market, which would have helped lower prices and increased how much corn people can buy. 

The bounty also means that people have to pay two kinds of taxes. First, they pay taxes to fund the bounty itself. Second, they pay more for corn because of the higher prices caused by the bounty. Since everyone buys corn, this second tax affects everyone. If we say that the bounty raises the price of corn by just a little bit, people still end up paying more for every quarter of corn they buy, on top of the tax for the bounty.
