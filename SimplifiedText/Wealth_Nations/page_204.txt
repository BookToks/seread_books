Adam Smith

The high price of corn over the last ten or twelve years can mostly be explained by bad weather, not because silver is losing its value. So, the idea that silver is always getting cheaper doesn’t seem to be based on good facts, whether we look at corn prices or other foods.

It might be said that the same amount of silver can buy less food now than it could in some parts of the last century. But figuring out if this is because food prices have gone up or if silver has gone down in value doesn’t really help someone who only has a set amount of silver to spend or a fixed income. Knowing this difference won’t help them buy things for less, but it might still be useful in some ways.

For the public, it could show that the country is doing well. If the rise in food prices is just because silver is worth less, it points to the fact that the American mines are producing a lot of silver. The real wealth of the country comes from what we grow and make, and this can still be going down, like in Portugal and Poland, or going up, like in most of Europe. But if food prices are rising because the land is getting more valuable or better at producing crops, it shows that the country is improving. The land is the biggest and most important part of a country’s wealth, so it’s good for people to see clear proof that this part of wealth is increasing.

It can also help the public by adjusting how much some workers get paid. If food prices are rising because silver is worth less, then the pay for these workers should go up too, as long as their pay wasn’t already too high. If it doesn’t go up, they will actually be earning less. But if the rise in prices is because the land is becoming more valuable due to better farming, then that’s a different story.
