The next two accounts are included to explain and support what is mentioned in the fifth chapter of the fourth book about the Tonnage Bounty for the Whit-herring Fishery. You can trust that both accounts are accurate.

The first account shows the number of fishing boats (called Busses) from Scotland over eleven years. It lists how many empty barrels were taken out and how many barrels of herrings were caught. It also shows the average bounty paid for each barrel of sea-sticks and each fully packed barrel.

Here are the details:

In 1771, there were 29 boats that took out 5,948 empty barrels and caught 2,832 barrels of herrings. The bounty paid was £2,885.

In 1772, 168 boats took out 41,316 empty barrels and caught 22,237 barrels of herrings, with a bounty of £11,055.

In 1773, 190 boats took out 42,333 empty barrels and caught 42,055 barrels of herrings, getting a bounty of £12,510.

In 1774, 240 boats took out 59,303 empty barrels and caught 56,365 barrels of herrings, with a bounty of £26,932.

In 1775, 275 boats took out 69,144 empty barrels and caught 52,879 barrels of herrings, getting a bounty of £19,315.

In 1776, 294 boats took out 76,329 empty barrels and caught 51,863 barrels of herrings, with a bounty of £21,290.

In 1777, 240 boats took out 62,679 empty barrels and caught 43,313 barrels of herrings, getting a bounty of £17,592.

In 1778, 220 boats took out 56,390 empty barrels and caught 40,958 barrels of herrings, with a bounty of £16,316.

In 1779, 206 boats took out 55,194 empty barrels and caught 29,367 barrels of herrings, getting a bounty of £15,287.

In 1780, 181 boats took out 48,315 empty barrels and caught 19,885 barrels of herrings, with a bounty of £13,445.

In 1781, 135 boats took out 33,992 empty barrels and caught 16,593 barrels of herrings, getting a bounty of £9,613.

In total, there were 2,186 boats that took out 550,943 empty barrels and caught 378,347 barrels of herrings, with a total bounty of £165,463.

For sea-sticks, the bounty for each barrel is about £0.08. However, since a barrel of sea-sticks is considered two-thirds of a fully packed barrel, we need to deduct one-third, which brings the bounty to about £0.12.

If the herrings are exported, there’s an extra payment of £0.02. So, the total bounty paid by the government for each barrel is about £0.14.

If we add the cost of salt used for curing each barrel, which is about one and a quarter bushels at £10 per bushel, we can see the total costs involved.
