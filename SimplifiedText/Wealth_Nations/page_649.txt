The Wealth of Nations talks about how people who want to work in important jobs should prove they know what they’re doing. Instead of just paying teachers to be lazy, the government should make sure everyone has to learn and pass tests before they can get these jobs. If the government pushes people to learn, they won’t have to worry about finding good teachers because people will seek out the best ones themselves. Learning is really important because it helps people avoid getting caught up in crazy ideas and superstitions. If the smart people are safe from these ideas, then regular folks will be less affected too.

Another way to help is by having fun public events. The government should let anyone who wants to create entertainment, like art, music, or plays, do so freely. This would help lift people’s spirits and reduce the sadness that often leads to superstitions and wild beliefs. People who promote these crazy ideas usually hate public entertainment because it makes people happy and distracts them from their fears. Shows and performances can even make fun of those crazy ideas, which is why the people who promote them dislike them so much.

In a place where the law treats all religions equally, teachers wouldn’t need to rely on the government for their jobs. The government would just need to make sure everyone gets along and doesn’t hurt each other. But in places where one religion is favored, the government has to keep a close eye on the teachers of that religion to stay safe. The leaders can’t relax unless they have some control over the main teachers of that religion. The leaders of any established church work together and look out for their own interests.
