Adam Smith talks about how people make money and what they need to spend to keep their businesses running. 

When someone works, they need to earn enough money to cover their own living costs and the costs of materials, tools, and paying their workers. If they don’t make enough money from selling their products to cover these costs, then they aren’t really making a profit. 

Manufacturing profits are different from land rent. Land rent is money that comes after paying all the costs, while profits from manufacturing just cover the expenses without creating extra value. 

For farmers, their work not only covers their costs but also creates new value, which is the rent that goes to the landowner. This means farming is a productive expense. 

On the other hand, money spent on manufacturing doesn’t create new value; it just keeps its own value alive. The profits from this kind of work only pay back what the employer spent while waiting for returns. 

When workers make things, like lace from flax, they can increase the value of that flax a lot. For example, they might turn a small amount of flax worth a penny into lace worth £30. But even though it looks like they’ve increased the value a lot, they haven’t added any real value to everything produced in a year. 

The worker spends two years making that lace, and the £30 they earn is just enough to cover what they needed to live during that time. The value they add each day just replaces what they consumed, so it doesn’t really increase the overall value of everything produced.
