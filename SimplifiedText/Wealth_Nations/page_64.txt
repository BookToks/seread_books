Marriage is encouraged in China, but not because having kids is profitable. Instead, it's because people can get rid of them easily. In big cities, babies are often left out on the streets or even drowned like unwanted puppies. Some people even make a living by doing this terrible thing.

However, China isn’t falling apart. Its cities are still full of people, and the farmland is still being used. The same amount of work needs to be done every year, so the money for that work doesn’t really go down. The poorest workers, even though they don’t have much to eat, somehow manage to keep having kids to maintain their numbers.

But things would be different in a place where the money for supporting workers is really going down. Each year, there would be fewer jobs for workers than the year before. People from higher classes, who can’t find jobs in their own fields, would be forced to look for work in the lowest jobs. This would flood the lowest job market with too many workers, making it super competitive. Wages would drop to the point where workers could barely survive. Many wouldn’t even find jobs at these low wages and would either starve or have to beg or do terrible things to survive. 

This kind of situation would lead to hunger, death, and suffering among the poorest people, which would then spread to the richer classes until the population shrank to a level that could be supported by the remaining resources. This is kind of what’s happening now in Bengal and some other English colonies in the East Indies. 

In a rich country where many people used to live but now a lot die from hunger every year, it shows that the money meant to help the poor workers is running out fast. The difference between how the British government treats North America and how the trading company controls the East Indies shows just how different those places are.
