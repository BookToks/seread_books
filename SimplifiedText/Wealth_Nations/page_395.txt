The Wealth of Nations

People say that the Portuguese buy more of our stuff than the French do, so we should support them more. Since they buy from us, we should buy from them too. This idea comes from small-time sellers who only want to help their own customers. But a smart businessperson buys their products where they are the cheapest and best, without worrying about these small interests.

Because of ideas like this, countries have been taught to think that they should make their neighbors poor. Each country looks at others' success with jealousy, thinking that if another country gains something, it means they lose something. Trade, which should bring countries together like friends, has turned into a source of conflict and anger. The selfish desires of kings and leaders have caused problems in Europe, but so has the greed of merchants and manufacturers. While the bad actions of rulers have been a long-standing issue, the greedy behavior of merchants can often be stopped from bothering anyone but themselves.

It's clear that the idea of monopoly started this way of thinking. The people who came up with it weren’t fools, but those who believed it might have been. In every country, it's always better for most people to buy what they need from whoever sells it for the lowest price. This is so obvious that it seems silly to even argue about it. The only reason it gets questioned is because of the tricky arguments from merchants and manufacturers who confuse everyone. Their interests are different from what most people want. Just like a group of workers wants to keep others from hiring anyone but them, merchants and manufacturers want to keep the market to themselves. That’s why in Great Britain and many other European countries, there are high taxes on goods brought in by foreign sellers. This is also why there are strict rules against foreign products that could compete with local ones.
