The Wealth of Nations

At any time, a worker doesn’t really add to the total value of what the land produces in a year. The stuff they use up is equal to what they create. Most workers in low-paying jobs are really poor, which shows that they don’t earn more than what they need to live. 

But farmers and country workers are different. The money that landlords make is usually more than what it costs to take care of the workers and their employers. 

People who work in factories, shops, and businesses can only increase their wealth by saving money. This means they have to give up some of what they could spend on themselves. If they don’t save some of their earnings, they can’t help their society get richer. 

On the other hand, farmers and country workers can use all their earnings for themselves and still help their society get richer. They produce extra goods that increase the wealth of their community. Countries like France and England, which have many landowners and farmers, can become wealthy through both hard work and enjoying life. 

In contrast, countries like Holland and Hamburg, which mainly have merchants and factory workers, can only get rich by saving money and cutting back on spending. Because of this difference, the people in these countries also have different attitudes. In the first type of country, people tend to be generous, friendly, and enjoy socializing. In the second type, people can be more stingy, selfish, and less interested in having fun with others. 

The group of workers in factories and shops relies on the farmers and landowners for their survival. The farmers and landowners provide the materials and food that these workers need. In the end, the farmers and landowners pay the wages of all the workers.
