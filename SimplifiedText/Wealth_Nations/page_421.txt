The Wealth of Nations

When people think about buying corn, they might want to buy a lot of it. But how it's made makes it hard for them to actually buy enough. In every country, corn is the most consumed food, so a lot of effort goes into growing it compared to anything else. 

When corn is harvested, it usually ends up in the hands of many different owners, unlike other products that might be made by a few manufacturers in one place. These owners are spread out all over the country. They either sell directly to people nearby or to other sellers who then sell to consumers. Because there are so many sellers of corn, like farmers and bakers, they can’t easily team up to control prices. 

If there’s a year when corn is hard to find, and one seller has more corn than they can sell at the current price, they won’t keep the price high and lose money. Instead, they will lower the price to sell their corn before the new harvest comes in. All sellers will think the same way, and they will adjust their prices based on how much corn is available.

If you look at the history of food shortages and famines in Europe over the last few centuries, you’ll see that shortages usually happen because there’s not enough corn, not because sellers are working together to raise prices. Most of the time, the shortages are caused by bad weather or sometimes by the destruction from wars. Famines usually happen when the government tries to fix the problem in the wrong way.

In a large area where corn is grown and people can trade freely, even when the weather is really bad, there shouldn’t be a famine. Even a small harvest can feed the same number of people as a bigger harvest if it’s managed carefully. The worst weather can still provide enough food if people are smart about how they use it.
