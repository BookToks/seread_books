Adam Smith

The church owned land before 1575, and it only pays taxes based on a third of its value.

In Silesia, land owned by nobles pays three percent more in taxes than land owned by regular people. The king of Prussia probably thought that the extra benefits for nobles would make up for the higher tax, while the lower tax for regular people would make their situation a bit better. In other places, like Sardinia and some parts of France, the tax system makes things worse. The tax only hits the land owned by regular people, while nobles don’t have to pay it.

Even if a land tax starts off fair, it will likely become unfair over time. To keep it fair, the government would need to constantly check how much each farm is producing and its condition. Some governments, like those in Prussia, Bohemia, Sardinia, and Milan, try to do this, but it’s really hard and probably won’t last long. If they keep it up, it could cause more problems than it solves for the people paying taxes.

In 1666, Montauban was taxed based on a detailed survey. But by 1727, that tax system became unfair. To fix this, the government decided to add an extra tax of 120,000 livres on everyone. This extra tax was based on the old system, but it only affected areas that were paying less than they should. It was used to help areas that were paying too much. For example, if one area should pay 900 livres and another should pay 1,100 livres, but both were taxed at 1,000 livres before, the new tax would raise both to 1,100 livres. However, the extra tax would only be taken from the area that was under-taxed, and the area that was over-taxed would only pay 900 livres. The government doesn’t gain or lose from this extra tax; it just redistributes the burden.
