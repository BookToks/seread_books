The strict rules about wool don’t seem to have changed how much wool is produced each year, even though they might have affected the quality more than the amount. The wool growers have probably been hurt a bit, but not as much as people thought they would be.

These points don’t really justify completely banning the export of wool, but they do support putting a decent tax on it. Hurting one group of people just to help another isn’t fair. The ban does hurt wool growers a bit just to help manufacturers.

Everyone in the country should help support the government. A tax of five or ten shillings on every unit of wool exported could bring in a lot of money for the government. This tax would hurt wool growers less than a total ban because it wouldn’t drop the price of wool as much. It would still help manufacturers because they would pay less than foreign manufacturers, plus they wouldn’t have to pay shipping costs. It’s hard to think of a tax that could bring in good money for the government while bothering people less.

Even with all the penalties, the ban on exporting wool doesn’t stop it from happening. Wool is still exported a lot. The big price difference between local and foreign markets makes smuggling tempting, and no amount of law enforcement can stop it. The only one who benefits from this illegal export is the smuggler. A legal export with a tax could help the government earn money and avoid putting heavier taxes on everyone else.

The export of certain types of clay needed for cleaning wool has similar penalties to those for wool. Even tobacco-pipe clay, which is known to be important, has faced similar restrictions.
