Portugal has a specific way of doing things when it comes to two main areas in Brazil, Pernambucco and Marannon. Other countries, instead of having one exclusive trading company, have limited all trade from their colonies to a certain port in their home country. Ships could only leave that port either in a group at a set time or alone if they had a special permit, which usually cost a lot of money. 

This system allowed traders from the home country to do business in the colonies, as long as they followed the rules about where and when to trade. However, since all the different merchants teamed up to send out these licensed ships, they ended up working together like they were part of an exclusive company. This meant that the profits for these merchants were really high and unfair. The colonies didn’t get enough supplies and had to pay a lot for what they bought while selling their own products for very little. 

For a long time, Spain followed this same approach, which made European goods super expensive in the Spanish West Indies. For example, in Quito, a pound of iron cost around 4s:6d, and a pound of steel was about 6s:9d. The colonies mainly traded their own products to buy European goods. So, the more they spent on European stuff, the less they got for their own goods, meaning high prices for one meant low prices for the other. 

Portugal’s approach is similar to Spain’s old way of dealing with its colonies, except for Pernambucco and Marannon, where things have gotten even worse recently. Other countries let their colonies trade freely, allowing anyone from the home country to trade from various ports without needing special licenses, just the usual customs paperwork. This makes it hard for traders to team up and keep prices high because there are so many of them competing with each other. 

With this kind of open trading, colonies can sell their products and buy European goods at fair prices. Since the Plymouth company ended, England has always had this kind of trading policy, and France has done the same since their Mississippi company ended. So, while the profits from trade between France, England, and their colonies are higher, they are still more reasonable compared to the other systems.
