The Wealth of Nations talks about a small group of wealthy people who want to protect their stuff and support their leader. They do this so their leader can keep their property safe and maintain their power. The government is set up to protect the rich from the poor, or to defend those who have things against those who don’t have anything.

For a long time, the leader made money from the justice system instead of spending it. People who wanted justice were usually ready to pay for it, and they often gave gifts when they asked for help. Once the leader's power was strong, if someone was found guilty, they had to pay the person they harmed and also pay a fine to the leader. This was because they caused trouble and disturbed the peace of the king.

In places like Asia and Europe, where leaders came from tribes that took over the Roman Empire, the justice system was a big way for leaders and local chiefs to make money. At first, the leaders handled justice themselves, but later they let others, like judges, do it for them. These judges still had to report back to the leaders about the money they made from their work. 

Back in the time of King Henry II, judges traveled around to collect money for the king. The justice system not only brought in money for the king but was also a way for him to gain more power.

This way of using justice to make money led to a lot of unfairness. If someone asked for justice and brought a big gift, they might get better results than someone who only brought a small gift. Sometimes, justice was delayed so that the person could give more gifts. Also, the fines for the person being accused could make it more likely for them to be found guilty, even if they weren’t in the wrong.
