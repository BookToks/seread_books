The Wealth of Nations

Hiring the wrong person is just as rude as it is unfair.

Long apprenticeships don’t guarantee that bad work won’t be sold to the public. When that happens, it’s usually because of cheating, not because the person can’t do the job. We need different rules to stop this from happening. Marks on silver and stamps on cloth give buyers more confidence than any apprenticeship law. People check for these marks but rarely ask if the worker has done a seven-year apprenticeship.

Long apprenticeships don’t help young people become hard workers. A worker who gets paid for each piece they make is more likely to work hard because they benefit from it. An apprentice, on the other hand, often doesn’t work hard because they don’t see any immediate rewards. In lower-level jobs, the benefits come from the work itself. Those who can enjoy the rewards sooner are more likely to appreciate work and develop a good work ethic. A young person usually doesn’t want to work if they don’t see any benefits for a long time. Boys who are sent to apprenticeships through charities often have to work longer than usual and usually end up being lazy and unproductive.

Apprenticeships didn’t exist in ancient times. The responsibilities between a master and an apprentice are important in today’s laws. Roman law doesn’t mention them at all. I don’t know any Greek or Latin word that means what we think of when we say apprentice—a person who works for a master in a specific trade for a set number of years while learning that trade.

Long apprenticeships aren’t needed. Even complex jobs like making clocks and watches don’t require a long time to learn. The original designs of these machines took a lot of thought and time, and they’re amazing examples of human creativity. But once these machines are invented and understood, teaching a young person how to use the tools and build the machines shouldn’t take more than a few weeks, or maybe just a few days.
