Where banks are allowed to make very small notes, it can lead to a lot of people who shouldn't be bankers trying to be one. Someone who would never get a loan for £5 or even £1 will find it easy to get a note for just sixpence. But when these small-time bankers go bankrupt, it can really hurt a lot of poor people who accepted their notes as payment.

It might be better if banks didn’t issue notes for anything less than £5. Then, paper money would mostly just be used between businesses, like it is in London, where they don’t make notes under £10. In most of the country, £5 can buy only about half of what it used to, but people still treat it seriously and don’t spend it all at once, just like they do with £10 in expensive London.

In places where paper money is mostly used between businesses, like London, there is still plenty of gold and silver. But where it’s used a lot between businesses and regular people, like in Scotland and even more in North America, gold and silver almost disappear because people use paper money for everything. Stopping the use of ten and five shilling notes helped bring back some gold and silver in Scotland, and getting rid of twenty shilling notes might help even more. They say gold and silver have become more common in America since they got rid of some paper money, and they were also more available before that paper money was created.

Even if paper money is mostly used between businesses, banks can still help the country’s economy just as much as they did when paper money was everywhere. The cash that a business keeps on hand is mainly for buying goods from other businesses. They don’t need to keep cash for customers, who usually pay with cash instead of taking any from the business. So, even if only small amounts of paper money were allowed, banks could still support businesses by helping with real financial transactions.
