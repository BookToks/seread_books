Adam Smith

Entails are rules that keep land in the hands of one family, usually the oldest son. This can be really unfair because it makes one child rich while the others get nothing. 

These rules came from the idea of primogeniture, which means the firstborn inherits everything. They were created to make sure that land stays in the same family line and doesn’t get split up or given away. The Romans didn’t have these rules, and even though some French lawyers try to connect them to old Roman laws, they are actually quite different.

Back in the day, when big estates were like mini kingdoms, these rules might have made sense. They helped protect many people from losing their land because of one person's bad choices. But now, in Europe, where both big and small estates are protected by laws, these rules seem really silly. They suggest that people today don’t have the same rights to land as those who lived hundreds of years ago. 

Even though these rules are outdated, many parts of Europe still follow them, especially in places where being noble is important for getting certain jobs or honors. It seems unfair that nobles, who already have advantages, should have more rules that help them keep their power. In England, there are some limits on these rules, but they still exist. In Scotland, a lot of land is still tied up in these strict rules, making it hard to divide or use the land differently.

Because of these rules, large areas of land are owned by just a few families, and it’s almost impossible to change that. However, just because someone owns a lot of land doesn’t mean they will take good care of it. In the chaotic times when these unfair rules started, landowners were too busy protecting their land to improve it.
