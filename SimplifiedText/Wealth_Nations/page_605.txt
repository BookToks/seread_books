The Wealth of Nations

The reason these places were separated from Spain was probably just to cut off England's natural ally, the king of Spain. This also helped to create a stronger and more lasting bond between the two main branches of the Bourbon family than just being related by blood.

Joint-stock companies, which are set up by royal permission or government law, are different in a few ways from regular companies or private partnerships. 

First, in a private partnership, no partner can sell their share or bring in a new member without the group's approval. However, any member can leave the partnership and ask for their share of the money back. In a joint-stock company, though, members can sell their shares to anyone without needing permission from the company. They can also bring in new members this way. The value of a share in a joint-stock company is based on what people are willing to pay for it in the market, which can be more or less than what the owner is credited for in the company.

Second, in a private partnership, each partner is responsible for all the company's debts, meaning they could lose everything. But in a joint-stock company, each partner is only responsible for the amount they invested.

A joint-stock company is run by a board of directors. This board is sometimes overseen by a larger group of owners, but most of these owners don’t really understand how the company works. When there’s no fighting among them, they usually don’t worry about it and just accept the profits the directors decide to give them every six months or year. This lack of hassle and limited risk encourages many people to invest in joint-stock companies, even if they wouldn’t take the same risk in a private partnership. Because of this, joint-stock companies often have much more money than private partnerships. For example, at one point, the South Sea Company had over thirty-three million eight hundred thousand pounds. Right now, the Bank of England has about ten million seven hundred eighty thousand pounds. However, since the directors are managing other people's money, they might not be as careful with it as partners would be with their own money.
