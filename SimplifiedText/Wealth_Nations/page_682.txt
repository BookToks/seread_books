Adam Smith thought that landowners might not want to improve their land if the government, which doesn’t pay for the improvements, gets to share in the profits. To fix this, he suggested that before a landowner starts any improvements, they should work with tax officials to figure out how much their land is worth. This should be done with help from other landowners and farmers nearby, who can give fair opinions. Then, the government should tax the landowner based on this value for a number of years that would fully cover their costs.

One of the main benefits of this kind of land tax is that it gets the government interested in improving the land because it wants to increase its own revenue. The time allowed for the landowner to recover their costs shouldn’t be too long, but it also shouldn’t be too short. If it’s too short, it might discourage the landowner from making improvements. The government’s interest is more general, while the landowner’s focus is on making every part of their land as useful as possible.

The government should encourage both landowners and farmers to work in their own best interests. It should make sure they feel secure in getting rewarded for their hard work and help them find markets to sell their products easily, both on land and water. 

If this kind of tax is managed well, it could actually encourage landowners to improve their land instead of discouraging them. The only downside for the landowner would be having to pay the tax. 

This type of tax would adjust itself to changes in society, like improvements or declines in farming, and changes in the value of money, without needing much attention from the government.
