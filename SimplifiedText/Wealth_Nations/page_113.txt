The Wealth of Nations

The law has tried to increase the pay for church workers, called curates, to make sure they get more than the really low pay they might accept. But it hasn’t worked. The law couldn’t make curates earn more money or lower the pay for workers as it wanted. This is because curates often accept less money due to their tough situations and the many people competing for the same jobs. At the same time, other workers can earn more because there are people willing to pay them for their help.

Big church jobs and titles help keep the church respected, even if some of its lower-ranking members don’t earn much. People still respect the job, which helps make up for the low pay they receive. In England and other Catholic countries, church jobs can actually pay better than needed. Looking at churches in Scotland, Geneva, and other Protestant places shows that even with lower pay, many educated and respectable people still want to join the church.

In jobs like law and medicine, if a lot of people were trained for free, there would be so many people competing that their pay would drop a lot. It might not even be worth it for someone to pay for their kid’s education in those fields. Those jobs would end up being filled by people who got their training through public programs, and they would likely have to settle for very low pay, which would hurt the reputation of law and medicine.

People who are writers or scholars are in a similar situation to what lawyers and doctors might face if too many people were trained for free. In Europe, many of them were trained for the church but couldn’t become priests for various reasons. So, they were mostly educated with public funds, and since there are so many of them, they often have to accept very low pay for their work.

Before printing was invented, the only way for a writer to make money was through their talent.
