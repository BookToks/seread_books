The Wealth of Nations

There were one hundred and fifty private money lenders who went bankrupt over a few years.

It's clear that things like canals and water systems for big cities are really useful. But they often cost more money than what regular people can afford.

Besides the four types of businesses I mentioned, I can't think of any other ones where all the reasons for starting a joint-stock company make sense. Companies like the English copper company in London, the lead-smelting company, and the glass-grinding company don’t really seem to have any big benefits. Plus, the work they do doesn’t seem to need a lot of money that most people can’t afford. I’m not sure if their business is organized enough to be run as a joint-stock company or if they make a lot of money. The mine-adventurers company went bankrupt a long time ago. Right now, shares in the British Linen company of Edinburgh are worth less than they should be, although they are worth a bit more than a few years ago.

Joint-stock companies that are supposed to help with certain types of manufacturing often end up doing more harm than good. Even when they have good intentions, the leaders of these companies tend to favor certain parts of the business, which can hurt others. This messes up the natural balance between smart work and profit, which is really important for the overall success of the country.

The institutions that educate young people can also make enough money to cover their own costs. The fees that students pay to their teachers help create this income.

Even if the teacher’s pay doesn’t come entirely from these fees, it doesn’t have to come from the general money that society collects and uses, which is usually managed by the government. In most of Europe, this is how it works.
