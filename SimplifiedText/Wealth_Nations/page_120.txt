Adam Smith talks about how poor people need certificates to live in a certain area. These certificates are usually given by the place they want to leave, which can be unfair. He mentions that it can be tough for someone to stay in a place where they have settled, even if they want to move somewhere better.

Even though a certificate just shows that a person belongs to a certain area, the local officials can choose whether to give it or not. There was a case where someone tried to force the church leaders to sign a certificate, but the court thought that was a strange request.

In England, the pay for work can be very different in nearby places. This is partly because the law makes it hard for poor people to move to another area without a certificate. A single man might get by without one, but if he has a wife and kids, he would likely be forced to leave if he tried to stay without a certificate. If the single man later gets married, he would probably be moved too.

This means that if one area needs more workers, they can’t easily get them from another area because of these rules. In other countries, like Scotland, people can move freely, and while wages might change near big cities, they don’t have the weird pay differences that England has. There, it can be easier for someone to cross a natural boundary, like a river or mountains, than to move from one parish to another.

Taking someone away from where they want to live, especially if they haven’t done anything wrong, isn’t fair. The regular people in England care a lot about their freedom, but like many people in other countries, they don’t always understand what true freedom means. For over a hundred years, they have put up with these unfair rules.
