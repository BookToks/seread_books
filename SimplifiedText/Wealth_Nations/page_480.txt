Adam Smith talks about how having control over certain goods, like tobacco, gives countries an edge over others. This advantage isn't just about being better; it's more about holding others back. 

For example, England has a monopoly on tobacco from Maryland and Virginia, which means it can sell it cheaper to itself than France can buy it. But if France and other countries had free trade with Maryland and Virginia, they might be able to get tobacco for an even lower price than England does now. This could lead to more tobacco being produced, which might lower prices even more. 

If that happened, England wouldn't really have any special advantage anymore. They might still buy tobacco a bit cheaper and sell their own stuff for a higher price, but other countries could do the same. So, while England might gain some benefits, they would lose their edge over other countries. 

To keep this advantage in their trade, England has likely made some sacrifices and tried to keep other nations from getting involved.
