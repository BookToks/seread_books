There are two types of work. One type makes things more valuable, while the other type doesn’t really add any value. The first type is called productive work, and the second type is called unproductive work.

For example, a manufacturer who makes products adds value to the materials he uses, his own pay, and his boss's profit. On the other hand, a servant who does household tasks doesn’t really add value to anything. Even though the manufacturer gets paid by his boss, he actually helps create more value, so his wages are covered by the profits from his work. But the money spent on a servant doesn’t come back in the same way.

A person can get rich by hiring many manufacturers, but they can lose money by having many servants. The work of a servant is still valuable and deserves to be paid, but it doesn’t create a lasting product. The work of a manufacturer results in something that can be sold or used later, like a product that can generate more work if needed.

In contrast, the work of a servant doesn’t create anything lasting. Their help is often gone as soon as it’s done, and it doesn’t leave behind anything of value that could be used again. 

Some important jobs in society, like those of government officials and military personnel, also don’t create lasting value. They serve the public and are paid from the work and earnings of others.
