The Wealth of Nations

A person who can support themselves and their family without needing help from others is truly independent.

In places where there isn’t much land available to farm or it’s hard to get, people who have extra supplies try to sell their work farther away. For example, a blacksmith makes iron goods, and a weaver creates fabrics. Over time, these different types of work get more specialized and improved in many ways, which is easy to understand without needing to explain too much.

When looking for ways to invest money, making things is usually preferred over trading with other countries, just like farming is preferred over making things. This is because the money a farmer or landowner has is safer than what a manufacturer has, and the manufacturer’s money is safer than what a foreign trader has. At any time, if a society has extra goods that people don’t want at home, they need to sell them abroad to get something they do want. It doesn’t really matter if the money used to sell these goods comes from inside or outside the country. If a society doesn’t have enough money to farm all its land and make the most of its raw materials, it can actually be better for a foreign investor to help sell those raw materials so the society can use its resources more effectively.

The wealth of ancient Egypt, China, and India shows that a country can be very rich even if most of its exports are handled by foreigners. The growth of North American and West Indian colonies would have been much slower if they only used their own money to sell their extra goods.

So, naturally, in a growing society, most of the money is first used for farming, then for making things, and finally for trading with other countries. This pattern is so natural that it has always been somewhat true in societies with land. Some land must be farmed before big towns can be built, and some basic manufacturing must happen in those towns before they can think about expanding further.
