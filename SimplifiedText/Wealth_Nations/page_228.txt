Adam Smith talks about how things like land, mines, and fisheries need money and resources to work properly. Even though these things can wear out or get lost, they still need some money to keep going.

Farmers and manufacturers depend on each other. Farmers give food to manufacturers, and in return, manufacturers provide the finished products that farmers need. Usually, farmers don’t trade their crops directly for clothes or tools. Instead, they sell their crops for money, which they then use to buy what they need.

Land also helps support fisheries and mines. The food produced on land helps catch fish, and it’s also what helps get minerals from the ground.

The amount of food, fish, and minerals produced depends on how much money and effort is put into them. If the resources are used well, they will produce more.

In places where people feel safe, most people try to use whatever money they have to enjoy life now or make money later. If they spend it now, it’s for immediate enjoyment. If they invest it for future profit, it can either stay with them or be used elsewhere. If it stays, it’s called fixed capital; if it moves around, it’s called circulating capital. It would be really foolish not to use all the money available to you in some way.

In countries where people are scared of their leaders, they often hide or bury their money to keep it safe.
