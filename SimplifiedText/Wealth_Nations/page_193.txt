The increase in the money price of different types of raw materials isn’t because silver has lost value. Instead, it’s because these materials are now worth more in terms of the effort and resources needed to get them. It takes more work and resources to bring these products to market, so when they do arrive, they are worth more.

The third type of raw material that tends to get more expensive as things improve is one where human effort can only increase the amount to a certain point or it’s unpredictable. Even though the price of these materials usually goes up as things get better, there are times when it might drop or stay the same, depending on how successful people are at increasing the supply.

Some raw materials are linked to others, meaning the amount of one type is limited by the amount of the other. For example, the amount of wool or raw hides a country can produce depends on how many cattle it has. The level of farming and how advanced it is also affects this number.

The same factors that raise the price of meat should also raise the prices of wool and hides by a similar amount. This would likely happen if, at the start of improvement, the market for wool and hides was as small as the market for meat. However, the markets for these products are usually very different.

The market for meat is mostly limited to the area where it’s produced. For example, Ireland and some parts of British America do export some salted meat, but they are pretty much the only places that trade a lot of meat with other countries.

On the other hand, the market for wool and hides is rarely limited to just the country that produces them. They can be easily shipped to faraway places; wool can be sent without any processing, and raw hides can also be transported easily.
