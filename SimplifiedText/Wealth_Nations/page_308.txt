Adam Smith talks about how farming is something that people have always been drawn to. Even though farmers need help from skilled workers like blacksmiths, carpenters, and tailors, they still prefer to work the land. These skilled workers often need each other’s help too, so they tend to live close together, forming small towns or villages.

In these towns, you’ll find butchers, bakers, and brewers, along with other workers who provide goods and services that everyone needs. The people in the town and the farmers in the countryside rely on each other. The town acts like a big market where country folks come to trade their raw goods for things that are made. This trade helps the town's people get the materials they need for their work and to live.

The amount of stuff the town sells to the country affects how much they can buy. So, if the demand for their products goes up, they can make more and earn more. This demand can only grow if farming and land improvement also grow. If things had gone naturally without interference, towns would have grown and become wealthier as farming improved.

In North America, where there’s still a lot of land that hasn’t been farmed, towns haven’t really set up factories for selling goods far away. When a skilled worker has some extra money, they usually invest it in buying and improving land instead of starting a factory. They prefer to become farmers rather than work for someone else. They know that as a skilled worker, they depend on their customers for money, but as a farmer, they can work for themselves and take care of their own land.
