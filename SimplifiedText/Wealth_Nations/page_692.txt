Adam Smith says that when people have to pay taxes, they might not want to pay as much for land. This means that the tax burden would mostly fall on the landowners. He believes that empty houses shouldn’t have to pay taxes.

Both ground-rents and regular land rents are types of money that landowners make without doing much work. Even though some of this money should go to the government to cover expenses, it won’t stop people from working hard. The overall wealth produced by the land and labor of society could stay the same even with a new tax. So, ground-rents and regular land rents might be the best types of income to tax.

Ground-rents might be a better target for special taxes than regular land rents. This is because regular land rents often depend on how well the landlord takes care of the property. If the tax is too high, it might make landlords less interested in managing their land well. Ground-rents, on the other hand, are mostly due to good government, which helps people earn more money than the land is really worth. It makes sense to tax money that comes from good government more than other types of income.

In many European countries, there are taxes on house rents, but I don’t know of any that treat ground-rents as a separate tax. Tax creators probably find it hard to figure out what part of the rent is ground-rent and what part is for the building. However, it shouldn’t be too hard to tell them apart.

In Great Britain, house rents are taxed similarly to land rents through something called the annual land tax. The way each area is taxed is usually the same, but it started out very unfair and still is. In most places, this tax is lighter on house rents than on land rents. Only in a few areas, which were originally taxed high, does this not apply.
