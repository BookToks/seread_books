Adam Smith talked about how cities like Paris and Bordeaux get goods from other places, especially for people living there. Bordeaux is known for its great wines, which come from nearby rivers. These cities attract a lot of money because they create many jobs, which helps them grow.

In other towns in France, not much money is used beyond what they need for themselves. This is also true for cities like Paris, Madrid, and Vienna. Among these, Paris is the busiest, but most of what it makes is for its own people. 

London, Lisbon, and Copenhagen are unique because they have royal courts and also trade for other cities and countries. Their locations are really good for shipping goods to faraway places. In cities where a lot of money is spent, it’s harder to use that money for anything other than what the city needs. When many people rely on money from the rich, it can make others less motivated to work hard.

Before Scotland's Union, Edinburgh didn’t have much trade or industry. Once the Scottish parliament moved away and it wasn't the main home for the nobility anymore, it started to grow in trade. However, it still has important courts and government offices, so money is still spent there. But compared to Glasgow, which has more industry and jobs, Edinburgh is behind. Sometimes, a big lord moving into a village can make the people there lazy and poor, even if they were doing well before.
