Adam Smith talks about how the debt from past wars is really big. The interest on this debt is actually more than all the extra money that could have been made from controlling trade with the colonies. It's even more than the total value of all the goods sent to the colonies each year.

It's not hard to figure out who created this whole trade system. It wasn't the consumers, who were ignored, but the producers. The merchants and manufacturers were the main people behind it. The rules about trade that we've talked about focus a lot on helping manufacturers, but they often hurt the consumers and other producers.

Now, let's talk about agricultural systems in political economy. This part won't take as long to explain as the trade system did. The idea that the produce from land is the only source of a country's wealth and income has never really been accepted by any country. Right now, it’s just a theory that a few smart people in France think about. It’s probably not worth spending a lot of time on a system that hasn’t caused any problems and likely won’t in the future. But I’ll try to explain the main ideas of this clever system as clearly as I can.

Mr. Colbert, who was a well-known minister during King Louis XIV's time, was a significant figure in this discussion.
