If we grew more potatoes instead of just wheat and other grains, we could feed a lot more people with the same amount of land. Since most workers would eat potatoes, there would be more leftover food after taking care of the crops and the workers. This extra food would mostly go to the landowners. As a result, the population would grow, and rent prices would go up a lot more than they are now.

Land that can grow potatoes can also grow many other useful vegetables. If potatoes took up the same amount of land as corn does now, they would affect the rent prices of other crops too. I've heard that in some places in Lancashire, people think oatmeal bread is better for workers than wheat bread. I've heard the same thing in Scotland. But I’m not so sure about that. The average people in Scotland who eat oatmeal don’t seem as strong or as good-looking as those in England who eat wheat bread. They don’t work as well or look as good either. However, the rich people in both countries don’t show much difference, which suggests that the food for regular folks in Scotland might not be as good for them as it is for those in England. 

On the other hand, potatoes seem to be different. Many strong men and pretty women in London come from the lower classes in Ireland, where people mostly eat potatoes. This shows how healthy potatoes can be for people.

But it’s tough to keep potatoes fresh all year long, and you can’t store them like you can with grains for a couple of years. The worry about them going bad before they can be sold makes farmers hesitant to grow them. This is probably the main reason why potatoes haven’t become the main vegetable food for everyone, like bread has.

When it comes to what land produces, food seems to be the only thing that always gives some rent to the landowner. Other types of crops might or might not provide rent, depending on different situations.
