The Wealth of Nations

When goods are sent to other countries, it usually means that people want those goods more in the other country than at home. This is because the stuff being sent out is expected to be worth more when it comes back. For example, if tobacco in England is worth £100,000, but when it goes to France, it can buy wine worth £110,000 in England, then England gains £10,000 from that trade. 

If £100,000 worth of English gold buys French wine that’s worth £110,000 in England, England also gains £10,000. A merchant with £110,000 worth of wine is richer than someone with only £100,000 worth of tobacco or gold. This is because the wine can create more jobs and help more people than the other two. 

The total wealth of a country is made up of the wealth of all its people. The amount of jobs and businesses that can be supported each year depends on how much wealth everyone has. So, trading with other countries usually helps increase a country’s wealth and the number of jobs available. 

It would be better for England to trade its own products, like tools and clothes, for French wine instead of using tobacco or gold. Direct trade is always better than trading in a roundabout way. However, trading using gold and silver isn’t worse than other roundabout trades. A country without gold and silver won’t run out of them just because it trades them away, just like a country that doesn’t grow tobacco won’t run out of it if it can buy it.

Some people say that a worker trading with a pub is a bad deal, and that trading with a wine country is similar. But I think trading with a pub isn’t always a bad deal. It can be just as good as any other trade, even if it can be misused more easily. Jobs like brewing and selling drinks are just as important as any other kind of work. It’s usually better for a worker to trade in a way that helps them and the economy.
