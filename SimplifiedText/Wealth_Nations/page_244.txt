Adam Smith says that a bank can easily handle about forty thousand pounds in money. To be ready for unexpected needs, the bank has to keep ten thousand pounds in gold and silver all the time. If the bank tries to use forty-four thousand pounds, the extra four thousand pounds will come back to it quickly, almost as soon as it gives it out. So, to be safe, the bank should keep fourteen thousand pounds instead of just eleven thousand pounds. This way, it won’t lose money trying to manage that extra four thousand pounds, which would just keep leaving the bank.

If every bank had paid attention to its own needs, there wouldn’t have been too much paper money in circulation. But not every bank did this, and that’s why there was often too much paper money around.

Because the Bank of England issued too much paper money, it had to make a lot of gold coins, around eight hundred thousand to a million pounds each year. Sometimes, the bank had to buy gold at a high price to make these coins, which meant it lost money when it sold the coins for less. Even though the government helped with the costs of making coins, the bank still had to deal with its own expenses.

Scottish banks faced similar problems. They had to hire people in London to collect money for them, which cost them one and a half to two percent. They also had to pay extra to send money by wagon. Sometimes, the agents couldn’t get money back to the banks fast enough. When that happened, the banks had to ask their partners in London for help by sending bills of exchange for the money they needed. Later, those partners would ask the banks to pay them back.
