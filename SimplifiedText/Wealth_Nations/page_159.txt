The Wealth of Nations talks about how important corn is in understanding value in society. Basically, corn is a better way to measure value compared to other things like silver or meat. This is true no matter how wealthy a country is or how much it has improved. 

Corn is a big part of what workers eat in every developed country. Because farming has gotten better, there’s way more plant food than animal food available. Most workers eat the cheapest and healthiest food, which is usually corn. Meat is not a big part of their diet unless they live in richer countries. In places like France and Scotland, poor workers rarely eat meat except on special occasions. 

So, the pay for workers is more affected by the price of corn than by the price of meat or other food. The real value of gold and silver, meaning how much work they can buy, is also more connected to how much corn they can buy than to how much meat they can buy. 

Some smart people have been confused about this because they think that as more silver is found, its value goes down. But this idea doesn’t really make sense. The amount of valuable metals can go up for two reasons: either because more mines are found or because people are working harder and producing more. The first reason can lower the value of these metals, but the second reason doesn’t have to.
