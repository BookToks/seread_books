The Wealth of Nations

The laws that were made kept raising the taxes on imported goods. When there were food shortages, these laws could have really hurt people. But during those tough times, the laws were usually put on hold by temporary rules that allowed foreign corn to be brought in for a short time. This shows that the main law wasn’t really working well.

These limits on bringing in corn were set up before a certain reward system was created, but they came from the same ideas that led to that system. Even though these limits were harmful, they became necessary because of that reward system. If corn prices were low, foreign corn could have been brought in without high taxes. This could have led to exporting it again for profit, which would have hurt the government’s income and messed up the whole idea of supporting local farmers instead of foreign ones.

The business of selling corn to other countries doesn’t really help the local market directly. But it does help indirectly. No matter where the corn comes from, if we don’t grow or import more than what people usually eat, the local market won’t have enough corn. If farmers and importers can’t sell extra corn, they won’t grow or bring in more than what’s needed. This means the market will often have less corn than it needs, as sellers worry about not being able to sell their products. If exporting corn is banned, farmers will only grow what local people need. But if they can export, they can grow more to sell to other countries.

In the past, there were laws that allowed corn to be exported when wheat prices were low. At first, this was allowed when wheat was under a certain price, and later it was allowed even when prices were higher. There was a small fee to pay to the king for exporting, but it was so low that it didn’t really cost much for wheat or oats.
