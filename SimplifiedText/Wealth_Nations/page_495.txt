The Wealth of Nations

Monopolies can make things worse for everyone by making wages lower than they could be. 

When monopolies increase profits for businesses, they make it less likely that land will be improved. The profit from improving land depends on how much more it can produce with some investment. If improving land can make more money than other business investments, people will invest in land. If not, they will put their money into businesses instead. So, when business profits go up, it either makes land improvement less appealing or takes money away from it. This means that monopolies slow down the growth of another important source of income, which is the rent from land.

Monopolies also keep interest rates higher than they should be. When interest rates go up, the price of land compared to the rent it brings in usually goes down. This means that landlords lose out in two ways: their rent doesnâ€™t grow as much, and the price they can sell their land for drops compared to the rent it earns.

While monopolies do increase profits for some merchants, they also slow down the overall growth of capital. A small profit on a large investment usually brings in more money than a big profit on a small investment. So, even though monopolies raise profit rates, they prevent the total profits from getting as high as they could be.

Overall, monopolies make wages, land rent, and business profits much lower than they could be. They help a small group of people at the expense of everyone else in the country and even people in other countries. 

The only way monopolies seem to help a specific group is by raising the usual profit rates. However, they also create many negative effects for the country as a whole.
