The Wealth of Nations

In Scotland, before the Union, farmers had a way of managing their land that involved rotating which parts they used for crops. They would plow some areas, use them until they were worn out, and then let them rest. Usually, only about a third or a fourth of the farm was kept in good shape with fertilizer, and sometimes it was even less than that. The rest of the land wasn’t fertilized, but some of it was still used for crops, even if it got worn out too. Because of this way of farming, Scotland wasn't able to produce as much food as it could have.

Even though this farming method seemed bad, the low prices for cattle made it hard to change. Even when cattle prices went up, many farmers stuck to their old ways because they didn’t know any better or were used to it. Plus, there were other problems that made it hard to improve things quickly. Many farmers were poor and didn’t have enough cattle to farm their land properly. The higher prices made it harder for them to buy more cattle, and they also hadn’t had enough time to make their land good enough to support more animals.

To improve farming and have more cattle, both things need to happen together. You can’t really improve the land without having more cattle, and you can’t have more cattle without better land. Fixing these problems takes a lot of time and hard work. It might take fifty to a hundred years before the old farming methods are completely gone in all parts of the country. 

One of the best things Scotland got from joining England was the rise in cattle prices. This not only made highland farms worth more but also helped improve farming in the lowlands. In new colonies, there’s often a lot of unused land that can only be used for grazing cattle at first. This makes cattle very plentiful, and when there’s a lot of something, it usually becomes cheaper.
