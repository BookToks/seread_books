Grass is way better than corn for certain things. In big towns, people need a lot of milk and food for horses, which makes grass more valuable than corn. This is something that only happens close to the town, so it doesn’t help farms that are far away.

Sometimes, some countries have so many people that they can’t grow enough grass and corn for everyone. So, they focus on growing grass, which is heavier and harder to transport from far away. They end up importing most of their corn from other countries. Right now, Holland is in this situation, and ancient Italy was like this when the Romans were doing well.

A long time ago, a guy named Cato said that feeding people well was the most important thing for running a farm. Feeding them okay was the second most important, and feeding them badly was third. He thought plowing was only the fourth most important. In ancient Italy, especially near Rome, farming corn was discouraged because they often gave out corn for free or really cheap. This corn came from conquered lands, which had to give a part of their crops to Rome at a low price. Because of this cheap corn, the price of local corn dropped, making it less appealing for farmers to grow it.

In open areas where corn is the main crop, a good piece of grassland can rent for more than nearby corn fields. This grassland is important for keeping the cattle that help grow the corn. The high rent for grass isn’t just because of its own value, but because it helps the corn farms. If the nearby lands get completely fenced in, the rent for grass might go down. Right now, in Scotland, the high rent for fenced land is due to how rare it is, but that might change. Fencing is better for grass than for corn because it makes it easier to take care of the cattle, and they eat better when they aren’t disturbed.
