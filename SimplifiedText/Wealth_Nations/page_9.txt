The Wealth of Nations has a big impact, not just on smart people, but also on how leaders and countries act. In the fourth book, I tried to explain different ideas and how they have affected people in various times and places.

The goal of the first four books is to explain where the money for most people comes from and how it helps them buy what they need each year. The fifth and final book talks about the money that governments or countries have. In this book, I wanted to show a few things: first, what the government needs to spend money on; which expenses should be paid by everyone in society and which should be covered by specific groups or individuals; second, the different ways society can help pay for these expenses and the pros and cons of each method; and lastly, why many modern governments end up borrowing money and how that affects the real wealth and yearly production of the land and labor in society.

BOOK I

The biggest improvements in how much work can produce and the skills involved seem to come from dividing up tasks. To understand how dividing labor works in society, it helps to look at specific industries. People often think that this division is most advanced in less important jobs, but it might not actually be more advanced there than in other, more significant jobs.
