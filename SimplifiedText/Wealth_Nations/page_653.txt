The Wealth of Nations

The bishop had just enough power to keep control over his own church leaders. Because of this, the king's situation got even worse than before. 

The church leaders in different European countries acted like a spiritual army. They were spread out, but they could all be directed by one leader and follow the same plan. Each country's church leaders were like a group in that army, and they could easily get help from other groups in nearby countries. Each group didn’t depend on the king of the country they were in; instead, they relied on a foreign leader who could turn them against the king and get support from other groups.

These church leaders had a lot of power. Back in the old days of Europe, before things like factories and trades were common, the church's wealth gave them a strong influence over regular people, just like the wealthy barons had over their followers. The church received large pieces of land from kings and wealthy people, which gave them control similar to that of the barons. On these lands, the church leaders or their helpers could keep order without needing the king’s help, and the king couldn’t keep order there without the church’s support. 

The church leaders had their own areas of control, just like the powerful lords, and they didn’t have to answer to the king’s courts. The people who worked for the church were like the barons' workers; they were dependent on their church leaders and could be called to fight whenever the church wanted. Besides the land rents, the church also collected a lot of income from tithes, which were a portion of the earnings from all the other lands in Europe. Most of this income came in the form of goods like grain, wine, animals, and poultry. They had way more than they could use themselves, and since there were no factories or trades to swap for other goods, the church could only benefit from this extra surplus by using it like the barons did.
