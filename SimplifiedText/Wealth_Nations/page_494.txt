In England, the good things that come from trade with the colonies have mostly beaten the bad things caused by the monopoly. This is because of a few reasons. First, trade is mostly free, even though there are some rules. It's easier to sell almost all kinds of goods made in England to other countries without paying extra taxes. Also, people can move goods around the country without having to explain themselves to anyone. Most importantly, everyone is treated fairly under the law, which means that even the poorest person has rights that are respected. This fairness encourages people to work hard and be productive.

Even though trade with the colonies has helped British manufacturing grow, it hasn't been because of the monopoly. Instead, the monopoly has changed how things are made and sold, making it harder for businesses to thrive. It has shifted money away from industries that could create more jobs to ones that create fewer jobs. Because of this, the overall manufacturing in Britain has actually decreased instead of increased.

The monopoly on colony trade, like other unfair practices, hurts the industries of all countries, especially the colonies. It doesn't help the country that benefits from it either; instead, it makes things worse. The monopoly stops that country from using its money in ways that would create more jobs and income for its workers. Since money can only grow through saving from earnings, the monopoly keeps the country from making as much money as it could, which means it can't create as many jobs or provide as much income for its hardworking people.
