The Wealth of Nations

When trying to make taxes fair, they often end up being random and unpredictable. If we want them to be certain and not random, they end up being unfair. Whether a tax is light or heavy, uncertainty is always a big problem. With a light tax, some unfairness can be tolerated, but with a heavy tax, it becomes really hard to accept.

In England, during the time of William III, people were taxed based on their social rank. Nobles like dukes and earls were taxed differently than regular folks. Even shopkeepers and tradespeople who had more money were taxed the same way, no matter how rich or poor they were. Their rank mattered more than their actual wealth. Some people who were first taxed based on their wealth were later taxed based on their rank. For example, lawyers who were initially taxed based on their income were later taxed as if they were gentlemen. People found it easier to deal with some unfairness in a lighter tax than to deal with uncertainty.

In France, since the start of this century, taxes have been collected without interruption. The wealthy are taxed based on their rank, while the lower classes are taxed based on their estimated wealth, which changes every year. High-ranking officials and judges are taxed in one way, while regular people in the provinces are taxed differently. The wealthy in France can handle a bit of unfairness in a tax that isn’t too heavy for them, but they can’t stand random assessments from officials.

Lower-class people in France have to put up with whatever treatment their superiors decide for them. In England, the different poll taxes never brought in the money that was expected because they weren’t collected properly. But in France, the capitation tax always brings in the expected amount. The English government was okay with whatever money the poll tax brought in and didn’t ask for extra money when people couldn’t or wouldn’t pay. Many people didn’t pay, and the law was enforced gently, so they weren’t forced to.
