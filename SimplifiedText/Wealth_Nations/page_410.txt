The extra gold and silver in Spain and Portugal makes it harder for them to grow food and make things. Because of this, other countries can sell them many products for less gold and silver than it would cost to make those things at home. 

Taxes and rules about gold and silver work in two ways. They lower the value of gold and silver in Spain and Portugal. At the same time, keeping some of that gold and silver there makes it more valuable in other countries. This gives those countries an advantage when trading with Spain and Portugal. 

If Spain and Portugal let more gold and silver flow out, the amount in those countries would go down, but it would increase in other places. Eventually, the value of gold and silver would balance out everywhere. The loss of gold and silver for Spain and Portugal wouldn’t really hurt them. The prices of their goods might drop, meaning they would need less silver to show their value, but the actual worth of what they have would stay the same. 

Even though they would have less gold and silver, it would still be enough to buy and support the same amount of work. The gold and silver sent to other countries would come back as goods of equal value. These goods wouldn’t just be luxury items for rich people; they would mostly be materials, tools, and food for hard-working people. 

This means that the extra gold and silver wouldn’t make lazy people richer, and their spending wouldn’t increase much. Instead, the goods would help workers create more value than what they consumed. This would turn some of the unused resources in society into active ones, leading to more jobs and a bigger output from their land and labor.
