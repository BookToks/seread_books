The Wealth of Nations

Money in a country can be divided into three parts: first, the money that people use every day; second, the silver and gold that families own; and third, the money saved up by the government over many years.

Usually, there isn’t much extra money lying around in the country. The amount of money needed depends on how many goods are bought and sold each year. There’s just enough money to keep things moving, and it doesn’t allow for extra. However, when there’s a war, some money is taken out of circulation. More people are sent to fight abroad, so fewer people are working at home. This means fewer goods are sold, and less money is needed for those sales. During such times, countries like England often print a lot of paper money, like notes and bills, to replace the gold and silver they send overseas. But this isn’t a great way to fund a long and expensive war.

Melting down family silver for money has never really helped much. For example, during the last war, the French didn’t gain enough from this to make it worth the trouble.

In the past, kings had big treasures saved up that could help during wars. Nowadays, except for the king of Prussia, most European leaders don’t focus on saving money. The money spent on wars in this century has been huge, and it didn’t really depend on the money people used daily, family silver, or the king’s treasure. The last war with France cost Great Britain over £90 million. This included a lot of new debt and extra taxes. Most of this money was spent far away, in places like Germany, Portugal, America, and the Caribbean. The kings of England didn’t have any big treasures saved up, and there wasn’t much silver melted down. The total amount of gold and silver in the country was thought to be around £18 million.
