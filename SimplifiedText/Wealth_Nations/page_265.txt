The Wealth of Nations

This situation probably happened because of bad weather, not because there was too much paper money.

If paper money was just promises to pay, and getting that payment depended on the kindness of the people who made the promises, or on something the person holding the money couldn’t always control, or if they had to wait a long time to get paid without earning any interest, then that paper money would be worth less than gold and silver. How much less it was worth would depend on how hard it was to get paid right away or how long they had to wait.

A while back, banks in Scotland used to put something called an optional clause in their bank notes. This meant they promised to pay the person holding the note either right away or, if they wanted, six months later, plus some interest for waiting. Sometimes, the bank directors would use this clause to delay payments. They would tell people who wanted gold and silver for their notes that they could wait for six months unless they were okay with getting less money. At that time, these bank notes were the main type of money in Scotland, but because people weren’t sure they could get gold and silver for them, their value dropped compared to real money.

During this problem, which mostly happened in 1762, 1763, and 1764, even though the exchange rate between London and Carlisle was fair, the rate between London and Dumfries was sometimes four percent worse for Dumfries, even though it was only about thirty miles away from Carlisle. This was because in Carlisle, people paid in gold and silver, while in Dumfries, they used Scottish bank notes. The uncertainty of getting those bank notes changed into real money made them worth four percent less.

The same law that got rid of ten and five shilling bank notes also removed this optional clause, which helped bring the exchange rate between England and Scotland back to normal, based on trade and money transfers.

In Yorkshire, sometimes getting paid even a small amount like 6d. depended on the person holding the note bringing change for a guinea to the bank. This was often really hard for people to do, and it made the whole situation even more complicated.
