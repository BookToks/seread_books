Adam Smith

No gold or silver mines have been found that are worth working right now. When the first English settlers came to North America, they promised to give one-fifth of any gold and silver they found to the king to get permission to settle there. This deal was included in the agreements made by Sir Walter Raleigh and the companies he worked with. The settlers were hoping to find gold and silver mines, and they also wanted to discover a shortcut to the East Indies. So far, they haven’t found either.

The colonies from a civilized nation that settle in empty or sparsely populated areas grow richer and stronger faster than other societies. 

These colonies bring knowledge of farming and other useful skills that would take many years to develop on their own in less advanced societies. They also bring ideas about government and laws from their home country, and they usually set up similar systems in their new settlements. In less advanced societies, the development of laws and government happens much more slowly than the development of skills, especially after some basic laws and government are established for protection. 

Every colonist usually gets more land than they can farm. They don’t have to pay rent and barely have any taxes. There’s no landlord taking a share of what they grow, and the government usually takes only a small portion. This gives them every reason to work hard and make the most of their land.
