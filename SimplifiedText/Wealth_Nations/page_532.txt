Adam Smith talks about some old laws that affected how certain products could be sold outside the country. 

For example, there were rules that stopped people from exporting raw animal hides and tanned leather unless they were made into boots, shoes, or slippers. This gave an advantage to local boot and shoe makers over farmers and tanners. Later on, tanners managed to get out of this restriction by paying a small tax. They also got some money back from taxes when they sold their leather abroad. 

However, farmers, who raise animals for their hides, still had to deal with the old rules. Since farmers are spread out all over the country, it’s hard for them to work together to change these rules. But manufacturers, who are usually in big cities, can easily team up. Even the horns from cattle couldn’t be sold outside the country, which helped the horn and comb makers have a monopoly over that trade.

These restrictions on exporting goods that aren’t fully finished aren’t just for leather. Manufacturers believe they should be the ones to finish any product before it can be sold. For instance, they don’t allow wool yarn to be exported because they want to keep that business for themselves. Even white cloths are taxed when they’re exported, which gives dyers an advantage over cloth makers. 

There are also rules against exporting watch and clock parts. The makers of these items want to keep prices low by not letting foreign competition drive them up. 

Some old laws from kings like Edward III and Henry VIII banned the export of all metals, except for lead and tin, probably because there was a lot of those metals available.
