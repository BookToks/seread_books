Adam Smith

Back in the day, things like cattle and poultry were a lot cheaper than corn. This wasn’t because silver was super valuable, but because those other things were not worth much. Silver didn’t buy more work back then; it was just that those items cost less compared to when people had more money and better living conditions.

In Spanish America, silver is cheaper than in Europe because it’s produced there, and it costs a lot to transport it to other places. For example, not long ago, an ox cost about 21 pence in Buenos Ayres, and a good horse cost 16 shillings in Chili. Even though the land is fertile, most of it isn’t farmed, so cattle and other animals can be gotten with very little effort. This low price doesn’t mean silver is worth a lot there; it just shows that those animals aren’t valued much.

It’s important to remember that the real value of silver and other goods is measured by how much work goes into them, not just by the price tag. In places where there aren’t many people, nature produces a lot of cattle and game, often more than what people can use. When there’s more supply than demand, the value of those goods changes.

In every society, corn is something that people have to work for. The amount of food produced usually matches how much people eat. No matter how much society improves, growing the same amount of corn in the same area will take about the same amount of work. Even though farming gets better over time, the rising prices of cattle balance things out.
