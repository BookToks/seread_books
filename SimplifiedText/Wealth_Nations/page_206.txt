It’s normal for improvements to slowly lower the real price of almost all manufactured goods. The cost of making things usually goes down because of better machines, more skilled workers, and better ways to divide and organize work. This means that less labor is needed to get a job done. Even if the price of labor goes up a lot because society is doing well, the big drop in how much labor is needed usually makes up for that price increase.

However, there are some products where the rise in the price of raw materials is so high that it cancels out the benefits of improvements in how the work is done. For example, in carpentry and some types of furniture making, the increase in the price of raw wood due to better land use can outweigh the advantages of using better machines and skilled workers.

But in cases where the price of raw materials doesn’t go up much, the price of the finished product drops a lot. This drop in price has been especially noticeable in the last hundred years for products made from cheaper metals. For instance, a watch that cost twenty pounds back in the 1700s can now be bought for just twenty shillings. The prices for items made by cutlers and locksmiths, as well as toys made from these cheaper metals, have also gone down a lot, although not as much as watches. This has surprised workers in other parts of Europe, who often say they can’t make anything as good for even double or triple the price. There are probably no other products where labor can be divided up more or where machines can be improved as much as with these cheaper metals.

In the clothing industry, though, prices haven’t dropped as much during the same time. In fact, I’ve been told that the price of high-quality cloth has actually gone up in the last five years.
