Adam Smith often bought lands that were for sale, and many of these lands were not being used. Merchants usually want to become wealthy landowners, and when they do, they often make the best improvements. A merchant usually invests his money in ways that can make a profit, while a typical landowner often spends money without expecting to earn it back. 

These different ways of handling money affect how they act in business. Merchants tend to be bold, while landowners can be more cautious. A merchant isn't afraid to spend a lot of money to improve his land if he thinks it will increase in value. On the other hand, a landowner, if he has any money at all, usually doesn't take such risks. If he makes improvements, he often does it with what he can save from his yearly income. 

If you've ever lived in a town where trade is important, you've probably noticed that merchants are much more active and ambitious than regular landowners. The habits of being organized, careful with money, and paying attention to details that come with being a merchant make them better at successfully improving their projects.

Lastly, trade and manufacturing brought order and good government, which gave people more freedom and security. Before this, many people lived in constant conflict with their neighbors and were dependent on their wealthy landowners. This change, though not often recognized, is one of the most important effects of commerce. 

In a place without trade or advanced manufacturing, a wealthy landowner who can't exchange most of what he grows ends up using it all for entertaining guests at home. If he has enough extra food to support a hundred or a thousand people, he can only use it to feed them. This means he always has many followers around him who depend on his generosity for food and must obey him, just like soldiers follow a leader who pays them. Before trade and manufacturing expanded in Europe, the hospitality of the rich was a big part of society.
