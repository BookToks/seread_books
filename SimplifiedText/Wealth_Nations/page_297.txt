The Wealth of Nations

When a foreigner invests money in a country, it helps create value just like if they were from that country. This money can be traded for things that people want, which helps keep businesses running. This is similar to how a big merchant's money supports workers and increases the overall value of what the society produces each year.

It's really important for a manufacturer’s money to stay in their own country. This helps create more jobs and adds more value to what the land and workers produce each year. However, even if the money isn't in the country, it can still be helpful. For example, British manufacturers who use flax and hemp imported from the Baltic Sea are beneficial to those countries. These materials are extra products from those countries that would lose value if they weren't traded for things that are in demand. Merchants who export these materials help the producers keep making them, and British manufacturers help the merchants by buying their goods.

Sometimes, a country, like a person, doesn't have enough money to improve and use all its land, make all its raw products ready for use, and transport the extra products to faraway markets where they can be sold. Many areas in Great Britain don’t have enough money to fully develop their land. For instance, a lot of wool from southern Scotland is sent to Yorkshire for manufacturing because they don’t have the money to do it locally. There are also small manufacturing towns in Great Britain where people don’t have enough money to send their products to distant markets where they can be sold. If there are any merchants in those towns, they usually work for richer merchants from bigger cities.

When a country doesn’t have enough money for all these needs, if more of it is used for farming, it will create more jobs within that country.
