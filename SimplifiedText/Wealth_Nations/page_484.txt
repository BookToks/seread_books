Adam Smith says that profits have dropped a lot, but they would have dropped even more if it weren't for the monopoly created by a certain law. 

When a country has higher profits than it normally would, it puts that country at a disadvantage in trade where it doesn't have a monopoly. This means that merchants in that country have to sell their goods at higher prices than they would otherwise. Because of this, their country has to pay more for imports and sell exports for more money. This leads to buying and selling less, and overall, they enjoy and produce less than they could.

It also puts them at a relative disadvantage. Other countries that don’t have the same issues can do better in trade. They can enjoy more and produce more compared to the country with the higher profits. This makes their advantages bigger or their disadvantages smaller. By raising the prices of what the country produces, it allows merchants from other countries to sell their goods for less, pushing the country out of many trade areas where it doesn’t have a monopoly.

Merchants in Britain often complain about high wages for workers as the reason their products are sold for less in other countries. But they don’t talk about how much profit they make. They focus on how much others are making but ignore their own profits. The high profits in Britain can actually raise the prices of British products just as much, or even more, than the high wages.

This is how money in Great Britain has moved away from many trade areas where it doesn’t have a monopoly, especially in Europe and around the Mediterranean Sea. Some of this money has moved to the colony trade because it offers better profits. This is due to the growth of that trade and the fact that the money needed to keep it going each year is often not enough. 

Some of the money has also been pushed away by the high profits in Britain, which gives other countries an advantage.
