The Wealth of Nations

A teacher who tries to compete with others is like a merchant trying to sell goods without any help, while others get a lot of support. If he sells his stuff for almost the same price, he won’t make much money, and he could end up poor or even bankrupt. If he tries to sell his goods for a much higher price, he might not get many customers, which won’t help his situation much. 

In many places, having a degree is important or really helpful for people with learned jobs, which includes most who need a good education. But to get that degree, you usually have to attend classes from public teachers. Just going to a private teacher’s lessons doesn’t always mean you can get a degree. Because of this, private teachers in subjects usually taught at universities are often seen as the least respected in the education world. A person with real talent can hardly find a more embarrassing or less rewarding job. 

The funding for schools and colleges has not only made public teachers less motivated but also made it really hard to find good private teachers. If there were no public schools, no subject would be taught unless there was a need for it or it was trendy to learn. A private teacher wouldn’t make any money teaching an old or useless subject that everyone thinks is silly. Those old subjects can only survive in schools that don’t rely on hard work for their success and money. 

Without public schools, a person who worked hard and learned everything they could wouldn’t be completely clueless about what people usually talk about. There aren’t public schools for women, so their education isn’t filled with useless or silly stuff. They learn what their parents or guardians think is important for them, and nothing more. Every part of their education is clearly aimed at helping them, either by making them more attractive or teaching them to be more reserved.
