The Wealth of Nations

The rent that a landlord should get for their land is just whatâ€™s left after paying all the costs needed to grow crops. This leftover amount is what makes the landlord's income. The workers who farm the land are called the productive class because they not only cover all their costs but also create this extra income. Their costs are called productive expenses because they help produce more crops each year.

The costs that landlords spend to improve their land are also seen as productive expenses. Until these costs, plus the usual profits, are fully paid back through the rent they charge, that rent should be protected from taxes and church fees. If not, it could stop landlords from improving their land, which would hurt future income for both the church and the government.

In a well-run system, these costs not only get paid back but also lead to more crops over time, so they are considered productive expenses. 

However, the only expenses seen as productive are those of the landlord and the farmer. Other expenses from different jobs, even those that people usually think are very useful, are seen as unproductive. 

For example, workers in factories and workshops, who many believe add a lot of value to raw materials, are considered unproductive in this system. Their work only replaces the materials, tools, and wages given to them by their boss. The money they make goes back to maintaining their boss, not creating new value.
