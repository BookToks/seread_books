Adam Smith believed that forcing farmers to also be corn merchants was a really bad idea. 

It made things harder for everyone because it messed up how money and resources were used in society. Farmers had to split their money between two jobs instead of just focusing on farming. If they could just sell all their crops to a corn merchant right away, they could put all their money back into their farms. This would help them buy more animals and hire more workers to make their land better. But since they had to sell their corn piece by piece, they had to keep a lot of their money tied up in storage all year. This meant they couldnâ€™t farm as well as they could have. So, instead of making corn cheaper, this rule actually made it harder to get and more expensive.

After farmers, corn merchants play a big role in growing corn. If they were supported and encouraged, they could really help farmers out, just like how wholesale dealers help manufacturers. 

Wholesale dealers buy goods from manufacturers quickly, sometimes even paying them before the goods are made. This allows manufacturers to keep all their money working for them, so they can make more products than if they had to sell everything themselves. Plus, since wholesale dealers have enough money to help many manufacturers, they can support them during tough times. 

If farmers had the same kind of relationship with corn merchants, it would be super helpful for them. They could keep all their money working on their farms. If something went wrong, they would have the corn merchant to help them out, instead of being completely on their own.
