BOOK II  
OF THE NATURE, ACCUMULATION, AND EMPLOYMENT OF STOCK  

INTRODUCTION  

In a simple society where people do everything for themselves, there’s no need to save up goods before doing business. Each person tries to meet their own needs as they come up. If someone gets hungry, they go hunting. If their clothes wear out, they use the skin of the first animal they catch. If their home starts falling apart, they fix it with nearby trees and dirt.  

But when people start dividing tasks among themselves, one person’s work can only cover a small part of what they need. Most of what they want comes from the work of others, which they buy using what they’ve made. However, they can only buy things after they finish and sell their own work. So, they need to have some goods stored up to support themselves and provide the tools and materials they need until they can sell their work. For example, a weaver can’t focus on weaving unless they have enough supplies saved up to keep them going until they finish and sell their fabric. This saving up has to happen before they can spend time on their specific job.  

The need to save up goods comes before dividing tasks. As people save more, they can divide their work into smaller tasks. When work is divided, the same number of people can produce much more because each person can focus on a simpler job. This leads to new machines being invented to help make those jobs easier and quicker. So, as work becomes more specialized, it’s important to keep providing jobs for everyone involved.
