A smart French writer named Mr. Messance, who works in St. Etienne, tries to show that poor people actually work more during cheap years than during expensive ones. He looks at how much and how valuable the goods made in three different factories are: one makes rough wool clothes in Elbeuf, and the other two make linen and silk in Rouen. His research, taken from official records, shows that the amount and value of goods produced in all three factories is usually higher in cheap years and lowest in expensive years. These factories seem to stay about the same over time, meaning they don’t really grow or shrink much.

In Scotland, the linen factory and the coarse wool factory in Yorkshire are growing and usually making more goods, even though there are some ups and downs. However, when I checked the yearly reports, I didn’t see that the amount produced was clearly linked to whether the years were cheap or expensive. In 1740, a year when there was a lot of scarcity, both factories seemed to drop in production. But in 1756, another year of scarcity, the Scottish factories actually did better than usual. The Yorkshire factory did worse and didn’t reach its previous levels until 1766, after a law was changed. After that, production really took off and kept getting better.

The success of big factories that sell to faraway places doesn’t really depend on whether things are cheap or expensive in their own countries. It’s more about what’s happening in the places where the goods are sold, like if there’s peace or war, how well other competing factories are doing, and how happy the main customers are. Also, a lot of extra work done in cheap years doesn’t get counted in the official records. For example, men who leave their jobs become independent workers, and women often go back to their parents to spin and make clothes for their families. Even independent workers don’t always sell their work publicly; they might just help their neighbors with things for personal use. So, a lot of what they produce doesn’t show up in those official records, which can sometimes be incomplete.
