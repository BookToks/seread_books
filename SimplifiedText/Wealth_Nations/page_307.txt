The Wealth of Nations

The value of a carriage is included in the price of what people buy. 

If you look at the farming around a big town compared to areas farther away, you’ll see how much the town helps the surrounding countryside. People often argue about trade and whether it’s good or bad, but no one really believes that either the town or the countryside loses out from trading with each other.

Basic needs like food come before things like comfort and luxury. So, the work that provides food has to come before the work that provides nice things. This means that farming and improving the land, which gives us food, has to happen before a town can grow, since towns mainly offer comfort and luxury. The town can only grow if there’s extra food produced by the countryside, which is what feeds the town. Sometimes, a town might get food from far away places, but this doesn’t change the main idea and can lead to different levels of wealth in different times and places.

In general, the way things work out of necessity, even if it’s not the same everywhere, is also influenced by what people naturally want. If human rules hadn’t messed with these natural desires, towns wouldn’t have grown more than what the surrounding land could support until that land was fully used and improved. When profits are about the same, most people prefer to invest in farming land rather than in factories or trading with other countries. A person who invests in land can keep a closer eye on it and their money is safer compared to someone who trades, since traders often have to risk their money with people they don’t know well in distant places. 

On the other hand, a landlord’s money, which is tied up in improving their land, seems to be as safe as it can be in a world full of uncertainties. Plus, living in the countryside is beautiful, offers a nice lifestyle, and brings peace of mind, especially where unfair laws don’t interfere.
