The price of a lamb is about 3 shillings and 6 pence. But it would be silly to think that there are usually 60 lambs for every ox just because of that price. It’s the same with gold and silver. Just because an ounce of gold can buy 14 or 15 ounces of silver doesn’t mean there are only 14 or 15 ounces of silver available for each ounce of gold.

In reality, there’s probably a lot more silver on the market compared to gold, even if gold is worth more. Usually, there’s more of a cheaper item available than a more expensive one, and the cheaper items are often worth more overall. For example, the total amount of bread sold each year is greater and worth more than the total amount of meat sold. The same goes for meat compared to poultry, and poultry compared to wild birds. 

There are way more buyers for cheaper stuff than for expensive stuff, so not only is there more of it, but it’s also worth more. So, when we look at gold and silver, silver is cheaper and gold is more expensive. We should expect that there’s usually more silver available and that it’s worth more than gold. If someone compares their silver with their gold items, they’ll probably see that they have more silver and that it’s worth more too. 

Many people have a lot of silver but no gold items. Even those who do have gold usually only have small things like watch cases or trinkets, which aren’t worth much. In British coins, gold is worth a lot more, but that’s not true everywhere. In some countries, gold and silver are almost equal in value. For example, in Scotland before it joined England, gold was only slightly more valuable. In many places, silver is actually worth more. In France, people usually pay with silver, and it’s hard to find more gold than what you need for your pocket. 

Overall, the higher value of silver items compared to gold items in most places makes up for the fact that gold coins are worth more in some countries.
