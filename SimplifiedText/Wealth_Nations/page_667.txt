The cost of education and training should be covered by the people who benefit from it or by those who choose to help out. 

When public services or projects that help everyone can’t be fully funded by the people who benefit the most, the rest of the money usually has to come from everyone in society. The money that society collects, after paying for things like defense and the leader's salary, needs to cover the gaps in funding for different areas. I will explain where this public money comes from in the next chapter.

The money needed to cover not just defense and the leader’s salary, but all the other important government expenses that don’t have their own funding, can come from two main sources. First, it can come from funds that belong to the government and aren’t dependent on the people’s money. Second, it can come from the money collected from the people.

The funds that belong to the government can come from things like investments or land.
