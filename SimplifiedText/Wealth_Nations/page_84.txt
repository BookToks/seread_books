Adam Smith talks about how workers need to be paid and fed while they work, but landlords might not always get their money. For example, the profits from trade in Bengal by the East India Company might be similar to this situation.

The usual interest rate in the market changes depending on how much profit people make. In Great Britain, merchants think that double interest is a good, average profit. This just means itâ€™s a common profit. If the normal profit rate is around eight or ten percent, it makes sense that half of that goes to interest when businesses borrow money. The borrower takes the risk, kind of like they are insuring the money for the lender. In many businesses, four or five percent can be enough profit for the risk and for the effort of using that money. But this balance between interest and profit can be different in places where profit rates are much lower or much higher. If profits are lower, they might not be able to pay half of it as interest; if profits are higher, they might be able to pay more.

In countries that are getting richer quickly, low profits can help keep prices down, even if wages are high. This lets them sell things at prices similar to their neighbors where wages are lower.

Actually, high profits tend to push up prices more than high wages do. For example, if workers in the linen industry get a two-pence raise, the price of linen only needs to go up by a little bit based on how many workers were involved and how many days they worked. The increase in price is just a simple math increase based on wages. But if profits for all the employers go up by five percent, the price increase based on profit is much bigger and grows faster. The employer of the flax dressers would want an extra five percent on the total cost of materials and wages they paid to their workers. The same goes for the employer of the spinners.
