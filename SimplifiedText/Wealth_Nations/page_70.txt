Adam Smith talks about how many kids die young, especially those from poor families. These families can’t take care of their kids as well as richer families can. Even though poor families often have more kids, fewer of them grow up. In places like foundling hospitals or charities, even more kids don’t survive compared to those in regular poor families.

Animals usually have more babies when there’s enough food for them. But in society, it’s mostly the poorer people who can’t support more kids. This leads to a lot of their children not living to adulthood. 

When workers earn more money, they can take better care of their kids, which means more of them can grow up. This also helps meet the demand for workers. If there are more jobs available, people will get married and have more kids to fill those jobs. If workers earn less than they need, it will create a shortage of workers, which will push wages up. If they earn too much, there will be too many workers, and wages will go down. The job market will balance itself out based on how many workers are needed.

This demand for workers affects how many people are born in different places. In North America, the population grows quickly. In Europe, it grows slowly. In China, it hardly changes at all.

When it comes to workers, a slave's upkeep is paid for by their owner, while a free worker pays for their own needs. But really, the costs for both types of workers end up being the responsibility of the employer. The wages paid to workers need to be enough so they can keep working and support their families.
