the higher price of flax and the pay for the people who spin it. The boss of the weavers also wants a five percent increase on the price of the linen yarn and the pay for the weavers. When prices go up, the rise in wages works like simple interest on a loan. But when profits go up, it’s more like compound interest. Business owners often complain about how high wages make prices go up, which means they sell less of their products, both locally and internationally.

The advantages and disadvantages of different jobs and investments in the same area should be equal or always moving toward being equal. If one job is clearly better or worse than others, a lot of people would rush to the better job or leave the worse one, making the benefits balance out again.
