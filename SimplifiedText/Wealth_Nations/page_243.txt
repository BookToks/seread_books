When people try to get their money from the banks, they want to turn their extra paper money into gold and silver. They can easily use that gold and silver by sending it to other countries, but they can't do anything with the paper money. This causes a lot of people to rush to the banks to get their money. If the banks seem slow to pay up, even more people will panic and join the rush.

Banks have regular costs like rent and paying employees. But they also have special costs. First, they need to keep a lot of cash on hand to pay people who want their money. This means they lose out on the interest they could earn on that cash. Second, they have to keep refilling that cash whenever it runs low because people are asking for it.

If a bank gives out more paper money than what can actually be used in the country, they need to keep even more gold and silver in their vaults. This is because the extra paper money will come back to them quickly, and they need to be ready for that. So, they have to increase their cash reserves more than just the amount of extra paper money they issued.

Also, if a bank is giving out too much paper money, they will run out of cash faster than if they were more careful. This means they have to spend more money constantly to keep their vaults full. The gold and silver they take out can't be used in the country anymore, so they have to send it to other places where it can be used. This makes it even harder for the bank to find new gold and silver to refill their vaults, which increases their costs even more. So, as their business grows, they have to spend even more to keep up. 

Now, letâ€™s say we look at all the paper money from a specific bank.
