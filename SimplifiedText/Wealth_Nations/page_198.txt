Adam Smith talks about a country where most of the land is used for raising cattle. In this country, the main value comes from the wool and hides of these animals. The landlords and farmers would be really affected by rules about prices, but regular consumers wouldn’t care as much. If the price of wool and hides goes down, it wouldn’t make the price of meat go up because the same number of cattle would still be fed. The amount of meat available wouldn’t change, so its price would stay the same. However, the overall price of cattle would drop, which would also lower the rent and profits for the land used to raise them.

There was a rule that stopped the export of wool, which some people wrongly say was created by Edward III. If this rule had been in place, it would have been really bad for the country. It would have lowered the value of a lot of land and made it harder for small cattle to improve.

When Scotland joined England, the price of wool dropped a lot because it couldn’t be sold in the big European market anymore and was stuck in the smaller British market. This would have hurt the value of land in southern Scotland, which is mostly used for sheep, but the rise in meat prices helped balance out the loss from wool prices.

Human effort to increase wool or hides is limited by what the country can produce. It also depends on what other countries do, like whether they decide to export these products or not. This makes it hard to predict how much can be produced. So, when it comes to increasing these raw products, human effort is both limited and uncertain.

The same goes for fish. The amount of fish available in the market is also limited and uncertain. This is affected by where the fishing happens and other factors.
