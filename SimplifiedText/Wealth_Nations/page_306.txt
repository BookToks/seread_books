the costs of transporting their goods. 

In simple terms, towns and countryside areas depend on each other for trade. The countryside provides food and raw materials, while towns create and sell finished products. This exchange can happen directly or through money. 

Towns rely completely on the countryside for their resources. But just because towns gain from this doesn't mean the countryside loses out. Both sides benefit, and everyone involved in different jobs gains from this system. 

People in the countryside can buy more manufactured goods from the town with less effort than if they tried to make those goods themselves. Towns also provide a place for farmers to sell their extra produce, which they can then trade for things they need. 

The more people and money there are in a town, the better it is for the countryside because it creates a bigger market for their goods. For example, corn grown close to a town sells for the same price as corn grown far away. However, the farther corn has to travel, the higher the price needs to be to cover the costs of growing it and bringing it to the market. 

Farmers near the town not only make the usual profits from their crops, but they also benefit from the extra value of not having to transport their goods as far as farmers from distant areas.
