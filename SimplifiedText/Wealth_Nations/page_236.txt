Adam Smith

When someone has a lot of money in the form of notes, it works just like cash. If they lend these notes to others, they still get paid interest, just like if they had lent out actual cash. This interest is how they make money. Even though some of these notes come back to them for payment, many of them keep being used for months or even years.

So, if someone usually has notes worth a hundred thousand pounds, they might only need twenty thousand pounds in actual gold and silver to handle any payments that come up. This means that the twenty thousand pounds can do everything that a hundred thousand pounds could do. They can still trade and sell the same amount of goods using the notes as they could with the gold and silver. Because of this, eighty thousand pounds of gold and silver can be saved and not used. If many banks do this at the same time, the whole country can run on just a fifth of the gold and silver it normally needs.

Let’s say a country has one million pounds in total money at one point, which is enough to handle all the goods produced by their land and work. Later, if banks start giving out notes worth one million pounds but keep two hundred thousand pounds in reserve for emergencies, there would be eight hundred thousand pounds in gold and silver left, plus a million in bank notes. That means there’s a total of one million eight hundred thousand pounds in money and notes.

However, the amount of goods produced hasn’t changed, so they still only need one million pounds to buy and sell everything. The way money moves around stays the same as before. If one million pounds is enough to fill that system, then anything over that amount just won’t fit and will overflow. So, with one million eight hundred thousand pounds in the system, eight hundred thousand pounds will overflow because it’s more than what can be used.
