The Wealth of Nations

Funding helps the government spend money without making it harder for people to save or invest. When the government spends a lot, it can hurt the overall wealth of society, but funding allows private citizens to fix that damage more easily.

However, this benefit of funding only really shows up during wars. If the government had to pay for wars using money raised in the same year, the taxes would only last as long as the war. People would be able to save more money during peaceful times than if the government kept using funding. Wars wouldn’t have to destroy old wealth, and peace would help create new wealth. Wars would likely end faster because people would feel the full weight of the costs and would get tired of them. The government would have to listen to the people and wouldn’t drag out the war longer than necessary. Knowing how heavy the costs of war are would stop people from wanting to start wars without a good reason. Times when people can save money would happen less often and would last shorter, while times when they can save a lot would last longer than they do with funding.

Also, when funding is in place, the extra taxes it brings can make it just as hard for people to save money during peace as it would be during a war without funding. Right now, the peace revenue in Great Britain is over ten million a year. If this money wasn’t tied up, it could be enough to support a strong war without needing to borrow more. But in peace, the people of Great Britain are just as burdened by taxes, and their ability to save is just as hurt as it would be during a very expensive war if funding had never been used.

When the government pays interest on its debt, it’s like the right hand is paying the left hand. The money doesn’t leave the country; it just shifts from one group of people to another, so the country isn’t actually losing any wealth. This idea is based on a misunderstanding of economics, and after looking at it closely, it becomes clear that it’s not true.
