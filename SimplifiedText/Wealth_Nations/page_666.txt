The cost of keeping society safe and supporting the leader is paid for by everyone in the community. It makes sense that everyone should chip in based on what they can afford.

The cost of running the justice system is also for the benefit of everyone. So, it’s fair that everyone helps pay for it. However, the people who cause these costs are usually the ones who do something wrong and need to go to court for help. The people who benefit the most from the justice system are those who get their rights back or are protected by it. Because of this, it’s reasonable for those who cause the need for justice, or those who benefit from it, to pay for it through court fees. We only need the whole community to pitch in when the criminals can’t afford to pay those fees.

Local costs, like those for police in a specific town, should be covered by local funds and shouldn’t be a burden on everyone else. It’s not fair for everyone to pay for something that only helps a few people.

The costs for maintaining good roads and communication are important for everyone, so it’s okay for everyone to help pay for it. However, the people who travel or move goods benefit the most from this, as well as those who buy those goods. In England, tolls and fees for roads are paid by these travelers and businesses, which helps reduce the financial load on the whole community.

The costs for education and religious instruction also benefit everyone, so it’s fair for everyone to help pay for it. However, it might be even better if those who directly benefit from these services contributed more.
