Their charter was special, and even though it wasn't officially approved by the government, people believed it gave them a real advantage. For a long time, they didn't have to worry much about competition. Their total money, which was never more than £744,000, and with shares worth £50 each, wasn't too high, and their business wasn't so big that it could lead to serious mistakes or bad behavior. Despite some big losses caused partly by the Dutch East India Company and some other issues, they managed to keep their trade going successfully for many years.

Over time, as people started to understand freedom better, it became less clear how much power a royal charter, not backed by the government, really had. The courts didn't always agree on this, and their decisions changed depending on the government and the mood of the time. More and more competitors started to appear, and by the end of Charles II's reign, throughout James II's, and part of William III's, they faced a lot of trouble.

In 1698, a plan was suggested to the government to borrow two million pounds at eight percent interest, if the people who invested were allowed to form a new East India Company with exclusive rights. The old East India Company offered seven hundred thousand pounds at four percent under the same conditions. But at that time, it was easier for the government to borrow two million at eight percent than seven hundred thousand at four percent. So, they accepted the new company's proposal and created a new East India Company.

However, the old East India Company could still trade until 1701. They cleverly invested three hundred and fifteen thousand pounds into the new company under their treasurer's name. Because of a mistake in the wording of the law that gave the East India trade to the new investors, it wasn't clear that everyone had to work together as one company. Some private traders, who only invested seven thousand two hundred pounds, claimed they could trade separately with their own money and take their own risks.

The old East India Company had the right to trade separately until 1701, and they also had the right to trade separately with the £315,000 they put into the new company. The competition between the two companies and the private traders almost ruined both of them. Later, in 1750, another proposal was made to the government...
