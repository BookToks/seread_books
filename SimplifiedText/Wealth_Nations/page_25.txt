The Wealth of Nations

People want to trade, but sometimes they can’t because they don’t have what the other person needs. For example, a butcher might have enough bread and beer, so he can’t trade with someone who only has those things. This makes it hard for everyone to help each other out.

To avoid these problems, smart people throughout history have tried to keep something valuable on hand that others would want. In the past, different items were used for trading. A long time ago, cattle were commonly used for trade, even though they were not very practical. Back then, people would say things were worth a certain number of cattle. For example, a piece of armor might cost nine oxen, while another could cost a hundred.

Different places used different things for trade. In Abyssinia, salt was used; in some parts of India, it was shells; in Newfoundland, dried cod; in Virginia, tobacco; and in some Caribbean islands, sugar. There’s even a village in Scotland where workers sometimes use nails instead of money to buy bread or drinks.

Eventually, people everywhere realized that metals were the best thing to use for trading. Metals last a long time and don’t spoil easily. They can also be divided into smaller pieces without losing value, which is something other items can’t do as well. For example, if someone wanted to buy salt but only had cattle, they would have to buy a whole ox or sheep at once. It’s hard to trade just a little bit of cattle because you can’t easily split them up. But if they had metals, they could trade just the right amount for what they wanted.
