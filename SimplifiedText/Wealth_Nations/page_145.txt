The Wealth of Nations

In Peru, mining for silver doesn’t usually make people a lot of money. When someone tries to start a new silver mine there, everyone thinks they’re going to lose everything and go broke, so people tend to avoid them. Mining is seen like a lottery, where the chances of winning don’t make up for all the losses, even though some big wins make many people risk their money on these bad ideas.

Even though mining isn’t very profitable for most, the government still makes a lot of money from silver mines. Because of this, they encourage people to find and work on new mines. If someone discovers a new mine, they can claim a piece of it that’s about 246 feet long and half that wide. They own that part of the mine and can work on it without paying the landowner anything. There’s a similar rule in Cornwall, where if someone finds a tin mine on unused land, they can mark out its limits and become the owner. They can work it or rent it out without needing permission from the landowner, but they do have to pay a small fee when they mine it. In both cases, the rights of the landowners are set aside for the sake of making money for the government.

The same rules apply in Peru for finding and working on gold mines. The king only takes a small tax from gold, which is one-twentieth of what the mine makes. It used to be one-fifth and then one-tenth, but those were too high for the miners to handle. According to some experts, it’s really rare to find someone who got rich from a silver mine, and it’s even rarer for someone to get rich from a gold mine. That one-twentieth tax is usually all that’s paid by most gold mines in Chile and Peru. Gold is also easier to smuggle than silver because it’s worth more for its size and because of how it’s found in nature. Silver is rarely found by itself; it usually comes mixed with other materials, making it hard to separate in large amounts without a lot of hard work.
