The extra money for each barrel of herring would be £1, 7, 5¾. 

If the herrings are cured using British salt, it would be £0, 14, 11¾. 

But if we add the cost of two bushels of Scotch salt, which is 1s.6d. per bushel, we get an extra £0, 3, 0. 

So, the total for each barrel would be £0, 17, 11¾. 

When buss herrings are sold in Scotland and pay a shilling per barrel in duty, the total would be £0, 12, 3¾. 

From that, we take away the shilling, which is £0, 1, 0. 

That leaves us with £0, 11, 3¾. 

Then, we add the cost of the foreign salt used to cure a barrel of herring, which is £0, 12, 6. 

So, the total money allowed for each barrel of herrings sold in Scotland is £1, 3, 9¾. 

If the herrings are cured with British salt, it looks like this: 

The extra money for each barrel from the busses is £0, 12, 3¾. 

From that, we take away the shilling paid when they are sold, which is £0, 1, 0. 

That gives us £0, 11, 3¾. 

If we add the cost of two bushels of Scotch salt, which is £0, 3, 0, then the total for each barrel sold in Scotland would be £1, 14, 3¾. 

Even though the lost money from exporting herrings isn't really a bonus, the money from herrings sold in Scotland definitely counts. 

This is a report about the amount of foreign salt brought into Scotland and the Scotch salt given out for free from the factories for fishing, from April 5, 1771, to April 5, 1782, along with the average for one year.
