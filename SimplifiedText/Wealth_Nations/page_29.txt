The Wealth of Nations

Let's look at some rules that help us understand how much things are worth. 

The word VALUE can mean two different things. Sometimes it shows how useful something is, and other times it shows how much you can trade it for other things. We can call the first one "value in use" and the second one "value in exchange." 

Things that are super useful often don’t have much value when you try to trade them. For example, water is really important, but you can’t trade it for much. On the other hand, a diamond isn’t very useful, but you can trade it for a lot of other stuff.

To figure out how the value of things changes when you trade them, I want to explain three main points. 

First, I’ll talk about what really determines the exchangeable value, or the actual price of things. 

Second, I’ll explain what makes up that real price. 

Lastly, I’ll discuss what can make prices go up or down from their usual levels. This includes reasons why the market price, which is the price you see when you buy something, doesn’t always match what we call the natural price.

I’ll do my best to explain these three topics clearly in the next chapters. I hope you can be patient with me, even if some parts seem a bit boring, and pay attention so you can understand everything, even if it still seems a little confusing. I’m willing to take my time to make things clear, but some parts might still be tricky because they’re pretty complicated.
