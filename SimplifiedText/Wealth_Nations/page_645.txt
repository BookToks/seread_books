The Wealth of Nations

Sometimes, religious leaders get support not because people really believe in them, but because of political reasons. When there are big arguments about religion, political groups often pick sides and team up with certain religious groups. To do this, they usually have to agree with the beliefs of that group. 

The religious group that teams up with the winning political side gets to share in the victory. They can then silence their opponents and gain more power. The groups that lost usually teamed up with the enemies of the winning side, so they end up being the losers. The religious leaders of the winning group become very powerful and can influence the leaders of their own party and make sure the government listens to them. 

Their first request is often to silence their opponents, and their second is to get paid for their work. Since they helped win, it seems fair that they get something in return. They also don’t want to rely on the people for money anymore. So, they ask for this support, thinking about their own comfort rather than how it might affect their power in the future. 

The government usually doesn’t want to give them what they ask for because it would rather keep that money for itself. But eventually, the government has to give in, even if it takes a long time and a lot of excuses. 

If politics hadn’t mixed with religion, and if the winning side hadn’t picked one religious group over another, they might have treated all groups fairly. Everyone would have been able to choose their own religion and priest without interference. There would have been many different religious groups, and each one might have had its own beliefs. Each teacher would have worked hard to keep and grow their followers, but so would every other teacher.
