Adam Smith talks about how taxes work, especially when it comes to money and property. 

If someone makes a lot of money, like ten thousand a year, they won’t hire many servants. This doesn’t really affect poor people. 

Taxes on profits from businesses don’t change how much interest people want when they lend money. Lenders won’t give money for lower interest rates to businesses that are taxed compared to those that aren’t taxed. When the government tries to tax money made from businesses, it can sometimes end up affecting how much interest people earn. 

In France, there’s a tax called the vingtieme, which is similar to the land tax in England. It’s based on the money made from land, houses, and businesses. This tax is usually enforced more strictly than the land tax in England. Sometimes, this tax can completely affect the interest earned on money. 

In France, people often invest money in what are called contracts for rent, which are like loans that can be paid back at any time. The vingtieme tax doesn’t seem to have raised the cost of these loans, even though it is applied to them. 

When someone owns property, taxes on it don’t usually lower its overall value; they just take away some of the money it makes. But when property is passed on, whether from someone who has died or from one living person to another, taxes can reduce its value. 

When property changes hands, like land or houses, it’s usually a public event that can’t be hidden for long. Because of this, these transactions can be taxed directly. However, when money is lent between people, it’s often a private deal, so it’s harder to tax directly. Instead, it can be taxed indirectly in two ways: first, by making sure the loan agreement is written on special paper that has a tax stamp, and second, by requiring certain rules to be followed.
