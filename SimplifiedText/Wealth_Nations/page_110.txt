Adam Smith talks about how businesses can set their prices without worrying about competition from others in their country. They also have rules that protect them from competition from other countries. When prices go up because of these rules, it's usually the landlords, farmers, and workers in the country who end up paying more. These groups often don’t fight against these monopolies because they don’t have the desire or ability to band together. Merchants and manufacturers convince them that what’s good for a few people is good for everyone.

In Great Britain, cities used to be much better at making things than the countryside, but that’s changed a bit. Now, the pay for country workers is getting closer to what factory workers earn, and farmers are making profits that are more similar to those in trade and manufacturing than they did a hundred years ago. This change happened because cities got a lot of support for their industries. Over time, businesses in cities grew so big that they couldn’t keep making the same profits as before. Just like any other industry, there are limits to how much they can grow, and when more businesses compete, profits go down. 

When city profits drop, money starts moving to the countryside, which creates more jobs for country workers and raises their pay. This money then spreads out across the land and helps farming, which is where it originally came from. I’ll explain later how this movement of money from cities to the countryside has helped improve many areas in Europe. Even though some countries have gotten rich this way, it’s a slow process that can be disrupted by many things, and it doesn’t always make sense. I’ll go into more detail about the interests, laws, and customs that led to this in the next parts of my work.

When people in the same job get together, even just to have fun, they often end up talking about ways to work together to raise prices. It’s hard to stop these meetings with any laws that would be fair and just. But even though the law can’t stop these gatherings,
