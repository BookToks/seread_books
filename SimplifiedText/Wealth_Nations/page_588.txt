Adam Smith talks about how, in modern Europe, courts pay lawyers and clerks based on how many pages they write. Courts want each page to have a certain number of lines and words. To make more money, lawyers and clerks sometimes use way too many words, which messes up the legal language in courts all over Europe. This could also mess up how legal processes work.

Whether the justice system pays for itself or judges get fixed salaries from another source, it doesn’t seem necessary for those in charge to manage the money. This money could come from renting out land, with each court managing its own estate. It could also come from the interest on a sum of money, which the court could lend out. In Scotland, a small part of judges' salaries comes from this interest. However, relying on this kind of money seems risky for something that should last forever.

The separation of the judicial (court) power from the executive (government) power started because society was getting busier and more complicated. Administering justice became a tough job that needed full attention. Since those in charge of the government didn’t have time to handle private cases, they appointed someone else to do it. In ancient Rome, consuls were too busy with politics to deal with justice, so they had praetors to take care of it. As European monarchies formed after the Roman Empire fell, kings and lords saw justice as too hard and not important enough for them to handle, so they also appointed judges or bailiffs to do it.

When the judicial and executive powers are mixed, it’s hard for justice to be served fairly because politics can get in the way. Those in charge of the state's big interests might make decisions that aren't always fair, even if they don’t mean to be corrupt.
