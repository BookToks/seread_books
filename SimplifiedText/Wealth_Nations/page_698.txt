Everyone is expected to honestly say how much money they have so they can be taxed fairly. In Zurich, there’s a law that says people should be taxed based on their income, which they have to declare under oath. They trust that no one will lie about it. In Basel, the state makes money from a small tax on goods that are sold outside the city. Citizens promise to pay their taxes every three months. Merchants and inn-keepers keep track of their sales themselves and send their tax amounts to the treasurer every three months. People believe this system works well and that it doesn’t hurt the state’s income.

In some Swiss areas, asking citizens to publicly declare their wealth isn’t seen as a big deal. But in Hamburg, it would be a huge problem. Merchants worry about having to reveal their true financial situation all the time. They think it could ruin their reputation and hurt their business plans. However, the people in these Swiss areas are more careful with their money and don’t feel the need to hide anything.

In Holland, after the new prince took charge, a tax of two percent was put on everyone’s wealth. Citizens calculated their own taxes and paid them, similar to how it’s done in Hamburg, and it was believed that they did this honestly. At that time, people really liked their new government, which they had just fought for. This tax was only meant to be paid once to help the state in a tough situation. It was too high to be a regular tax. In a place where interest rates are usually low, a two percent tax can be a lot of money for people. Very few could afford to pay it without using some of their savings. In a tough time, people might be willing to sacrifice some of their money to help the state, but they couldn’t keep doing that for long. If they did, it would eventually ruin them and make it impossible for them to support the state.
