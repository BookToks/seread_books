A lighter tax on malt could bring in more money than the heavy taxes we have now on malt, beer, and ale. This is because it's easier to cheat on taxes in a brewery than in a malt-house. Plus, people who brew for themselves don’t have to pay these taxes, unlike those who malt for personal use.

In London, a quarter of malt usually makes over two and a half barrels of porter, sometimes even three barrels. The taxes on malt are six shillings for a quarter, and for strong ale and beer, it's eight shillings per barrel. So, in a porter brewery, the total taxes on malt, beer, and ale can be between twenty-six and thirty shillings for a quarter of malt.

In country breweries, a quarter of malt often makes at least two barrels of strong beer and one barrel of small beer, and sometimes even two and a half barrels of strong beer. The tax on small beer is one shilling and fourpence per barrel. So, in country breweries, the total taxes on malt, beer, and ale usually add up to at least twenty-three shillings and fourpence, and often twenty-six shillings for a quarter of malt. Overall, across the country, the taxes on malt, beer, and ale average around twenty-four or twenty-five shillings for a quarter of malt.

If we removed all the different taxes on beer and ale and just tripled the malt tax from six to eighteen shillings for a quarter, we could raise more money from this one tax than we currently do from all the heavier taxes combined.
