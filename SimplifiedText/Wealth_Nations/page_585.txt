The Wealth of Nations

The king or ruler got money from his power, so it wasn’t realistic to expect him to give it all up. People often suggested that he should control and figure out how much money he should take. But once he set those rules, it was really hard to stop him from taking more than what was allowed. Because of this, the fairness of justice got messed up, and it was tough to fix.

Over time, the ruler’s own money wasn’t enough to cover the costs of protecting the country from other nations. So, it became necessary for the people to help pay for these costs through different taxes. It was often agreed that the ruler and his judges shouldn’t accept any gifts or payments for making decisions in court. It was thought that it would be easier to stop these gifts altogether than to control them properly. Judges were given fixed salaries to make up for what they might have lost from those gifts. The taxes people paid helped make up for what the ruler lost, too. So, it was said that justice was free.

But in reality, justice was never really free anywhere. Lawyers and attorneys always needed to be paid by the people involved in cases. If they weren’t paid, they would do an even worse job than they already did. The money paid to lawyers each year was way more than what judges made in salaries. Even though the judges were paid by the government, it didn’t really lower the costs of going to court. The main reason judges weren’t allowed to take gifts was to keep justice fair, not to make it cheaper.

Being a judge is a respected job, so many people want to do it, even if the pay isn’t great. The job of a justice of the peace, which is less important, is also something many local leaders aspire to, even though it can be a lot of work and often pays nothing. The total salaries for all judges, high and low, along with the costs of running the justice system, even if not managed very well, still add up to a small amount in any civilized country.
