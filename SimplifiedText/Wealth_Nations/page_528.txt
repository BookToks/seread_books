After shearing sheep, the owner has to tell the customs officer how many fleeces they have and where they are stored. Before moving any of the wool, they must also inform the officer about the number and weight of the fleeces, who they are selling it to, and where it’s going. If someone lives within fifteen miles of the sea, they can’t buy any wool unless they promise the king that they won’t sell it to anyone else nearby. If wool is found being taken to the seaside without following these rules, it gets taken away, and the person responsible has to pay a fine for every pound of wool. If someone tries to sell wool that wasn’t reported, it will also be seized, and if they want it back, they have to promise to pay triple the costs if they lose in court.

When there are strict rules for trading wool on land, it’s likely that shipping it by sea is also controlled. Anyone who wants to take wool to a port for shipping must first register it at that port, including details like weight and number of packages, before bringing it within five miles. If they don’t, they risk losing the wool and their transportation. However, there’s a rule that allows people to take their wool home from shearing, even if it’s close to the sea, as long as they inform the customs officer within ten days and give notice three days before moving it. They also have to promise that the wool will be unloaded at the specific port they registered it for. If any part of the wool is unloaded without an officer present, they not only lose the wool but also face an extra fine for every pound.

Wool manufacturers in England argue that their wool is special and better than wool from other countries, and that wool from elsewhere can’t match its quality.
