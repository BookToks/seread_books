The Wealth of Nations

The value of money in a country is important because it helps move and share goods. This is similar to how someone running a big project might replace old machines with new ones to improve their work. They take the money they saved from the old machines and use it to pay for materials and workers.

It's hard to say exactly how much money is needed for a country compared to the total value of what it produces each year. Different people have guessed that it could be one-fifth, one-tenth, one-twentieth, or one-thirtieth of that value. Even if the money is a small part of the total value, it still plays a big role in supporting jobs and businesses. When paper money replaces gold and silver, the amount of metal needed can drop to maybe one-fifth of what it was before. This means that the extra money can help grow businesses and increase the overall value of what the country produces.

In the last 25 to 30 years, Scotland has seen a lot of new banks pop up in towns and even some villages. This has changed how business is done. Most transactions now use paper money from these banks, and you rarely see silver or gold coins, except for change from a twenty-shilling banknote. Although the banks have had some issues that needed government rules to fix, they have still helped the country a lot. I've heard that the trade in Glasgow doubled in about fifteen years after the banks started, and Scotland's trade has more than quadrupled since the first two public banks opened in Edinburgh. One was the Bank of Scotland, set up by law in 1695, and the other was the Royal Bank, created by royal approval in 1727. I can't say for sure if the trade in Scotland or Glasgow really grew that much in such a short time, but if it did, itâ€™s a big deal.
