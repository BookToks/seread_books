Adam Smith believed that joining Great Britain with its colonies would actually make the British government stronger, not weaker. He thought that the government should have representatives from all parts of the empire to make good decisions. 

However, he knew that making this union happen wouldn’t be easy and that there could be some big challenges. But he didn’t think any of these challenges were impossible to overcome. The main issues might come from people's beliefs and opinions on both sides of the ocean.

People in Britain were worried that having too many American representatives would mess up the balance of power in the government. They feared it might give too much power to the king or to the people. But if the number of American representatives was based on how much tax they paid, then the number of people to manage would grow along with the resources to manage them. This way, the balance of power would stay the same as it was before.

On the other hand, people in America were concerned that being far from the government would lead to unfair treatment. But if they had enough representatives in Parliament, those representatives could protect them from any unfairness. The distance wouldn’t really weaken the connection between the representatives and the people they represented. The representatives would still know they needed the support of their constituents to keep their jobs. 

To keep that support, they would speak up about any wrongdoings by officials in America. Additionally, people in America might feel that their distance from the government wouldn’t last long. The country had been growing quickly in wealth and population, and in just over a century, American taxes might even surpass British taxes. If that happened, the center of the empire might naturally shift to where the most support was coming from.
