Adam Smith

Some universities have made changes, but many haven’t. A lot of these schools have stuck to old ideas and ways of teaching, even when better methods were available. The richest universities are usually the slowest to change and don’t like to mix things up in how they teach. On the other hand, smaller, less wealthy universities are quicker to adopt new ideas because their teachers need to keep up with what people think to stay respected and make a living.

Originally, schools and universities in Europe were mainly for training church leaders. They didn’t always do a great job teaching students the important subjects they needed. Over time, these schools started to educate almost everyone, especially wealthy young men. It seems like a good way to spend the time between being a kid and starting a real job, but what they teach isn’t always the best preparation for actual work.

In England, it’s becoming more common for young people to travel abroad right after finishing school instead of going to university. People say that traveling helps them grow. A guy who leaves home at 17 or 18 and comes back at 21 is usually a few years more mature. During his travels, he often picks up a bit of a foreign language, but it’s usually not enough to speak or write it well. However, he often comes back feeling more arrogant, less principled, and less able to focus on studying or working than he would have if he had stayed home. Traveling at such a young age and wasting time on fun activities without his parents around can lead to these issues.
