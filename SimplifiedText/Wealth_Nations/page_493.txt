The Wealth of Nations

People might lose their jobs because money is moving away from certain trades that pay more often. Even though the colony trade is good for Great Britain, it’s not because of the monopoly; it’s actually in spite of it.

The colony trade is better for selling manufactured goods than for raw materials from Europe. New colonies should focus on farming because land is cheap, making it a better choice than anything else. They usually produce a lot of raw materials and often have more than they need, so they export the extra instead of importing it from other places. In new colonies, farming takes up most of the workers, leaving few people for other jobs. Because of this, they often buy most of their manufactured goods from other countries instead of making them themselves. The colony trade helps European manufacturers, which in turn supports farming. The manufacturers create a new market for the crops and livestock from the colonies, making it easier for Europe to sell its food.

However, just having a monopoly on trade in busy colonies isn’t enough to keep manufacturing alive in a country. Spain and Portugal show this clearly. They were once good at making things before they had many colonies. Now, even with some of the richest colonies, they have stopped being manufacturing countries.

In Spain and Portugal, the negative effects of the monopoly, along with other issues, have likely outweighed the benefits of the colony trade. These issues include other types of monopolies, the drop in the value of gold and silver compared to other countries, high taxes that keep them out of foreign markets, and even higher taxes on moving goods within the country. Most importantly, the unfair legal system often protects wealthy people from paying back their debts, making hardworking people afraid to produce goods for those rich individuals. They worry about selling on credit because they can’t be sure they’ll get paid back.
