The Wealth of Nations

In France, the government gets most of its money from eight main sources. These include taxes like the taille, capitation, two vingtiemes, gabelles, aides, traites, domaine, and tobacco taxes. The last few are often managed by private companies. The first three are collected directly by the government, and it's widely known that they bring in more money than the other five, which are usually managed less efficiently.

Right now, France's finances could really use three big changes. First, if they got rid of the taille and capitation taxes and increased the number of vingtiemes, they could keep the same amount of money coming in. This would also make collecting taxes cheaper and stop the lower classes from being annoyed by the taille and capitation. The higher classes wouldn’t have to pay more than they do now. 

The vingtieme is similar to England's land tax. The taille tax mainly hits landowners, and since the capitation tax is based on the taille, it mostly affects the same group. Even if they increased the vingtiemes to make up for the lost money from the other two taxes, the higher classes wouldn’t feel any extra burden. However, some people might still complain because the taille is often unfairly applied. Those who benefit from the current system are likely to resist these changes.

Second, if they made the gabelle, aides, traites, and tobacco taxes the same across the country, it would cost less to collect them. This would also make trade within France easier, like it is in England. Lastly, if all these taxes were managed directly by the government, the huge profits that private tax collectors make could go to the state instead. However, the personal interests of individuals could block these last two changes just like they might block the first one.
