Adam Smith talks about how goods could only be moved between places by land, which made it hard to trade unless the items were really valuable compared to their weight. Because of this, there wasn’t much trade between faraway parts of the world. For example, what kind of goods could be worth the cost to transport from London to Calcutta? And even if there were valuable goods, how could they be safely moved through dangerous areas? Today, though, London and Calcutta trade a lot with each other, which helps both cities grow and supports their workers.

Since water transport is so much better, it makes sense that the first advancements in technology and jobs happened in places where it was easy to trade with the whole world. It took longer for these improvements to reach the areas further inland. Those inland areas mainly relied on the nearby land for selling their goods until they could connect to the coast or big rivers. So, the size of their market depended on how rich and populated their area was, and they improved only after their region got better. In North America, for example, farms usually developed along the coast or near navigable rivers and didn’t spread far from those areas.

The first civilizations, according to history, were near the Mediterranean Sea. This sea is huge and calm, with no strong tides or waves except for wind, which made it great for early navigation. Back then, people were scared to sail far from the coast because they didn’t know how to use a compass and their ships weren’t very good. Going beyond the Strait of Gibraltar was seen as a big and risky adventure. Even the Phoenicians and Carthaginians, who were the best sailors at the time, took a long time to explore beyond those waters.
