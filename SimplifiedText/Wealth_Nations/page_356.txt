Adam Smith talks about how trade with other countries helps people get what they want and enjoy life more. When countries trade, it doesn't matter if the local market is small; they can still specialize in making things really well. By trading, they can sell extra products to other places, which pushes them to make even more and better stuff. This helps everyone in society become wealthier.

Foreign trade is really important for all the countries involved. They all benefit, but the country where the merchant lives usually gains the most. This is because the merchant is busy meeting the needs of their own country more than others. Bringing in gold and silver to countries without mines is part of foreign trade, but it’s not a big deal. If a country only traded for gold and silver, it wouldn’t need to send out many ships.

The discovery of America didn’t make Europe rich just because of gold and silver. The mines in America made these metals cheaper. Now, people can buy nice silver items for a lot less than they could in the 1500s. With the same amount of work and resources, Europe can buy about three times more silver than before. When something costs less, more people can afford it, so now there are way more silver items in Europe than there would have been without the American mines.

While Europe has gained some convenience from this, it’s not a huge deal. Because gold and silver are cheaper, they’re not as useful as money anymore. Now, we need to carry more coins to buy the same things, like having to carry a shilling instead of a smaller coin. It’s hard to say which is more annoying: carrying more coins or the fact that they’re cheaper. Neither really changed Europe in a big way.
