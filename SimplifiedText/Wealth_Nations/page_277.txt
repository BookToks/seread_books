The Wealth of Nations

Money is used to buy and sell things we need, like food and clothes. If a country makes less stuff each year, it can’t keep the same amount of money for long. The amount of money that can be used in a country depends on how much useful stuff is made there each year. This stuff comes from the land and the work people do, or from things bought with what they made.

If the value of what’s made goes down, then the money available for buying things also goes down. But money that isn’t being used at home won’t just sit around. People want to make money from it, so they will send it to other countries to buy things that can be useful back home. This means that even if a country isn’t making as much, it can still get some extra stuff from abroad for a while. Money that was saved during better times and used to buy gold and silver can help a country keep going when times are tough. So, sending gold and silver out isn’t the main problem; it’s just a result of the country doing worse, and it might help a little bit.

On the other hand, when a country is doing well and making more stuff, the amount of money usually goes up too. If there are more goods to sell, more money is needed to buy and sell them. Some of the extra goods will be used to buy more gold and silver to help with all the trading. In this case, getting more gold and silver shows that the country is doing well, not the other way around. Gold and silver are bought everywhere, and the cost includes paying for the workers and resources needed to get them from mines to stores. A country that can afford to pay for these metals will always have enough of them. But a country that doesn’t need them won’t keep them for long.
