The Wealth of Nations

The ability to get more work done depends on two things: how skilled the workers are and how good the machines they use are. Workers in factories and manufacturing can break their tasks down into simpler steps more than farmers can. Because of this, factory workers can improve their skills and tools much more than farmers can. So, farmers don’t have any advantage over factory workers.

The amount of useful work that happens in a society relies on how much money is available to pay for that work. This money comes from savings, either from the people who run the businesses or from others who lend them money. If merchants and factory workers are better at saving money than farmers, they are more likely to create more jobs and increase the overall wealth of their society.

Lastly, even if we think that the wealth of a country is just about how much food and resources its people can get, a country that trades and makes things will usually have more wealth than one that doesn’t. Trading and manufacturing allow a country to bring in more food and resources than its own land can produce. People in cities might not own land, but they still get enough materials and food from other places to live and work.

Just like a city gets resources from the surrounding countryside, one country can get resources from other countries. For example, Holland gets a lot of its food from other countries, like cattle from Holstein and corn from all over Europe. A little bit of what they make can buy a lot of what other countries produce. So, a trading and manufacturing country can use a small amount of its products to get a large amount of raw materials from other countries, while a country that doesn’t trade has a harder time getting what it needs.
