There are good reasons to think that the tolls collected on roads in Great Britain don’t actually make as much money as people say. They claim it could be around half a million dollars, but that amount wouldn’t even be enough to fix five major roads in the country. Some people believe that this money could be used without adding extra costs for the public, similar to how the post office works now. I believe that some money could be made this way, but probably not as much as the planners think. However, there are some big problems with this idea.

First, if the tolls are seen as a way to help pay for the government’s needs, they would likely increase whenever the government needed more money. In Great Britain, this could happen pretty quickly. Since it seems easy to get a lot of money from these tolls, the government might rely on them a lot. Even if it’s doubtful that half a million could be saved from the current tolls, it’s likely that a million could be saved if the tolls were doubled, and maybe even two million if they were tripled. But I now believe that these guesses are probably too high. This extra money could be collected without needing to hire new workers. However, if the tolls keep going up, they would make it harder to move goods around the country. This would raise the cost of transporting heavy items, which would make it harder to sell those goods, and could even kill off important jobs in the country.

Second, a tax on vehicles based on their weight seems fair when it’s only used to fix the roads, but it’s unfair when it’s used for other things. When the tax is just for road repairs, each vehicle pays exactly for the damage it causes. But if the tax is used for other purposes, then each vehicle ends up paying more than just for the road damage. Since the tolls make goods more expensive based on their weight and not their value, it mostly affects the people who transport heavier items.
