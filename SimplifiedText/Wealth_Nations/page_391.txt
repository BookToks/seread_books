The Wealth of Nations talks about trade between two places. It says that if trade is balanced, neither place loses or gains anything. But if one side has more trade than the other, the one with less loses while the other gains. This idea is not completely true. Sometimes, trade that is forced, like through special deals or monopolies, can actually hurt the country it’s supposed to help. However, trade that happens naturally between two places is usually good for both, even if it helps one more than the other.

When I say "gain," I mean not just getting more gold and silver, but also increasing the value of what the country produces each year from its land and work, or boosting the money its people earn.

If trade is balanced and both places are just swapping their own products, they usually both benefit, and often equally. Each place helps sell some of what the other has extra, and this helps support jobs and income for people in both places. Since the products they trade are valued similarly, the money used in trade is also about the same. Both countries are working to produce their goods, so the income and jobs created will also be similar. The more they trade, the more income they can generate. For example, if they trade £100,000 worth of goods each year, both sides will earn that amount. 

If one place only sends its own products and the other sends back foreign goods, they would still be trading fairly, even if it looks unbalanced. In this case, both would benefit, but not equally. The place that only sends its own products might not gain as much as the other.
