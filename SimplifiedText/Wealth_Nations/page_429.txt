The Wealth of Nations

The law from Charles II, even with its flaws, has probably helped our local market and farming more than any other law. This law gave the inland corn trade the freedom and support it needed. The local market and farming are better off because of this inland trade than they would be if we relied on importing or exporting corn.

Experts say that the amount of grain brought into Great Britain is very small compared to what we consume—about one part in five hundred and seventy. So, for our local market, the inland trade is way more important than importing, by a ratio of five hundred seventy to one.

When it comes to exporting, the amount of grain sent out from Great Britain is only about one-thirtieth of what we produce each year. This means that for supporting local farming, the inland trade is thirty times more important than exporting.

I’m not really sure about the exact numbers here, but I mention them to show that many smart and experienced people believe that local corn trade is much more important than foreign trade. The low prices of corn right before this law was passed might be partly because of this law from Charles II, which had enough time to make an impact.

Now, let’s talk about the other parts of the corn trade. 

The trade where merchants import foreign corn for local use helps supply our market right away, which is good for everyone. It might lower the price of corn a bit, but it doesn’t really change its true value or how much work it can support. If importing corn was always allowed, farmers would probably earn less money for their corn over time. But that money would be worth more, buying them more stuff and creating more jobs. So, their actual wealth and income would stay the same, even if it might look different.
