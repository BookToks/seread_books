Adam Smith

If you take money out of the bank, it loses its special value. Just like a new shilling is worth the same as an old one, money from the bank becomes just like regular money when it’s mixed with it. While the money is still in the bank, everyone knows it’s better. But once it’s in someone’s hands, it’s hard to tell if it’s really different without a lot of effort. Plus, when you take it out, you lose the benefits of bank money, like being safe and easy to transfer, and using it for international payments. Also, you can’t take it out without paying a fee for keeping it there.

The money that people put in the bank, or the money the bank promises to give back, is what makes up the bank's original value. Right now, this is only a small part of what the bank has. To help with trading gold and silver, the bank has been giving credit for these deposits for a long time. This credit is usually about five percent less than the market price.

When someone deposits gold or silver, the bank gives them a receipt. This receipt lets them take their gold or silver back within six months if they give the bank an equal amount of bank money and pay a small fee. The fee is one-fourth of a percent for silver and half a percent for gold. If they don’t pay the fee by the end of the six months, the bank keeps the deposit at the price it was received. This fee can be thought of as a kind of rent for keeping the money safe. 

There are several reasons why the rent is higher for gold than for silver. One reason is that it’s harder to tell how pure gold is compared to silver. It’s easier to cheat with gold, which can lead to bigger losses. Also, since silver is the standard metal, the government wants to encourage people to deposit more silver than gold.

People usually deposit their gold or silver when the price is lower than usual and take it out again when the price goes back up.
