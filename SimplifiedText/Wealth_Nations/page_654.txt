Adam Smith talks about how the clergy in ancient times were really generous and helpful to others. They provided a lot of hospitality and charity. They took care of many poor people and even helped knights and gentlemen who had no money by letting them stay at monasteries, pretending to be there for religious reasons, but really just to enjoy the free food and shelter.

The followers of certain church leaders were often just as many as those of the richest nobles. In fact, when you added up all the clergy's followers, they might have had even more than all the nobles combined. The clergy worked together more than the nobles did because they followed strict rules from the Pope, while the nobles didn’t have any rules and often fought among themselves and with the king.

Even though the clergy's followers might have been fewer than the nobles', their teamwork made them stronger. The kindness and charity of the clergy not only gave them a lot of influence but also made their spiritual power even stronger. People respected them a lot because they helped feed many of the poor. Everything related to the clergy seemed sacred to the common people, so any attack on them was seen as a serious crime.

Given this situation, it was tough for the king to fight against the powerful group of clergy in his own kingdom, especially when they were backed by clergy from nearby areas. It’s not surprising that sometimes the king had to give in, and it’s amazing that he could ever stand up to them at all.

The special rights of the clergy back then, which seem strange to us now, like not being punished by regular laws, were a result of their power. It would have been really risky for the king to try to punish a clergyman for any crime if the church was ready to protect him, arguing that he was too holy to be punished. In those situations, the king had limited options.
