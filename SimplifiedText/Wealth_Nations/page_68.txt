Adam Smith talks about how much money a family of six needs to live. This family includes the dad, mom, two kids who can work, and two kids who can’t. He says they need about ten shillings a week or twenty-six pounds a year. If they can’t earn this money, they might have to beg or steal. He looked into this topic really carefully.

In 1688, a guy named Mr. Gregory King, who was good at math related to politics, figured out that a family of about three and a half people needs around fifteen pounds a year. His numbers are pretty close to what another person, Judge Hales, found. Both of them think that a family spends about twenty pence per person each week. Since then, the money people earn and spend has gone up a lot in many places, but not everywhere, and some reports about how much workers get paid might be exaggerated. 

It’s important to know that the pay for work isn’t the same everywhere. Different workers can get paid different amounts for the same job, depending on how skilled they are and how easy or tough their bosses are. When there aren’t laws about pay, we can only guess what the usual rates are. Experience shows that laws can’t really control wages properly, even if they try.

Over the years, the actual value of what workers earn has probably gone up even more than the money they get paid. Not only has grain become cheaper, but many other foods that help people eat well have also dropped in price. For example, potatoes now cost less than half of what they did thirty or forty years ago. The same goes for turnips, carrots, and cabbages, which used to be grown by hand but are now often grown with machines. Even garden vegetables are cheaper now. 

Most of the apples and onions eaten in Great Britain used to come from Flanders a hundred years ago. Improvements in making clothes from linen and wool have made them cheaper and better for workers. Plus, better tools made from metals are now easier to get and better quality for people who work with them.
