Adam Smith talks about gold and silver. Gold coins are easier to use than gold bars. In England, people can turn gold bars into coins, but it takes a long time—sometimes weeks or even months. This wait makes coins a bit more valuable than the same amount of gold in bars.

If silver coins were priced fairly compared to gold, the value of silver bars would probably drop below what they are worth at the mint. This is because even old and worn-out silver coins are valued based on how much good gold coins are worth.

If there was a small fee for making gold and silver coins, it would make coins even more valuable than the same amount of gold or silver in bars. This is similar to how trendy items can be worth more because of their style. The higher value of coins would stop people from melting them down or sending them to other countries. If coins had to be exported for some reason, most of them would come back because they would be worth more at home than just their weight in metal.

In France, there’s a fee of about eight percent for making coins, and their coins often return home after being sent abroad.

The prices of gold and silver bars can change for the same reasons that prices of other things change. Sometimes gold and silver are lost at sea or on land, and they also get used up in things like jewelry and decorations. Countries without their own mines need to keep bringing in more gold and silver to replace what’s lost. Merchants try to bring in just the right amount based on what they think people will want. But sometimes they bring in too much or too little. If they bring in more than needed, they might sell some for less than usual to avoid the hassle of sending it back. If they bring in less than needed, they can sell it for more than the usual price.
