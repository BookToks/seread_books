The Wealth of Nations

People can decide what kind of security they need, but they usually can't ask for less than thirty pounds. This is because a law says that if someone buys a property worth less than thirty pounds, they won't get a permanent place to live there. This amount is hard for most workers to provide, and often, they need to show even more security.

To help workers move around freely, a system of certificates was created. According to a law from the time of King William III, if someone had a certificate from the last place they lived, signed by local officials and approved by two judges, then other places had to accept them. They couldn't be kicked out just because they might need help; they could only be removed if they actually did need help. If that happened, the place that issued the certificate had to pay for their care and moving costs.

To make sure the new place was safe, the law also said that the person with the certificate couldn't gain a permanent spot there unless they rented a place that cost at least ten pounds a year or worked in a local job for a whole year. They couldn't earn a permanent spot just by working for someone, serving, or paying local taxes. Another law from Queen Anne added that the workers or apprentices of the person with the certificate also wouldn't get a permanent spot in that area.

Doctor Burn pointed out that there are good reasons for needing certificates when people move to a new place. For example, those with certificates can't settle down in the new place easily, and they can't bring in workers or apprentices. If they need help, it's clear where they should go back to, and the original place has to cover their costs. If they get sick and can't move, the place that gave the certificate has to take care of them. All these rules help keep things organized and make sure that places that donâ€™t give certificates can avoid problems too.
