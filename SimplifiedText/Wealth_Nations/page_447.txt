The Wealth of Nations

The people living around the Aegean Sea were pretty much like those in Sicily and Italy back then. The main city thought of its colony like a kid that needed help and support, but it also treated it like a grown-up that didn’t need direct control. The colony made its own government, created its own laws, picked its own leaders, and decided if it wanted to go to war or make peace with neighbors, just like an independent state. It didn’t have to wait for the main city to approve anything.

Rome, like many other ancient cities, started with a law that divided public land among its citizens. Over time, because of marriage, inheritance, and other reasons, the original land divisions got messed up. Often, land that was supposed to support many families ended up with just one person. To fix this, a law was made to limit how much land a person could own to about 350 acres. However, this law was mostly ignored, and the gap between the rich and poor kept growing. Most citizens didn’t own any land, and back then, it was hard for a free man to stay independent without land.

Today, if a poor person doesn’t own land, they can still work on someone else’s farm or run a small shop. If they have no money to start a business, they can find jobs as laborers or craftsmen. But in ancient Rome, rich people used slaves to work their land, and even the overseers were slaves. This meant that poor free men had almost no chance to work as farmers or laborers. All trades and businesses were run by the slaves of the wealthy, making it tough for poor free men to compete. So, citizens without land mostly relied on the kindness of candidates during elections. When tribunes wanted to rally the people against the rich, they reminded them of the old land divisions and pushed for the law that limited private property, which was seen as a key rule of the republic. The people then started demanding land.
