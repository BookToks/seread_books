Adam Smith talks about how people try to change their trade to focus more on selling things at home rather than sending them to other countries. For example, a merchant who sells goods to other countries will often prefer to sell as much as possible at home if they can make similar profits. This way, they avoid the risks and hassles of exporting goods.

Home is like the main hub where money and resources are always moving around. Even though sometimes people might be drawn to work in other places, most of the time, they want to invest in their own country. When money is used in local businesses, it creates more jobs and helps more people than if the same money was used in foreign trade. So, when profits are about the same, people usually want to invest in ways that help their own country the most.

Also, when someone invests in local businesses, they try to make sure that what those businesses produce is as valuable as possible. The value of what they produce affects how much profit they make. People invest in businesses to make money, so they always aim to support industries that will give them the best returns, whether in cash or other goods. 

The total money a society makes each year is equal to the value of everything produced by its industries. Since everyone tries to invest in local businesses and make their products valuable, they are actually helping to increase the overall wealth of society. Most people donâ€™t think about how their actions benefit everyone else; they just want to support local businesses for their own gain.
