In Holland, the price of gold and silver is usually higher than what the government says it should be. This is similar to what happened in England before they changed their gold coins. The price difference is usually between six to sixteen stivers for every mark, which is about eight ounces of silver that is mostly pure.

The bank has different prices for silver coins from other countries. For example, they pay twenty-two guilders for Mexico dollars, French crowns, and English silver coins. They pay a bit less for new Mexico dollars and other types of coins. The price for silver bars depends on how pure they are, starting at twenty-one guilders for less pure silver and going up to twenty-eight guilders for very pure silver.

For gold, the bank pays three hundred ten guilders for coins from Portugal, Guineas, and new Louis d’ors. They pay a little less for old Louis d’ors. The bank also gives a good price for gold bars, depending on how pure they are. Usually, they pay more for coins with known purity than for bars, which need to be tested to find out how pure they are.

Overall, the prices at the bank for gold and silver are similar. People can usually sell their receipts for gold and silver for the difference between the official price and the market price. These receipts are almost always valuable, so it’s rare for someone to let them expire or not use them.
