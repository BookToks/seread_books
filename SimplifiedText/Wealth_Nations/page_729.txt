The taxes on cheaper luxury items made in our country, which people buy for themselves, affect everyone pretty equally based on how much they spend. Poor people pay taxes on things like malt, hops, beer, and ale when they buy them; rich people pay taxes on what they buy for themselves and for their servants.

It's important to notice that the total spending of poorer people, or those below the middle class, is actually much higher in both amount and value than that of the middle class and those above them. The total spending of poorer people is much more than that of the richer classes. First, most of the money in every country goes to poorer people as wages for their work. Second, a big part of the money from land rent and profits also goes to poorer people, especially for paying servants and other workers who don’t produce goods. Third, some profits from small businesses also go to poorer people, which is a significant part of the total money made each year. Lastly, some land rent even goes to poorer people, with some of them owning a small piece of land.

So, while the spending of individual poorer people is small, when you add them all together, they spend way more than the richer people. The money left over for the richer classes is always much less in both amount and value. Because of this, taxes on spending that mainly hit the richer people are usually less effective than those that affect everyone or mainly target poorer people. The tax on the materials and production of homemade alcoholic drinks is the most effective tax on spending, and it mostly falls on what regular people spend. In the year ending July 5, 1775, this tax brought in a total of £3,341,837:9:9.
