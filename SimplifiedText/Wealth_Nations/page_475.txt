The Wealth of Nations

It seems like the first plan to set up colonies was based on foolishness and unfairness. People were foolishly chasing after gold and silver, and it was unfair to take land from peaceful natives who had welcomed the first explorers with kindness.

The explorers who started some of these colonies had other reasons besides just looking for gold, but even those reasons don’t make Europe look good. The English Puritans, who wanted freedom, escaped to America and created the four governments of New England. The English Catholics, who were treated unfairly, set up Maryland. The Quakers started Pennsylvania. The Portuguese Jews, who were kicked out of their homes and lost their money, went to Brazil and helped bring some order and work ethic to the troubled colony by teaching others how to grow sugarcane. In all these cases, it was the chaos and unfairness of European governments that led to the growth of America, not their wisdom.

In fact, when some of the most important colonies were created, the European governments had very little to do with it. The conquest of Mexico wasn’t planned by the Spanish council but by a governor in Cuba. It happened because of a daring adventurer who went for it, even though the governor later regretted trusting him. The conquerors of Chile and Peru, and many other Spanish settlements, only had a general permission to settle and conquer in the name of the king of Spain. They took on all the risks and costs themselves. The Spanish government didn’t help much, and neither did the English government when it came to establishing some of its key colonies in North America.

Once these colonies were established and became important enough for the mother country to notice, the first rules they made were mostly to make sure they kept control of trade. They wanted to limit the colonies' markets and boost their own at the colonies' expense, which ended up slowing down the colonies' growth instead of helping them thrive.
