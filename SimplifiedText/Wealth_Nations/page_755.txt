The Wealth of Nations

There was a fund that had to pay not just the bank's money but also other debts and expenses. This fund got bigger because of some laws made during King George I's time, which added more taxes that would last forever.

In 1717, another law created a new fund called the general fund to pay certain debts, which added up to £724,849:6:10½. Because of these laws, many taxes that used to be temporary became permanent. They were used to pay only the interest on borrowed money, not the actual money borrowed.

If money had only been borrowed temporarily, the government could have freed up public funds in a few years just by not taking on too much debt at once. But most European governments didn’t manage this well. They often took on too much debt right away and borrowed again before they paid off the first loans. This made it impossible to pay back both the borrowed money and the interest, so they only paid the interest, creating a situation called perpetual funding. This practice delayed freeing up public funds for a long time, but it allowed governments to raise more money quickly when they needed it. People in charge often focused on solving immediate problems instead of thinking about future finances.

During Queen Anne's reign, the interest rate dropped from six to five percent. In her twelfth year as queen, it was decided that five percent was the highest interest rate allowed for private loans. Soon after, many temporary taxes in Great Britain became permanent and were combined into one big fund.
