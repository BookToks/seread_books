Adam Smith said that a day's work could make ten times more stuff than it did before. But in some jobs, it only doubled the amount of work produced. So, if you traded what you made in most jobs for what you made in this specific job, ten times the work would only get you twice the amount from that job. This means that something like a pound of that product would seem five times more expensive than before, but really, it would be twice as cheap. Even though you’d need five times the other goods to buy it, you’d only need half the amount of work to get or make it. So, it would actually be easier to get than before.

However, the time when workers got to keep everything they made didn’t last long. Once land became owned by people and they started saving up resources, that changed everything. This shift happened before many big improvements were made in how much work could produce. Once land became private, the landowner wanted a part of everything the worker could grow or gather. The rent they charge is the first cut from what the worker produces.

Usually, the person farming the land doesn’t have enough to live on until they can harvest. They often get help from a farmer who hires them, and this farmer needs to share in what the worker produces or make a profit from it. This profit takes another cut from what the worker makes.

Most other jobs are similar. In many crafts and factories, workers need a boss to give them materials and pay them until their work is done. The boss takes a share of what the workers produce, which is how they make a profit.

Sometimes, a worker can be independent and have enough resources to buy their own materials and support themselves until their work is finished. In that case, they are both the boss and the worker, so they keep everything they make or the full value they add to the materials they use. This includes what would usually be two separate incomes.
