When one country sells its extra products to another country, it usually has to sell some of its own products for less money. This makes those products less valuable to them, and they don’t feel motivated to make more of them. Taxes on things people buy can lower the amount of work that goes into making those taxed items, whether they are made at home or bought from other countries. These taxes can also change the way businesses operate, often leading them to less profitable paths than they would have taken on their own.

Also, people often try to avoid these taxes by smuggling, which can lead to serious punishments that ruin the smuggler's life. Even though smuggling is illegal, some people might not feel like they are doing something wrong because the laws seem unfair. In places where the government is known for wasting money and misusing funds, people tend to ignore laws about smuggling. Many don’t feel guilty about buying smuggled goods, and pretending to care about it can make someone look like a hypocrite. 

Because of this, smugglers might think their actions are somewhat okay. When the law comes after them, they might fight back, believing they are defending what they see as theirs. What started as a risky choice can turn them into serious lawbreakers. When smugglers get caught, the money they used to spend on creating jobs is lost to the government or law enforcement, which doesn’t help society. Instead of supporting useful work, it just takes away from the overall economy and the jobs that could have been created.
