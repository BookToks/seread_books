The Wealth of Nations

If we change a few things, our economy could improve a lot in just a few years. Right now, our workers are struggling under a heavy burden.

The government giving money for exporting corn is just as silly as the old policies of Spain and Portugal. No matter how much corn we grow, this makes our corn a bit more expensive at home and cheaper for other countries. Since the price of corn affects the prices of everything else, it makes silver worth less here and a bit more there. This means foreigners, especially the Dutch, can buy our corn for less money than we can. An expert named Sir Matthew Decker says that sometimes they can even buy it cheaper than our own people can. This makes it harder for our workers to sell their goods for a low amount of silver, while the Dutch can sell theirs for less. This situation makes our products more expensive everywhere and their products cheaper, giving them an unfair advantage.

The money boost makes the price of our corn look higher, but it doesn’t really help our farmers or the country much. It might put a little extra cash in their pockets, and it could be tough to convince them that this isn't a big help. But if the value of that money drops and can buy less stuff, then the help is mostly just an illusion.

The only people who really benefit from this money are the corn merchants who buy and sell corn. When there’s a lot of corn, the extra money encourages them to export more than usual. In years when there’s not enough corn, it makes them import more than they would have needed. This means they get more business during both good and bad years. When there’s a shortage, they can bring in more corn and sell it for a higher price, making more profit than they would have if the good years had helped out the bad years.
