The Wealth of Nations

Gold and silver are easier to move from one place to another than most other goods, and they don’t lose much value during transport. So, when countries buy these metals just to sell or trade them later, gold and silver are the best options. This is a big part of why trading with Portugal is helpful for Britain, even if it’s not the main reason.

It’s clear that if Britain needs to add a little bit of gold and silver each year, they don’t need to import a lot. Even without direct trade with Portugal, it’s easy to get this small amount from somewhere else.

In Britain, goldsmiths do a lot of business, but most of the new silver they sell comes from melting down old silver. This means the total amount of new silver added each year isn’t very much, so they don’t need to import a lot. The same goes for coins. People don’t really think that most of the coins made each year, which used to be over £800,000 in gold, are actually new money added to what was already there.

In places where the government pays for making coins, the value of the coins is usually not much more than the same amount of gold and silver that isn’t made into coins. That’s because it’s easy to trade uncoined gold and silver for coins at the mint, even if you have to wait a little while. But in every country, most coins are worn down or not in perfect condition. Before the recent changes in Britain, many coins were below their standard weight, with gold being over two percent and silver over eight percent lighter than they should be.

If forty-four and a-half guineas, which are supposed to weigh a pound of gold, can buy just a little more than a pound of uncoined gold, then if those guineas are lighter, they can’t buy a full pound without adding more money. So, the market price for gold was higher than the mint price, around £47:14s. or even £48. When most coins were in bad shape, forty-four and a-half guineas fresh from the mint would...
