Adam Smith

People in higher positions often forget how to keep their influence and authority over those below them. They might be respected by their bosses, but when it comes to talking to those under them, they struggle to defend their ideas against even the most clueless critics.

On the other hand, followers of Zuinglius and Calvin gave the people in each parish the power to choose their own pastor whenever the church was empty. They also made sure that all clergy members were treated equally. However, when this system was in place, it mostly led to chaos and messed up the morals of both the clergy and the people. The equal treatment of clergy, on the other hand, seemed to have only positive effects.

As long as people could choose their own pastors, they were usually influenced by the clergy, especially by the most extreme ones. To keep their power in these elections, many clergy members acted like fanatics themselves, encouraged fanaticism among the people, and often chose the most extreme candidates. Even something as simple as picking a parish priest often led to big fights, not just in one parish, but in nearby ones too. In big cities, this split the residents into two groups. When a city became its own little republic or the capital of one, these petty disputes could stir up even more anger and lead to new divisions in both the church and the government.

In these small republics, leaders soon realized they needed to take control of who got to fill empty church positions to keep the peace. In Scotland, where this type of church government was set up, the rights to choose pastors were mostly taken away by a law during William III's reign. This law allowed certain groups in each parish to buy the right to choose their own pastor for a low price. This system lasted for about 22 years but was eventually canceled by a law during Queen Anne's time because of the chaos it caused.
