The Wealth of Nations

The government sometimes runs out of money and needs to borrow. When this happens, they can either promise to pay back the money in a short time, like a year or a few years, or they can set up a long-term plan to pay just the interest forever. In the first case, they think they can pay back both the money they borrowed and the interest within that time. In the second case, they only plan to pay the interest, and they can pay back the original amount whenever they want. When they borrow money this way, it’s called borrowing by anticipation, and when they do it for a long time, it’s called funding.

In Great Britain, the government often borrows money every year based on land and malt taxes. The Bank of England usually lends this money at an interest rate that has changed from 8% to 3% since the Revolution. The bank gets paid back as the taxes come in. If the money coming in isn’t enough, they cover it with money from the next year. So, the government spends money before it actually has it, like someone who spends their paycheck before they get it. They keep borrowing from their own sources and end up paying interest on their own money.

Back in the time of King William and Queen Anne, most new taxes were only for a short time, like four to seven years. A lot of the money raised each year came from loans based on expected tax income. But often, the money coming in wasn’t enough to cover what they owed, so they had to extend the time to pay it back.

In 1697, a law was passed that combined the shortfalls from several taxes into one big fund. This fund was extended until August 1706, allowing the government to manage the money better and cover the shortfalls.
