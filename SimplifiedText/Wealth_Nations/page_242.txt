Adam Smith talks about money and how it affects businesses. 

Imagine a merchant has five hundred pounds that he can't use to buy new goods. Because of this, the value of the goods in his warehouse is always five hundred pounds less than it could be if he had that money working for him. If he usually sells all his goods once a year, then he ends up selling five hundred pounds worth less than he could have. This means his profits are lower because he missed out on selling those extra goods. Also, fewer people can be hired to help prepare those goods for sale.

Now, let’s look at a merchant in Edinburgh. He doesn’t keep money sitting around. When he needs cash, he just borrows it from the bank and pays it back later with the money he makes from selling his goods. Because of this, he can keep more goods in his warehouse than the London merchant. This helps him make more money and gives jobs to more people who help prepare those goods.

Some might think that English merchants have an advantage because they can easily get loans. But Scottish merchants can also get loans just as easily, plus they have the benefit of their cash accounts.

When it comes to paper money, it can’t be worth more than the gold and silver it represents. For example, if twenty-shilling notes are the smallest paper money in Scotland, then the total amount of paper money that can be used there can’t be more than the amount of gold and silver needed for transactions worth twenty shillings or more. If there’s too much paper money, it can’t be used anywhere else, so it will go back to the banks to be exchanged for gold and silver. People will notice they have more paper money than they need and will want to exchange it for real money.
