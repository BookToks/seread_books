A shilling used to be a weight, like part of an ounce or a small part of a pound. Back in the day, when wheat cost twelve shillings for a quarter, a type of bread called wastel bread had to weigh eleven shillings and fourpence. However, the value of a shilling compared to a penny or a pound wasn’t always the same. In early France, a sou or shilling could be worth five, twelve, twenty, or even forty pennies at different times. Among the Saxons, a shilling sometimes only had five pennies, and it probably changed a lot just like it did for their neighbors, the Franks.

After Charlemagne in France and William the Conqueror in England, the values of pounds, shillings, and pennies became more stable, but their actual worth changed a lot. In many places, greedy rulers took advantage of their people and slowly reduced the amount of metal in coins. For example, the Roman as, which used to be worth a lot, lost value until it was only worth a tiny bit. Today, the English pound and penny are worth about a third of what they used to be, while the Scottish and French coins are worth even less.

Because of these changes, rulers could seem like they were paying off debts with less silver than before. But this was just an illusion, as creditors ended up losing money. Other borrowers could also pay back their loans with the new, less valuable coins. This kind of situation helped debtors but hurt creditors, sometimes causing bigger problems for individuals than major disasters would. 

This is how money became the main way to trade in all civilized countries, allowing people to buy, sell, or swap goods easily. Now, I’ll talk about the rules people follow when trading things for money or for each other.
