The people who borrowed money from a certain bank were mostly dreamers. They would use the money for big, fancy projects that they probably couldn’t finish. Even if they did finish them, those projects wouldn’t make enough money to cover what they cost. This means they wouldn’t create enough jobs to support the workers who helped with them.

On the other hand, regular people who borrowed money from private lenders were more likely to use it wisely. They would invest in practical projects that matched their budgets. These projects might not be as exciting, but they would be more reliable and profitable. They would pay back the money spent on them and create more jobs than the flashy projects.

So, this whole situation didn’t help the country’s wealth grow; it just moved money from smart investments to foolish ones.

Mr. Law, a well-known figure, believed that Scotland’s economy was struggling because there wasn’t enough money to use. He thought that by creating a special bank that could print money equal to the value of all the land in the country, he could solve this money problem. At first, the Scottish parliament didn’t like his idea. Later, the Duke of Orleans in France took a similar idea and changed it a bit.

This idea of making lots of paper money led to the Mississippi scheme, which was one of the craziest banking and investment plans ever. Mr. Du Verney explained how this scheme worked in detail, so I won’t go into that here. Mr. Law also shared his ideas about money and trade in a book he published in Scotland when he first suggested his plan. The flashy but unrealistic ideas in his and other similar works still influence many people today and might be part of the reason there’s been too much banking lately, both in Scotland and elsewhere.
