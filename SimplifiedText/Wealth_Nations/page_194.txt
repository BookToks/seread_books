Adam Smith talks about how some countries don’t use all the parts of animals they raise. Even if a country doesn’t need something, other countries might want it because they use it in their products.

In places where farming isn’t very good and not many people live, the price of wool and hides is usually much higher compared to the whole animal. This is different in countries where farming is better and there are more people, so there’s a bigger demand for meat. Mr. Hume noted that back in Saxon times, the wool was worth two-fifths of the whole sheep, which is a lot more than today. In some areas of Spain, people often kill sheep just for the wool and fat, leaving the rest of the body to rot or be eaten by animals. This happens a lot in places like Chile and Buenos Aires, where cows are mostly killed just for their hides and fat. It used to happen a lot in Hispaniola too, especially when pirates were around, before the French started settling and farming there, which made the cows more valuable.

As a country gets better and has more people, the price of the whole animal usually goes up. But the price of the meat goes up more than the price of the wool and hides. The market for meat is mostly limited to the country that raises the animals, so it grows as that country improves. However, the market for wool and hides can reach all over the world, so it doesn’t always grow as much. The overall world market doesn’t change much because of improvements in one country, so the market for those goods might stay the same even after improvements. Still, it should grow a bit because of those changes. If the country starts making more products that use wool and hides, the market might not get much bigger, but it would be closer to where the materials come from, and the prices for those materials could go up.
