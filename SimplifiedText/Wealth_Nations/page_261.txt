The Wealth of Nations

Banking helps people turn their unused money into something useful. It allows them to buy materials, tools, and food to work with, making their money productive for themselves and their country.

The gold and silver money that moves around a country is like dead weight. It’s valuable, but it doesn’t create anything on its own. Banking can replace a lot of this gold and silver with paper money, which helps the country make better use of its resources. You can think of gold and silver money like a road that helps transport goods but doesn’t produce anything itself. Banking acts like a special road in the air, turning some of those roads into fertile fields, which helps the country produce more from its land and labor.

However, it’s important to know that while banking can help, it also makes things less stable. Relying on paper money can be risky compared to using gold and silver. If something goes wrong, like losing a war and the enemy taking over the capital, the paper money could lose its value. This would cause a lot of chaos because people wouldn’t be able to trade easily; they’d have to barter or rely on credit instead. If taxes are usually paid in paper money, the government might struggle to pay its soldiers or keep supplies, making the situation much worse than if they had mostly used gold and silver.

A ruler who wants to keep their country safe should be careful not to create too much paper money.
