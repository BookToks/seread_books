The rent for houses has dropped a lot, and the land tax, which is three or four shillings for every pound, is said to be about the same as the actual rent of houses. Houses that are empty usually don’t have to pay this tax because the tax assessors often let them off the hook. This can sometimes make the tax amount different for specific houses, but the overall rate for the area stays the same. 

In Holland, every house is taxed at two and a half percent of its value, no matter how much rent it actually gets or if anyone is living in it. It seems unfair to make the owner pay tax on a house that isn’t rented out, especially since it’s such a big tax. In Holland, where the interest rate is only three percent, that two and a half percent tax can be more than a third of what the house would earn in rent. The way they value houses for tax purposes is often not very fair and usually lower than the actual value. When a house is rebuilt or fixed up, it gets a new value, and the tax changes accordingly.

The people who created the different taxes in England thought it would be hard to figure out the real rent for each house. So, they decided to base the taxes on something easier to see, which they thought would usually relate to the rent.

The first tax was called hearth-money, which charged two shillings for every fireplace in a house. To find out how many fireplaces there were, the tax collector had to go into every room. This made people really dislike the tax. After the Revolution, it was gotten rid of because it felt like a form of slavery.

The next tax was two shillings for every house that was lived in. If a house had ten windows, it had to pay four shillings more. If it had twenty windows or more, it had to pay eight shillings. Later, they changed it so that houses with twenty windows but less than thirty paid ten shillings, and those with thirty or more paid twenty shillings. Counting windows is usually easy from the outside, so the tax collector didn’t have to go into every room, making this tax less annoying than the hearth-money.
