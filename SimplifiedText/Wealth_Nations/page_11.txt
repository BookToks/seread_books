The Wealth of Nations

If people worked alone and didn’t know how to do their specific jobs, they wouldn’t be able to make many pins in a day—maybe just one or two. But because they divide the work and combine their skills, they can make a lot more pins now.

This idea of dividing work is true for other jobs too, even if those jobs can’t be split up as easily. When work is divided, it usually helps everyone be more productive. Different jobs have become separate because of this benefit. Countries that work hard and improve tend to separate jobs the most. In a simple society, one person does many tasks, but in a better society, one person usually just does one job. For example, farmers focus only on farming, and manufacturers focus only on making things. 

In manufacturing, many different people are involved in making a product. For instance, in making linen or wool, there are people who grow the plants, bleach the fabric, and dye the cloth. Agriculture, on the other hand, can’t split up jobs as much. A farmer who raises animals can’t be completely separate from one who grows crops, unlike how a carpenter works separately from a blacksmith. 

In farming, the same person often does multiple jobs like plowing, sowing seeds, and harvesting because these tasks happen at different times of the year. This makes it hard for one person to focus on just one job. Because of this, farming doesn’t always improve as quickly as manufacturing does. Wealthy countries usually do well in both farming and manufacturing, but they are often better known for their manufacturing skills. Their land is usually farmed better, and they put in more work and resources.
