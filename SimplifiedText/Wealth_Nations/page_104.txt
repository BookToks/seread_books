Adam Smith talks about some silly rules that seem really unfair. For example, a coach-maker can’t make his own coach-wheels or hire someone to make them; he has to buy them from a master wheel-wright. This rule comes from a law that was made in England a long time ago. But a wheel-wright, even if he’s never worked as a coach-maker, can make coaches or hire people to do it because the coach-making trade wasn’t around when that law was made. Because of this, many businesses in places like Manchester, Birmingham, and Wolverhampton don’t have to follow that law since they started after that time.

In France, the length of apprenticeships changes depending on the city and the trade. In Paris, many trades require a five-year apprenticeship. After that, to become a master, a person usually has to work another five years as a journeyman. During this time, he’s called the master’s companion.

In Scotland, there isn’t one law that sets the length of apprenticeships for everyone. It varies by different groups. If the apprenticeship is long, a person can usually pay a small fee to shorten it. In many towns, a small fee can also buy someone’s freedom to work in a trade. Weavers who make linen and hemp cloth, along with others who help them, can work anywhere without paying a fee. In these towns, anyone can sell meat on any legal day of the week. Generally, three years is a common apprenticeship length in Scotland, even for some skilled trades. Overall, the laws in Scotland aren’t too harsh.

Everyone has a right to their own work because it’s the basis of all other property. A poor person’s wealth comes from their skills and hard work. Stopping someone from using their skills in a way they choose, as long as it doesn’t hurt others, is a clear violation of their rights. It also takes away the freedom of both the worker and the people who want to hire them. Employers should be trusted to decide if someone is fit for a job since it directly affects their interests. The law shouldn’t be overly worried about this.
