At the end of the 1400s and the start of the 1500s, most of Europe was moving toward a more stable government than it had for a long time. With more security, people started to work harder and improve their lives. As people got richer, they wanted more fancy things, including precious metals like silver. More wealthy people meant there was a greater need for silver items and decorations. 

It’s likely that many silver mines supplying Europe were running low and getting harder to work. Some of these mines had been used since Roman times. 

Most writers who studied prices of goods from long ago believe that from the time of the Conquest, maybe even since Julius Caesar invaded, the value of silver kept going down until the discovery of American mines. They think this because they noticed changes in the prices of things like corn and other basic goods. They also believed that as the amount of silver in a country goes up with more wealth, its value goes down.

When looking at corn prices, three things often confused them. First, in ancient times, most rents were paid with actual goods like corn, cattle, or chickens. Sometimes, landlords would say they could choose to take either the goods or a certain amount of money instead. The price for this choice is called the conversion price. Since landlords can pick either option, the conversion price usually has to be lower than the average market price to protect the tenant. In many places, it’s often less than half of the market price. 

In Scotland, this practice still happens with chickens and sometimes cattle. It might have continued with corn too, but public fiars changed that. Public fiars are yearly evaluations that set the average price of different types of grain based on actual market prices in each county. This made it safer for tenants and much easier for everyone involved.
