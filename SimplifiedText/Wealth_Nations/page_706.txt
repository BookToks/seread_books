If someone inherited land and they were a kid, all the money from that land went to the person in charge, except for what was needed to take care of the kid and pay the widow if there was one. When the kid grew up, they still had to pay a tax called relief, which was usually about a year’s rent. Back then, if a kid was a minor for a long time, it didn’t help the family’s wealth; instead, it often caused the land to lose value.

According to old laws, a vassal couldn’t sell their land without getting permission from the person above them. This person usually charged a fee for giving that permission. At first, this fee was random, but over time, it became a set percentage of the land's selling price in many places. In some areas, even though most old feudal rules are gone, this fee still brings in a lot of money for the government. For example, in Berne, the fee can be as high as one-sixth of the price for noble lands and one-tenth for regular lands. In Lucern, the fee only applies in certain areas, and if someone sells their land to move away, they pay ten percent of the sale price.

Many other countries have similar taxes on land sales, which help the government earn money. These sales can also be taxed in different ways, like through stamp duties or registration fees, which might depend on how much the land is worth.

In Great Britain, stamp duties vary based on the type of document, not really on the property's value. For example, a small stamp can be used for big money deals. The highest fees are about six pounds for each page of paper, mostly for official documents from the crown or certain legal actions. There aren’t any fees for registering documents, just small payments for the people who manage the register, which usually just cover their work. The crown doesn’t make money from these registrations.

In Holland, there are both stamp duties and registration fees.
