In big cities, businesses usually make less money than in small towns because there are more competitors and more money needed to run the business. However, people in big cities often get paid more for their work than those in small towns. In a busy city, companies with a lot of money sometimes can’t find enough workers, so they compete to hire them, which drives up wages but lowers profits. In the countryside, there often isn’t enough money to hire everyone, so workers compete for jobs, which lowers wages and increases profits.

In Scotland, even though the official interest rate is the same as in England, the actual market rate is a bit higher. People with good credit usually borrow money at five percent interest. Private banks in Edinburgh pay four percent interest on notes that can be cashed in anytime. In London, private banks don’t pay any interest on deposits. Many businesses in Scotland can operate with less money than in England, so profits are usually a bit higher there. However, wages are lower in Scotland compared to England, and the country is poorer and seems to be improving more slowly.

In France, the legal interest rate hasn’t always matched the market rate. For example, in 1720, interest was cut from five percent to two percent, then raised again a few years later. These changes were sometimes made to help reduce public debt. Today, France might not be as wealthy as England, and even though the legal interest rate is often lower, the market rate is usually higher because people find ways around the law. British merchants who have traded there have shared this information.
