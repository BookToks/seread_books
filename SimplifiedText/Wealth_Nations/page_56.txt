Adam Smith

The market price of things can go up and down based on rules and policies. Even if the price of something stays high for a while, it usually can’t stay low for too long. If the price is lower than what it should be, the people affected will notice the loss right away. They will either stop using as much land, labor, or resources for that product, which means there won’t be enough of it available. Because of this, the market price will quickly go back up to its natural price, especially if there are no restrictions.

Certain laws about jobs can help workers earn more money when a business is doing well. But when the business isn’t doing well, those same laws can force workers to accept lower wages. When things are going well, fewer people can get jobs, and when things are bad, workers can’t find many jobs either. However, the impact of these laws on lowering wages isn’t as strong as when they help raise them. While wages can be pushed up for a long time, the effects of lowering them usually don’t last as long. Once the older workers who were trained during good times are gone, new workers will adjust to what the market actually needs. It would take extreme rules, like those in ancient cultures where people had to stick to their family jobs, to keep wages or profits low for many years.

That’s all I want to say for now about how market prices can sometimes be different from natural prices. The natural price can change based on the natural rates of wages, profits, and rent. These rates also change depending on whether a society is rich or poor, or if it’s getting better, staying the same, or getting worse. In the next few chapters, I will explain the reasons behind these changes.

First, I will talk about what factors naturally decide how much workers get paid and how these factors are influenced by whether society is rich or poor, or if it’s improving, stable, or declining.
