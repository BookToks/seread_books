Adam Smith talks about how important education is for women and men. For women, education helps them become good at managing a household and acting properly when they take on that role. Women benefit from their education throughout their lives.

On the other hand, men often don’t get much use out of the hard parts of their education. This raises a question: Should society care about educating everyone? If so, what kind of education should different groups of people get, and how should it be provided?

Sometimes, society naturally helps people develop the skills and qualities they need without any help from the government. But in other cases, if society doesn’t support people, they might end up struggling and losing their potential.

As jobs become more specialized, many workers end up doing just a few simple tasks, often just one or two. This means that most people’s minds are shaped by their everyday jobs. If someone spends their whole life doing the same simple tasks, they don’t have to think much or come up with new ideas. Over time, this makes them less smart and less aware.

When someone’s mind isn’t active, they can’t enjoy or participate in meaningful conversations. They also struggle to understand important feelings and make good decisions in everyday life. They can’t judge what’s happening in their country and, without special training, they wouldn’t be able to defend it in a war. Living a boring, repetitive life can make them scared of the unpredictable and exciting life of a soldier. It even affects their physical ability, making them less capable of working hard in any job other than the one they know.
