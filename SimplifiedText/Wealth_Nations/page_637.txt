The Wealth of Nations

In a way, some jobs make people lose their smarts, social skills, and fighting abilities. In a better society, the working class, which is most of the people, will end up like this unless the government does something to stop it.

In more primitive societies, like those of hunters, shepherds, and early farmers, things are different. In these societies, everyone has to do different jobs, which forces them to think and come up with solutions to problems that keep popping up. This keeps their creativity alive and stops them from becoming lazy and dumb, which often happens in more advanced societies.

In these so-called primitive societies, every man is a fighter. They also have to think about how their society works and how their leaders are doing. Everyone can see how good their leaders are at keeping peace or leading in battle. In these societies, no one can really develop the deep understanding that some people have in more advanced societies. While there’s a lot of different jobs for each person, there isn’t much variety in what the whole society does. Most people can do almost everything that anyone else can do. Everyone has some knowledge and creativity, but not many people are experts. However, the level of skill they have is usually enough to handle the simple needs of their society.

In a more advanced society, even though most people have similar jobs, there are countless different jobs overall. These different jobs give a lot of things for a few people, who don’t have a specific job, to think about. Looking at so many different things helps them think deeply and make connections, making their understanding really sharp and broad. But unless these few people are in special situations, their talents, while impressive, might not really help the government or happiness of their society. Even with their skills, many important parts of being human can still be lacking.
