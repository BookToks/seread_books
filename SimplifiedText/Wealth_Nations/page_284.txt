Adam Smith talks about how certain places, like Versailles in France and Stowe in England, are really special and make their countries look good. Italy also has a lot of impressive buildings, even though it doesn't have the same wealth it used to have.

When someone spends money on things that last a long time, it can help them save money in the long run. If someone spends too much, they can cut back without worrying about what others think. For example, if they reduce the number of servants or stop having fancy dinners, people might notice and think they did something wrong. Because of this, many people who overspend don’t change their ways until they really have to, like when they run out of money. But if someone spends a lot on things like building a house or buying furniture, it's okay for them to stop spending more without anyone judging them. It looks like they just decided they have enough.

Also, spending on things that last usually helps more people than throwing big parties. At a huge feast, a lot of food can end up wasted. But if that money went to hiring builders or workers, more people would get to buy food and nothing would go to waste. This way, the money helps people who work and create things, which is better for the economy.

However, I’m not saying that spending on parties is always worse than spending on lasting things. When a wealthy person spends a lot on hospitality, they are sharing their money with others.
