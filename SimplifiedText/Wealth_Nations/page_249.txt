The Wealth of Nations

The money that people get back from their investments often takes a long time to match what they spent. For example, if someone is building an iron forge, they need a lot of money to set up the buildings and equipment. The same goes for someone who is running a mine or improving land. They have to spend money on things like digging, building roads, and making the land usable. 

Usually, the money spent on these big projects takes a long time to come back, much longer than what banks usually want. While business owners can borrow money for their projects, they need to make sure they have enough of their own money to protect the lenders. This way, even if the project doesn’t go as planned, the lenders are less likely to lose their money.

When borrowing money for a long time, it’s better to get it from private lenders instead of banks. Private lenders are often okay with waiting for their money back because they want to earn interest without doing the work themselves. Banks, on the other hand, might not be the best option for these kinds of loans because they have different rules and expectations.

For over 25 years, the paper money from Scottish banks has been more than enough for what people in the country need. These banks have already helped many traders and business owners in Scotland as much as possible.
