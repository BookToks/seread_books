It's way more expensive to build up a town to defend against powerful weapons today. There are many reasons why protecting society costs more now. One big reason is the huge change in how wars are fought, which started with the invention of gunpowder.

In modern warfare, the high cost of guns gives a clear advantage to the country that can afford them. This means rich and developed countries have an edge over poorer, less developed ones. In the past, wealthy and advanced societies struggled to defend themselves against poorer, more savage groups. Now, it's the opposite; the poorer groups find it hard to defend against the rich and civilized nations. Even though guns seem dangerous, they actually help keep civilization stable and help it grow.

The second job of a government is to protect everyone in society from unfair treatment by others and to make sure justice is served. This job costs different amounts depending on how advanced a society is.

In hunter societies, there isn’t much property, so there aren’t many judges or systems for justice. People without property can only hurt each other physically or damage their reputations. When someone hurts another person, the attacker doesn’t gain anything. But when it comes to property, the person who causes harm often benefits from it. The reasons people hurt each other usually come from feelings like jealousy or anger, but most people don’t feel those emotions all the time. Even the worst people only act on those feelings occasionally.
