Adam Smith says that richer countries usually grow more food because they have better land. But the extra food they produce isn't always much more than what poorer countries can grow. In farming, the work done in rich countries isn't always way better than in poor ones. So, the corn from a rich country might not always be cheaper than corn from a poor country. For example, the corn from Poland can be just as cheap as corn from France, even though France is richer and more developed.

In France, the corn is just as good and often costs about the same as corn from England, even though France might not be as wealthy as England. The farmland in England is better taken care of than in France, and France's farmland is better than Poland's. But even if a poorer country can sometimes match a richer country in the quality and price of corn, it can't compete in making things, especially if those products fit better with the rich country's resources. For instance, France makes better and cheaper silk than England because the climate in France is better for growing silk. However, England makes better and cheaper tools and wool than France.

Poland doesnâ€™t have many factories, just some basic household items that every country needs to survive. 

The big increase in how much work people can do comes from three main reasons. First, workers get better at their jobs. Second, they save time by not switching between different tasks. Lastly, there are many machines that help make work easier and let one person do the job of several people.

When workers get better at what they do, they can produce more. The division of labor helps because it allows each worker to focus on one simple task, making them really good at it. For example, a regular blacksmith might be good at using a hammer, but if he has to make nails for the first time, he won't be very skilled at it.
