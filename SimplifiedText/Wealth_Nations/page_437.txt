Nations often buy foreign goods at higher prices than they would if they allowed free competition from other countries. When a country uses its own products to buy foreign goods, it has to sell those products for less money. This is because when you trade two things, if one is cheaper, the other has to be more expensive. So, every trade agreement can lower the value of what a country produces. 

However, this drop in value usually doesn’t mean a real loss; it just means the country makes less profit than it could have. Even if they sell their goods for less, they won’t sell them for less than what they cost to make. If they did, they wouldn’t be able to keep trading for long. So, even the country that benefits from the trade might still gain something, but not as much as it would without restrictions.

Some trade agreements are thought to be good for different reasons. Sometimes, a country might agree to let another country sell certain goods exclusively because it believes it will sell more than it buys overall. This way, it expects to get more gold and silver back. For example, the trade agreement between England and Portugal in 1703 is often praised for this reason. 

This agreement has three main points. 

First, the King of Portugal promised to always allow British wool and wool products into Portugal, just like before, until they were banned by law.

Second, the Queen of Great Britain promised to always allow Portuguese wines into Britain. No extra taxes or fees would be charged on these wines, no matter if there was peace or war between Britain and France.
