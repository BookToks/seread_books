The Wealth of Nations

The power of the church leaders is strong, but sometimes the king needs to keep things calm and protect himself. He can’t always go against what the church decides, so he needs to find a way to influence them. He does this by making the church leaders worry about losing their jobs or by giving them hope for better positions.

In all Christian churches, the jobs of the clergy are like secure positions that they keep for life or as long as they behave well. If they could be easily fired for any small mistake by the king or his helpers, it would be hard for them to keep the trust of the people. The people would see them as just following the king and wouldn’t believe what they say anymore. But if the king tries to forcefully take away their positions because they are promoting ideas he doesn’t like, it would only make those leaders and their ideas more popular and harder to deal with.

Using fear to control people usually doesn’t work well, especially with those who want to be independent. Trying to scare them only makes them more upset and likely to resist. A kinder approach might make them more willing to cooperate. For example, in France, when the government tried to force their courts to accept unpopular laws, it rarely worked, even when they imprisoned members who disagreed. The Stuart kings in England tried similar tactics to control parliament but found it didn’t work either. Nowadays, the English parliament is run differently, and a small test done by the Duke of Choiseul on the Paris parliament showed that the French parliaments could have been managed more easily too. But they didn’t follow through with that idea. It’s clear that managing and persuading people is always a better way to go.
