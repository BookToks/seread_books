Spain and Portugal have a lot of gold and silver because they own the mines. This means they can sell these metals for less money than other countries can. So, you’d think gold and silver should be cheaper there than anywhere else in Europe. The price difference should only be about shipping costs, which are not that high for these valuable metals.

However, Spain and Portugal make it hard for other countries to buy their gold and silver. Spain puts taxes on exports, and Portugal doesn’t allow them to be exported at all. This makes it more expensive to smuggle these metals out, which raises their prices in other countries. It’s like when you block a river with a dam; once the dam is full, the water just flows over. 

No matter what, Spain and Portugal can only keep as much gold and silver as they can use for things like coins and jewelry. Once they reach that limit, any extra has to go out. Even with these rules, the amount of gold and silver they export is almost the same as what they bring in each year. 

But because of the rules, there’s usually more gold and silver in Spain and Portugal compared to other countries when you look at how much they produce from their land and work. The stricter the rules and taxes are, the bigger the difference becomes. People say you can find a lot of fancy silverware in homes there, even if the rest of the house isn’t as nice as what you’d see in other countries. This makes gold and silver cheaper, which makes everything else more expensive.
