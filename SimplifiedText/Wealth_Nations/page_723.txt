The old tax, called the subsidy, is still being collected based on a set of rules from a long time ago. This way of figuring out how much tax to charge on goods has been around since before King James I. A new tax was added during the time of King William III, which added an extra five percent on most goods. There were also two other types of subsidies that together added another five percent. In 1747, another five percent tax was added, and in 1759, a fifth one was added for specific goods. Besides these five taxes, there have been many other charges on certain goods to help the government or to control trade in the country.

This system of taxes has become more popular over time. The old tax was applied to both goods being sent out of the country and those coming in. The later taxes and other charges have mostly only been applied to goods coming into the country. Many of the old taxes on goods made in the country have been reduced or removed completely. In fact, many have been taken away. Sometimes, the government even gives money back for sending some goods out of the country. When goods are imported, only half of the old tax is refunded when they are sent back out, but most of the newer taxes are fully refunded for exported goods. 

This trend of encouraging exports and discouraging imports has a few exceptions, especially for materials used in manufacturing. Merchants and manufacturers want these materials to be as cheap as possible for them and as expensive as possible for their competitors in other countries. Because of this, some materials can be brought in without any tax, like Spanish wool and raw linen yarn. However, exporting materials made in the country or from the colonies has sometimes been banned or taxed more heavily. For example, exporting English wool is not allowed, and exporting beaver skins and other specific materials has higher taxes because Great Britain controls a lot of these products.
