The Wealth of Nations

Managing the colonies is really hard because they have different leaders, locations, and rules. Even if the British government wanted to control them all the same way, they just can’t. It’s impossible to give important jobs to the leaders of all the colonies in a way that would make them want to raise taxes on their people to support the British government, especially when most of the money would go to people they don’t even know. 

Also, the British government wouldn’t really know how important each colony is or what they need. They would make mistakes trying to manage them all. Each colony can handle its own local issues, but they can’t decide what’s best for the entire empire. They don’t have the right information to understand how their colony fits into the bigger picture or how rich or important they are compared to others. Only a group that looks after the whole empire can figure out what’s needed for everyone’s defense and how much each part should contribute.

So, it was suggested that the colonies should be taxed based on what the British Parliament decides. They would figure out how much each colony should pay, and then the local assembly would collect it in a way that works for them. This way, the overall needs of the empire would be handled by the main government, while each colony could still manage its own local matters. Even if the colonies didn’t have representatives in the British Parliament, it’s likely that the tax requests wouldn’t be unfair. The British Parliament hasn’t been unreasonable in the past.
