The rent for land is basically the highest amount a tenant can pay based on the land's situation. When setting up a lease, the landlord tries to make sure the tenant keeps just enough of the crops to cover the costs of seeds, labor, and taking care of animals and tools. This amount is the minimum the tenant can accept without losing money, and the landlord usually doesn’t want to give them more than that. Any extra crops or money from selling them is what the landlord wants as rent, which is the most the tenant can afford given the land's conditions.

Sometimes, landlords might be generous or just not know better, so they might accept a little less rent. On rare occasions, a tenant might pay more or be okay with less than what’s typical for farming in that area. But generally, the amount they can afford is seen as the natural rent for the land.

People might think that rent is just a fair profit for the money the landlord spent to improve the land. While that can be true sometimes, it’s usually not the whole story. Landlords ask for rent even for land that hasn’t been improved, and any profit from improvements is usually added to the original rent. Also, improvements aren’t always made by the landlord; sometimes, the tenant does them. When the lease is up for renewal, the landlord often wants to raise the rent as if they did all the improvements themselves.

Sometimes, landlords even charge rent for land that can’t be improved at all. For example, kelp is a type of seaweed that grows on rocks covered by the sea. It can be burned to make things like glass and soap. This kelp grows naturally and isn’t made better by human work. Still, the landlord who owns the land where this kelp grows wants to charge rent for it.
