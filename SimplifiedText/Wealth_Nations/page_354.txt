Adam Smith talks about how countries can fight expensive wars without needing to send a lot of gold and silver to other places. Instead, they might have to send out a lot of their products without getting anything back for the country, even though merchants do benefit. The government buys bills from these merchants to pay for the army's salaries and supplies. 

During the war, manufacturers will have to make more goods to send abroad to pay for the army, and they also need to make products for people back home. So, even in a tough foreign war, many factories can do really well. But when peace returns, those factories might start to struggle. Sometimes, factories can thrive while their country is in trouble, and then start to fail when things get better. 

In the past, it was hard for countries to keep fighting long wars by just sending out raw materials from their farms. It would cost too much to send enough to pay for an army. Plus, most countries only grow enough food for their own people, so sending a lot away would mean they don’t have enough to eat at home. 

On the other hand, sending out manufactured goods is different. The workers who make these products stay at home, and only the extra stuff gets sent out. Mr. Hume pointed out that ancient English kings struggled to keep long wars going because they didn’t have enough to pay for their armies. They could only send out raw materials, which they needed for their own people, or some basic products that were too expensive to transport. This problem wasn’t because they didn’t have money; it was because they lacked better-made products. Back then, buying and selling still happened with money, just like today. The amount of money in circulation matched the number of purchases and sales that were happening at that time.
