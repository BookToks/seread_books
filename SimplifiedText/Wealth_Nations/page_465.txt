The Wealth of Nations

The prices of European goods in the colonies aren’t super high, even though there’s some competition. 

When it comes to selling their extra products, the colonies of Great Britain can only sell certain items to the mother country. These specific items are listed in the navigation laws and are called enumerated commodities. The other items, known as non-enumerated commodities, can be sold directly to other countries, as long as they are shipped on British or plantation ships, which must have British owners and three-fourths of the crew must be British too.

Some important non-enumerated commodities include grains, lumber, salt, fish, sugar, and rum. 

Grain is usually the main crop for new colonies. The law helps them sell a lot of it, which encourages them to grow more than what a small population would need. This way, they can prepare for a growing population.

In places with lots of trees, timber isn’t worth much because it’s everywhere. The main problem is clearing the land to use it. The law helps by giving colonies a big market for their lumber, which raises its price and helps them make some money instead of just spending it.

In a country that isn’t very populated or farmed, cattle can multiply quickly and aren’t worth much. But it’s important for the price of cattle to be related to the price of corn so that land can be improved. The law allows American cattle to be sold widely, which helps raise their value. However, a law from King George III makes hides and skins part of the enumerated commodities, which can lower the value of American cattle.

The government seems to want to boost Great Britain’s shipping and naval power by expanding the fishing industries in the colonies. Because of this, the fisheries have received a lot of support and have done really well. The New England fishery, in particular, was thriving before recent troubles.
