The Wealth of Nations

When the government gets money from people, it keeps getting more and more as long as it exists. However, it can’t create something as easy to transfer as a perpetual annuity, which is a type of investment that stays valuable over time.

In France, since the government isn’t based in a big trading city, there aren’t as many merchants lending money to it. Instead, most of the people who lend money are involved in finances, like tax collectors and bankers. These people often come from regular backgrounds but have a lot of money and pride. They usually don’t want to marry someone of their own social status, and wealthy women often look down on them. Because of this, many choose to stay single. They don’t have families to worry about and don’t care much for their relatives, so they just want to live lavishly while they can, even if their wealth doesn’t continue after they die. There are more rich people in France who either don’t want to marry or can’t marry because of their lifestyle compared to England. For these people, it’s really convenient to trade their money for a steady income that lasts only as long as they want.

Most modern governments spend about as much money as they make during peaceful times. But when war happens, they don’t want to raise taxes too much because they fear it will upset the people. They also don’t know what taxes would be enough to cover the extra expenses. Borrowing money helps them avoid these problems. By borrowing, they can get enough money for the war with only a small increase in taxes. This way, they can fund the war while keeping taxes low. In big countries, people living in the capital and far from the fighting often don’t feel the effects of the war much. They can relax and read about their armies in the news. For them, the entertainment they get from reading about the war makes up for the slight increase in taxes compared to when there’s peace.
