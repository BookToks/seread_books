It seems like the music education of the Greeks didn’t really help them become better people, since the Romans, who didn’t have much music education, were generally better in that way. The old wise guys respected their traditions and probably thought there was a lot of political wisdom in what was just an old custom that had been passed down over time.

Music and dancing were the main fun activities for almost all early societies, and they were seen as important skills for anyone who wanted to entertain others. This is still true today for some groups, like the people living on the coast of Africa. It was also true for ancient Celtic and Scandinavian people, and even the Greeks before the Trojan War. When the Greek tribes became small republics, it made sense that learning these skills became part of the public education for everyone.

The teachers who helped young people learn music or military skills didn’t seem to get paid or appointed by the government in either Rome or Athens, which is the Greek city we know the most about. The government wanted every free citizen to be ready to defend the city in war, so they had to learn military skills. But it was up to them to find teachers, and the government only provided a public space for practice.

In the early days of the Greek and Roman republics, education mostly involved learning to read, write, and do basic math. Wealthier citizens often learned these skills at home with the help of a tutor, who was usually a slave or a freedman. Poorer citizens went to schools run by teachers who charged for lessons.

There was a law by Solon that said children didn’t have to support parents who didn’t teach them a useful trade.

As society got more advanced, philosophy and rhetoric became popular, and wealthier families started sending their kids to schools to learn these subjects. But these schools weren’t funded by the government. For a long time,
