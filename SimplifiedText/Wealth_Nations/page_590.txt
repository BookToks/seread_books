Adam Smith talks about how important public works are for helping trade in society. 

First, he explains that things like good roads, bridges, canals, and harbors are necessary for making commerce easier. The cost to build and keep these public works can change a lot depending on how advanced a society is. For example, as a country produces more goods, the need for better roads and bridges increases. A bridge needs to be strong enough for the number of vehicles that will cross it. Canals need to be deep enough for the boats that will carry goods, and harbors must be big enough for the ships that will use them.

Smith believes that these public works donâ€™t always have to be paid for by the government. Instead, they can generate their own money. For example, a highway or bridge can charge a small fee (toll) to the vehicles using them. Harbors can charge ships a fee based on how much they carry. Other services, like coin production and post offices, can also make money while covering their costs.

When vehicles pay tolls based on their weight, they help pay for the upkeep of the roads and bridges they use. This seems like a fair way to maintain these public works. Even though the tolls are paid by the carriers, the cost eventually gets passed on to the consumers in the price of goods. However, since the cost of transporting goods is lowered, it helps everyone in the end.
