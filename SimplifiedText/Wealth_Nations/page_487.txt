The Wealth of Nations

The trade with America and the West Indies is usually less reliable and more unpredictable than trade with Europe or countries around the Mediterranean. Most people who know about these trades would agree with this.

Also, the control over trade with the colonies has sometimes pushed some of Britain's money away from direct trade with other countries into a more complicated trade system. 

For example, Maryland and Virginia send over 96,000 barrels of tobacco to Britain each year, but Britain only uses about 14,000 of those barrels. This means that over 82,000 barrels have to be sent to other countries like France and Holland. The money and resources used to bring those 82,000 barrels to Britain and then send them out again are tied up in this complicated trade. This is necessary to deal with the extra tobacco that Britain canâ€™t use.

If we think about how long it takes for this money to come back to Britain, we have to consider the distance from America and the other countries. In the direct trade with America, it often takes three or four years for the money to return. In this round-about trade, it might take four or five years. If the direct trade can keep one-third or one-fourth of British workers busy, the round-about trade can only keep one-fourth or one-fifth of them busy.

At some ports, they often give credit to foreign buyers of tobacco. In London, though, they usually require payment right away. The rule there is "Weigh and pay." So, the returns from this complicated trade take longer to come back than those from America.
