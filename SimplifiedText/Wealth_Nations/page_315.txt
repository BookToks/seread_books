The Wealth of Nations

Tobacco farms are not as good as sugar farms, but they are better than corn farms. Both types of farms can use slaves, but sugar farms can afford more slaves than tobacco farms. So, there are a lot more Black people working on sugar farms compared to tobacco farms.

In the past, slave farmers were replaced by a type of farmer called metayers in France. In Latin, they are known as Coloni Partiarii. In England, we don’t really have a name for them anymore. The landowner would give them seeds, animals, and tools to farm. When the crops were harvested, they would split the produce equally between the landowner and the farmer, after keeping what was needed to keep the farming equipment and animals in good shape. If the farmer left or was kicked out, the landowner would get back what they provided.

Land worked by these farmers is taken care of just like land worked by slaves. But there’s a big difference. These farmers are free and can own property. Since they get a share of the crops, they want to grow as much as possible to get more for themselves. On the other hand, a slave only gets enough to survive, so they might not work as hard to make the land produce more than what they need to eat.

This difference likely helped end slavery in most of Europe over time. The exact details of how this change happened are unclear. The Roman Catholic Church claims it played a big role. In the 12th century, Pope Alexander III encouraged freeing slaves, but it was more of a suggestion than a strict rule. Slavery continued for many years until it was slowly ended by the interests of landowners and rulers. A freed person who still worked the land but didn’t own anything could only farm with help from others.
