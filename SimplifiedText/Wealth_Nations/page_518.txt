Adam Smith

The East India Company wants to sell goods in Europe for a good profit. To do this, they try to keep other sellers out of the markets in the countries they control. This means they only let enough goods come from those countries to meet their own needs or to sell in Europe at a price they think is fair. Because of this, they often choose to make a small, quick profit instead of focusing on bigger, long-term gains for the country they govern. This can lead them to treat the countries they control like the Dutch treat the Moluccas.

As rulers, the East India Company wants European goods sold cheaply in India and Indian goods sold for a high price. But as merchants, their goals are the opposite. As rulers, their interests should match those of the country they control. But as merchants, their interests clash with those of the country.

The way they run things in India is even worse. Their government is made up of a group of merchants, which is a respected job, but it doesn’t have the power to make people obey without using force. They can only get people to follow them because they have military support, so their rule is strict and controlling. Their main job is to sell European goods and buy Indian goods for Europe. They want to sell the European goods for as much as possible and buy the Indian goods for as little as possible, which means they try to keep competitors out of their market.

This way of running things makes the government work for the company’s profit, which can limit how much the country can produce. The people in charge also trade for themselves, and it’s pointless to try to stop them from doing that. It’s really foolish to think you can control what they do.
