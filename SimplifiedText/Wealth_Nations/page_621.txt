The Wealth of Nations

Most of a teacher's income comes from the fees they get from their students. Even though they don’t have to work as hard as before, they still need to care about their reputation. How well they are liked and respected by their students matters. The best way for them to earn that respect is by doing their job well and putting in the effort.

In other schools, teachers aren’t allowed to take any money from their students, so their salary is all they get. This can create a conflict between what they want and what they need to do. Everyone wants to be comfortable, and if a teacher gets paid the same whether they work hard or not, they might choose to do less work. If they have to do their job, they might do it as carelessly as possible. If they like to stay busy, they might find other ways to use their energy that benefit them more than their teaching.

If the authority over the teacher comes from the college or university they belong to, and most of the other members are teachers too, they might all look out for each other. They could agree to let each other skip their responsibilities as long as they can do the same. For example, at Oxford University, many professors have stopped pretending to teach altogether.

If the authority comes from outside the school, like a bishop or a government official, the teacher probably can’t ignore their job completely. However, these higher-ups can only require them to teach a certain number of hours or give a set number of lectures. What those lectures cover still depends on how motivated the teacher is to prepare them. This outside authority can sometimes be clueless or unfair in how they enforce rules.
