The Wealth of Nations

Public works and institutions are important for helping businesses. They make it easier for trade to happen. However, to support specific types of trade, we need special institutions that cost a lot of money.

Some types of trade, especially with less developed countries, need extra protection. A regular store wouldn’t be safe enough for merchants trading on the western coast of Africa. To keep their goods safe from local dangers, they need a fortified place to store them. In India, where the government can be unstable, similar precautions are necessary. The English and French East India companies built forts there to protect their people and goods.

In countries where the government is strict and doesn’t allow outsiders to have strongholds, it’s important to have an ambassador or consul. This person can help resolve issues between their own countrymen and the locals, providing better protection than a regular person could. Trade often requires having ministers in foreign countries, even when there’s no war or alliance needed. For example, the Turkey company needed an ambassador in Constantinople because of trade. The first English embassies to Russia were also started for trade reasons.

The need to protect trade interests has led to the practice of having ambassadors in neighboring countries, even during peace. This idea is relatively new, starting around the late 1400s or early 1500s, when trade began to grow across Europe and nations started to pay attention to trade matters. It makes sense that the extra costs involved in this would be necessary.
