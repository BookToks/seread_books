Adam Smith

The new market is much bigger than the old one, and it keeps getting bigger every day. 

Countries that have colonies in America and trade with the East Indies really benefit from this big trade. But other countries, even with all the rules trying to keep them out, often get more real benefits from it. For example, the colonies of Spain and Portugal actually help other countries more than they help Spain and Portugal themselves. Just in linen, those colonies use over three million pounds worth every year. Most of that linen comes from France, Flanders, Holland, and Germany, while Spain and Portugal only provide a small amount. The money made from selling all that linen goes to people in those other countries. The profits from it are mostly spent in Spain and Portugal, where they help support the wealthy merchants in Cadiz and Lisbon.

Even the rules that each country makes to keep the trade for themselves often end up hurting them more than the countries they’re trying to keep out. When they try to limit other countries, it usually backfires and hurts their own businesses more. For example, a merchant in Hamburg has to send the linen he wants to sell in America to London first, and then he has to get tobacco from there to sell in Germany. Because of these rules, he might have to sell the linen for less and pay more for the tobacco than he would if he could trade directly. This means he makes less money. However, in the trade between Hamburg and London, he gets his money back much faster than he would if he traded directly with America, even if we assume that payments from America were as quick as those from London. So, even though the trade he’s stuck with might not make him as much money, it actually helps keep more German workers busy than if he could trade directly.
