The Wealth of Nations

Goods can only be brought to Britain on ships from the country where they are made. The people who own, run, and work on these ships must be from that country. If goods come on ships from other countries, there are heavy penalties, like losing the ship and the goods. When this law was created, the Dutch were the main traders in Europe, and this rule kept them from bringing goods to Britain or carrying goods from other European countries to us.

Also, many large items can't be brought to Britain unless they come from the country where they are made. If they do come from somewhere else, the ship and cargo can be taken away. This rule was likely made to stop the Dutch, who were the main suppliers of European goods at that time. It made it hard for British ships to pick up goods from Holland that came from other European countries.

Additionally, if salt fish, whale fins, whalebone, oil, or blubber are brought into Britain and weren't caught and processed on British ships, they face heavy taxes. The Dutch were the main fish suppliers in Europe, and this rule made it tough for them to sell fish to Britain.

When this navigation law was created, England and Holland weren't actually at war, but they really didn't like each other. This tension started during a time when the English Parliament was in charge and continued during the Dutch wars. Some of the rules in this law might have come from this dislike. However, they were smart rules that aimed to weaken Holland's navy, which was the only one that could threaten England's safety.

The navigation law doesn't help foreign trade or the wealth that can come from it. A country's goal in trade is like a merchant's goal: to buy low and sell high. A country is more likely to buy cheaply if it allows all nations to bring their goods freely.
