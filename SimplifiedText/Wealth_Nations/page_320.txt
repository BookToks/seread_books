After the Roman Empire fell, people living in cities and towns didnâ€™t have it any better than those in the countryside. The people in cities were very different from the original citizens of ancient Greece and Italy. The early citizens were mostly landowners who split up public land and built their homes close together for safety. 

But after the Roman Empire collapsed, landowners often lived in strong castles on their own land, surrounded by their workers. The towns were mainly filled with tradespeople and craftsmen, who were often treated like servants or were very close to that status. The special rights given to some towns in Europe show how low their status was before those rights were granted. 

For example, people were allowed to marry without asking their lord for permission, and when they died, their kids could inherit their stuff instead of their lord taking it. They could also decide what happened to their belongings in their will. Before these rights, they were almost in the same situation as the farmers in the countryside. 

These townspeople were often poor and moved around with their goods, similar to modern-day street vendors. In Europe back then, just like in some parts of Asia today, travelers had to pay taxes on their goods and themselves when passing through certain areas, crossing bridges, or setting up stalls at fairs. These taxes had names like passage, pontage, lastage, and stallage. Sometimes, the king or a powerful lord would give certain traders, especially those living on their own land, a break from these taxes. These traders, even if they were treated like servants in other ways, were called free traders because of this exemption. In return, they usually had to pay their protector a fee.
