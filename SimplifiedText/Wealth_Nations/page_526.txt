Our wool makers have done a great job convincing the government that the country's success relies on their business. They have managed to create rules that stop people from buying woolen clothes from other countries. They also made it illegal to sell live sheep and wool to other countries, which hurts sheep farmers.

Many people complain about the harsh laws made to protect the government’s money. These laws punish actions that used to be seen as okay before they were declared illegal. But the worst laws come from the pressure put on the government by merchants and manufacturers to protect their unfair advantages. These laws are extremely strict and unfair.

According to a law from Queen Elizabeth's time, if someone tried to export sheep or lambs, they would lose all their goods, go to jail for a year, and then have their left hand cut off in public. If they did it again, they could be sentenced to death. This law was meant to stop sheep from being bred in other countries. Another law from King Charles II made it a serious crime to export wool, with the same harsh punishments.

It’s hoped that these awful laws were never actually enforced. The first law has never been officially canceled, and some people think it might still be in effect. However, it might be considered canceled by a later law that imposes a fine for every sheep exported, along with taking away the sheep. The second law was officially canceled by a law from King William III, which recognized that the harsh penalties made it hard to catch offenders.
