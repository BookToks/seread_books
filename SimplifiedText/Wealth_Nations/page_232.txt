Adam Smith talks about how a society uses its resources. There are two main types of capital: fixed capital and circulating capital. Fixed capital includes things like buildings and machines, while circulating capital includes goods that can be used right away. 

When a society uses its goods, any part not needed for fixed capital goes towards what people can use right away. This means that taking care of these three parts of circulating capital doesn’t take away from what the society earns, except for what’s needed to maintain the fixed capital.

The way circulating capital works for a society is different from how it works for a single person. For an individual, their capital can’t be part of their earnings; it only includes their profits. But for a society, the circulating capital of each person contributes to the overall earnings of the society. For example, a merchant’s shop has goods that aren’t just for their own use. Other people can buy those goods and replace their value, plus some profit, without hurting anyone’s capital.

Money is the only part of circulating capital that can actually reduce the society's earnings when it’s being maintained. 

Fixed capital and the money in circulation are similar in how they affect a society's earnings. Both require money to set up and maintain. Just like machines and tools need money to build and keep running, the money that circulates in a country also needs money to collect and maintain. This money doesn’t directly help people enjoy their lives but is necessary for trading and getting what they need.

Lastly, just like machines and tools don’t add to the total earnings of a person or society, money itself doesn’t add to the total earnings either. It’s just a way to share the earnings among everyone in the society.
