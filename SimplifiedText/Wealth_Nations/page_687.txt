The Wealth of Nations

When it comes to collecting taxes, some people can easily keep an eye on everything. For example, a wealthy guy living in the city might lose a lot of money if he relies on others to collect rent from his land far away. If he can't see what's happening, he risks being cheated or missing out on money. The same goes for a king; if his tax collectors are careless, he could lose even more money. Sometimes, the people working for a regular person are watched more closely than those working for a king. If taxes were collected in goods instead of money, it could lead to a lot of mistakes, and most of the money wouldn’t even reach the king. In China, some taxes are still collected this way, and the tax collectors probably like it because it’s easier for them to take advantage of the system.

When land taxes are paid in money, they can be based on the current market value or a fixed price. For example, a bushel of wheat might always be valued the same, no matter how the market changes. If the tax is based on market value, it will change depending on how much the land produces and how well it's taken care of. But if it’s a fixed price, the tax amount might not match the actual value of what the land produces at different times.

If instead of paying a portion of what the land produces or its price, a specific amount of money is paid as tax, it works like the land tax in England. This means the tax doesn’t change with the rent of the land, and it doesn’t encourage or discourage improvements. In many areas that pay a fixed tax instead of other types, it works like this. During the time when the Muslims ruled Bengal, instead of taking a fifth of the crops, they used a fixed tax that was said to be quite reasonable.
