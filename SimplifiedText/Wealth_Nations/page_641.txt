A person who is mentally messed up is just as damaged as someone who is physically hurt. In fact, the person with a troubled mind is usually more unhappy. Happiness and sadness come from our minds, so how our minds work is more important than how our bodies are. 

Even if a strong spirit doesn’t help protect society, it’s still important for the government to make sure people don’t become cowardly. Cowardice can spread and make everyone feel worse, just like a nasty disease that isn’t deadly but still needs to be controlled to keep people healthy.

The same goes for ignorance and stupidity that often hold back people in society. A person who can’t think properly is even more looked down upon than a coward. Even if the government doesn’t gain anything from teaching less fortunate people, it’s still important that they learn something. 

In fact, the government benefits a lot from educating everyone. When people know more, they are less likely to fall for crazy ideas and superstitions that can cause big problems. Educated people are usually more respectful and behave better than those who are not. They feel more confident and are more likely to earn respect from others. 

They also think more critically and can see through lies and complaints that are just meant to stir up trouble. Because of this, they are less likely to oppose the government for no good reason. In free countries, where the government relies on the people's opinions, it’s super important that people don’t judge the government without thinking carefully.
