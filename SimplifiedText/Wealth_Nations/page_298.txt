Adam Smith talks about how the value of a country's goods comes from how well it uses its land and workers. After farming, the money spent on making things (manufacturing) helps the country the most by creating jobs and adding value to what they produce. The money used for selling goods to other countries is the least helpful of the three.

If a country doesn’t have enough money to do all three things—farming, manufacturing, and trading—it hasn’t reached its full potential. Trying to do all three too soon, without enough money, isn’t the best way for a country or a person to get rich. Just like a person, a country has limits on how much money it can use, and it can only do certain things with that money. A country’s total money grows when people save part of what they earn.

A country’s money grows fastest when it’s used in ways that help everyone earn more, so they can save more. The total money people have is tied to how much their land and labor produce each year.

One big reason why the American colonies got rich quickly is that they focused mostly on farming. They don’t have many factories, except for some small ones run by families. Most of the goods that are sold in America come from merchants in Great Britain. Even the stores in places like Virginia and Maryland are often owned by British merchants, which is unusual because usually, local people run retail businesses.

If Americans tried to stop buying European goods and only bought from their own people, thinking it would help them, they would actually slow down their growth and make it harder for their country to get rich. This would be even worse if they tried to keep all their business to themselves.
