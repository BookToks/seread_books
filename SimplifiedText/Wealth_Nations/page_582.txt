Adam Smith talks about how some people are seen as better or more important than others. This difference creates a natural order where some people have power over others. 

In groups of shepherds, this idea is really strong. The top shepherd, who is wealthy and has many people relying on him, is respected because of his money and his family's history. He has power over the other shepherds in his group because he can gather more people and has a stronger military force. When thereâ€™s a war, everyone wants to follow him instead of someone else. His wealth and status give him a kind of power to lead.

When someone in the group does something wrong, the top shepherd can make them fix it because he has more people backing him up. The weaker shepherds look to him for help and protection. If they feel wronged, they go to him to complain, and he can handle the situation better than anyone else could. His position gives him some authority to judge what happens.

In the early days of shepherds, we start to see differences in wealth, which creates a system where some people have more power than others. This setup leads to a kind of government that helps keep things in order. Even though this system seems to happen naturally, it also becomes important for keeping that order. Wealthy people want to maintain this system because it protects their riches. 

Shepherds with less wealth team up to support the richer ones, hoping that the rich will do the same for them. They realize that their own safety depends on the big shepherd's safety. If the big shepherd is strong, they can keep their own flocks safe, and their own power depends on following him.
