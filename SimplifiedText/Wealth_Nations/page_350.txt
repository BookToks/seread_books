Adam Smith talks about how the amount of money (like coins) in a country depends on how much stuff people want to buy and sell. If the value of things goes up, people will need more money, and they might get it from other countries. 

He also says that the amount of fancy things, like silver plates, depends on how many rich families want them. If more families get richer, they will likely buy more fancy stuff. Trying to make a country richer by bringing in extra gold and silver is pointless, just like trying to make a family happier by forcing them to buy more kitchen tools they don’t need. Buying too many kitchen tools would just waste money and not help with food.

Gold and silver are just tools, like kitchen items. If you use them more, you’ll need more things to buy and sell. But if you try to force more gold and silver into the country, it won’t help and might even make things worse. If there’s too much gold and silver that people don’t use, they’ll just send it away to another country.

You don’t always need a lot of gold and silver to pay for wars or to have armies far away. Armies are paid with goods that people can use. A country can support its army by using what it makes each year, like food and other products. 

A country can pay for its army in three ways: by sending some of its saved gold and silver, by sending products it makes, or by sending raw materials it produces.
