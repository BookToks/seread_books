The Wealth of Nations

Land could have been split up into smaller pieces again, either when someone died or when it was sold. The law of primogeniture stopped it from being divided when someone passed away, and the law of entails kept it from being sold off in pieces.

When land is seen just as a way to live and enjoy life, the natural law says it should be shared equally among all the kids in the family. This was how the Romans did it; they didnâ€™t care if the kids were older or younger, or if they were boys or girls, when it came to inheriting land. But when land became a source of power and protection, it was better for it to go to just one person. Back then, big landowners acted like mini-kings. Their tenants were like their subjects. The landowner made the rules and led them in battles. The safety of a piece of land depended on how big it was. If it got divided, it could be easily taken over by neighbors.

Over time, the law of primogeniture became important for passing down land, just like it did for monarchies. To keep the power and safety of a monarchy strong, it had to go to one child. Choosing which child gets it should be based on clear rules, not personal opinions. The only clear differences among siblings are usually gender and age. Boys are generally preferred over girls, and older siblings usually get priority over younger ones. This is how the right of primogeniture started.

Laws often stick around long after the reasons for them have disappeared. Today in Europe, even someone who owns just a small piece of land is as secure as someone who owns a huge estate. Still, the law of primogeniture is respected, and it helps maintain family pride.
