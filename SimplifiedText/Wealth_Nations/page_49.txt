Most farmers own their land, so we usually hear about how much money they make instead of how much they pay for rent. Regular farmers don’t usually hire someone to manage their farms. They often do a lot of the work themselves, like plowing and planting. After paying rent, the money left over should cover the costs of what they used to grow the crops and also pay them for their work. The leftover money is called profit, but it also includes their wages. By not paying someone else, farmers save money, which means they make more profit. 

A manufacturer who has enough money to buy materials and support themselves until they sell their products should earn both the wages of a worker and the profit that the boss makes from selling that worker’s products. However, people usually just call all of that profit, mixing wages in with it.

A gardener who grows their own food does all three jobs: they own the land, farm it, and do the labor. So, the food they grow should pay for the rent of the land, the profit from farming, and their wages for working. But people often just see all of that as the money they make from their work, mixing rent and profit with wages.

In a developed country, most things we trade for aren’t just valued by the work put into them; rent and profit also play a big role. The total amount of work done each year can buy a lot more labor than what was used to create and sell those products. If society used all the labor it could buy each year, the amount of work would grow a lot every year, and the value of what’s produced would be much higher than the year before. But in every country, not all the yearly production goes to support workers. Lazy people use up a big part of it, and depending on how this production is shared between workers and non-workers, its value will either go up, down, or stay the same from year to year.
