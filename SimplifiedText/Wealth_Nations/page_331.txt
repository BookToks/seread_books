The Wealth of Nations

Back in the day, the rich and powerful people, from kings to small landowners, had way more wealth than we can imagine today. Westminster Hall was like a big dining room for King William Rufus, and it was often crowded with guests.

Thomas Becket was known for making his dining hall fancy by covering the floor with clean hay or rushes. This way, the knights and squires who didn’t have seats could sit on the floor without ruining their nice clothes while eating. The Earl of Warwick was said to host around 30,000 people every day at his different estates. Even if that number is a bit exaggerated, it shows he had a lot of guests. A similar kind of hospitality was found in the Highlands of Scotland not too long ago. It seems like this kind of generosity is common in places where people don’t know much about trade and manufacturing. Doctor Pocock even saw an Arabian chief invite everyone, including beggars, to join him for dinner in the streets when he came to sell his cattle.

The people who worked the land were just as dependent on the wealthy landowners as their servants were. Even those who weren’t considered slaves were still tenants who paid very little rent compared to what they got from the land. In the Highlands of Scotland, people used to pay a crown, half a crown, or even a sheep or lamb as rent for land that could support a family. In some areas, this is still true today, and money doesn’t buy more goods there than in other places.

In a situation where a big estate produces more than it needs, the owner might prefer that some of that food is eaten away from his house. This way, he doesn’t have to deal with a huge crowd at home. A tenant who has enough land to support his family but pays very little rent is just as dependent on the landowner as any servant. The landowner feeds both his servants and his tenants, and their ability to survive relies on his generosity.

The power that wealthy landowners had over their tenants and servants allowed them to become the judges and leaders in their areas. They could keep the peace and lead in battles for everyone living on their land.
