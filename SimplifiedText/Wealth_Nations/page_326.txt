Adam Smith

The big wars that happened when people tried to take over the Holy Land slowed down progress in most of Europe but actually helped some Italian cities grow. The huge armies that came from everywhere needed ships to transport them and bring them food, which was a big boost for places like Venice, Genoa, and Pisa. These cities acted like suppliers for the armies, and while the wars were terrible for most of Europe, they made these cities wealthy.

People in trading cities brought in fancy goods and luxuries from richer countries, which made the wealthy landowners happy. They bought these goods with a lot of the basic products they produced on their own land. Back then, much of Europe traded their raw materials for the manufactured goods from more advanced nations. For example, England traded its wool for French wine and fine cloth from Flanders, just like Poland today trades its grain for French wines and Italian silks.

This interest in better-made products came from foreign trade and spread to countries that didn’t make these things themselves. When more people wanted these products, merchants tried to set up their own factories to make them locally to save on shipping costs. This is how the first factories for selling goods far away started in Western Europe after the Roman Empire fell.

It’s important to note that no big country can survive without some kind of manufacturing. When people say a country has no manufactures, they usually mean it doesn’t have the fancy or improved products that can be sold far away. In large countries, most of the clothing and furniture for regular people comes from local production. This is even more true in poorer countries that are said to have no manufacturing compared to richer ones. In rich countries, you’ll often find that even the poorest people have more foreign-made clothes and furniture than in poorer countries.

Manufactured goods that can be sold far away came to different countries in two main ways. Sometimes they were introduced through the strong influence of trade.
