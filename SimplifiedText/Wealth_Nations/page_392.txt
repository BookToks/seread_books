Adam Smith believed that England would make the most money from trade. For example, if England only bought things from France that France makes and didn’t have anything to sell that France wanted, England would send a lot of foreign goods, like tobacco and stuff from East India, to pay for it. This trade would help both countries, but France would benefit more than England. 

Most of the money used in this trade would go to people in France, while only the money used to make the English goods would go to people in England. A lot of the money would go back to places like Virginia, India, and China, which would help the people there too. If both countries had about the same amount of money involved, France would end up making a lot more money than England. In this case, France would have a direct trade with England, while England would have a roundabout way of trading with France. 

Usually, countries trade a mix of their own products and foreign goods. The country that has more of its own products and fewer foreign goods in its trade will always win more. If England paid for French goods with gold and silver instead of other products, the trade would seem unfair because they would be paying with money instead of goods. However, just like before, both countries would still earn some money, but France would earn more than England. 

England would still benefit because the money used to make the goods that bought the gold and silver would come back to England, allowing them to keep producing. So, England’s overall money wouldn’t decrease by sending gold and silver away, just like it wouldn’t decrease by sending out an equal value of goods.
