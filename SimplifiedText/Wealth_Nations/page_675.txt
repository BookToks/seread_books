The Wealth of Nations

Taxes

People's money comes from three main places: rent, profit, and wages. Every tax you pay will eventually come from one of these three sources or sometimes from all of them. I will explain the different types of taxes. First, there are taxes on rent. Second, there are taxes on profit. Third, there are taxes on wages. Lastly, there are taxes that can come from any of these three sources. Each of these four types of taxes will be discussed in this chapter, and some will need more details. You’ll see that many taxes don’t always come from the source they’re supposed to.

Before I talk about specific taxes, I want to share four important rules about taxes in general.

1. Everyone in a country should help pay for the government based on how much money they make. It’s like how people who share a big property have to pay for its upkeep based on how much they own. If people don’t pay their fair share, it creates unfairness in taxes. If a tax only affects one type of income, it’s not fair to the others. In my discussion of different taxes, I won’t focus too much on this kind of unfairness, but I will look at how some taxes affect certain types of income more than others.

2. The amount of tax each person has to pay should be clear and not random. Everyone should know when to pay, how to pay, and how much they owe. If it’s not clear, it makes it harder for people to understand their tax responsibilities.
