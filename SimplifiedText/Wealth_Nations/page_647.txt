The Wealth of Nations

In any society, especially where there are clear social classes, there are usually two different ideas about what is right and wrong. One is strict and serious, while the other is more relaxed and easygoing. The strict way is often admired by regular people, while the relaxed way is usually favored by those who are wealthy or fashionable.

The main difference between these two ideas is how they view fun and excess. In the relaxed system, things like luxury, partying, and even some bad behavior are often overlooked as long as they don’t lead to serious problems like lying or hurting others. People in this system tend to forgive these actions easily. On the other hand, the strict system sees these behaviors as very bad. 

For regular people, being careless can lead to serious consequences. Just a little bit of thoughtlessness can ruin a hardworking person’s life and push them to do terrible things out of despair. Because of this, wise and experienced people from the working class strongly dislike such excesses, knowing how harmful they can be. 

In contrast, wealthy people often think that being able to indulge in excess is a perk of their status. They don’t see their bad behavior as a big deal and often judge it less harshly among their peers. 

Most religions started with regular people, who made up their first followers. These religions usually adopt the strict system of morality, with only a few exceptions.
