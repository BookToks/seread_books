Adam Smith talks about how gum senega, a product from Senegal, was hard to get in Britain because it couldn't be imported easily. So, in 1752, the government allowed it to be brought in from anywhere in Europe, even though this went against normal trade rules. However, they made sure to charge a tax of ten shillings for every hundred weight, and you couldn't get that money back if you exported it later.

When Britain won a war in 1755, they got exclusive trading rights to those areas that France used to control. After the peace was signed, British manufacturers wanted to take advantage of this and make sure they had control over the gum senega trade. So, in 1765, they made a law that only Britain could export gum senega from Africa, and it had to follow strict rules and penalties, just like other goods from British colonies in America and the West Indies. They charged a small tax of sixpence for importing it, but if you wanted to export it, the tax was a huge one of one pound ten shillings.

The manufacturers wanted all the gum to come to Britain so they could set their own prices and prevent it from being exported again without a big cost. But their plan backfired. The high tax made smuggling really tempting, and a lot of gum was secretly exported to other countries in Europe, especially Holland, from both Britain and Africa. Because of this, in 1774, they lowered the export tax to five shillings.

Before 1722, beaver skins were taxed at six shillings and eight pence each, and there were other taxes on them too. But most of those taxes could be refunded when the skins were exported. People thought the tax was too high, so in 1722, they reduced it to two shillings and sixpence.
