The Wealth of Nations

In some countries, the rules about corn are not helping people like they do in Great Britain. The people there don’t have much freedom or safety, and the governments in Spain and Portugal make things worse. Even if their trade rules were better, they would still be poor.

A new law from the current king has changed the corn rules a bit, making them better in some ways, but not in others. 

This law removes high taxes on importing corn when the price of average wheat goes up to 48 shillings per quarter. For other grains, the prices are 32 shillings for rye, 24 shillings for barley, and 16 shillings for oats. Instead of those high taxes, there’s a small tax of only 6 pence on a quarter of wheat and other grains. This means that foreign grain can come in at lower prices than before.

The same law also ends the old payment of 5 shillings for exporting wheat when the price goes up to 44 shillings per quarter, which is lower than the 48 shillings it used to be. For barley, the payment stops at 22 shillings instead of 24, and for oatmeal, it stops at 14 shillings instead of 15. The payment for rye is lowered to 3 shillings and stops at 28 shillings instead of 32. If these payments are not good, it’s better for them to end sooner and be smaller.

The law also allows corn to be imported without tax if it’s going to be exported again, as long as it’s stored in a warehouse locked by both the king and the importer. This rule only applies to 25 main ports in Great Britain, but those are the most important ones. Other ports might not have the right warehouses.

Overall, this law seems to be a better system than the old one. However, it also gives a payment of 2 shillings for exporting oats when the price is below 14 shillings. Before this, there were no payments for exporting oats, peas, or beans.
