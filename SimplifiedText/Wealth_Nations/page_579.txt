The Wealth of Nations

Some people think that having power or wealth doesn’t really help them in the long run. Most people are careful about how they act. People can live together safely even if there’s no government to protect them from bad behavior. But greed and ambition in rich people, along with the poor wanting an easy life and not wanting to work, can lead to problems with stealing or fighting over property. These feelings are strong and affect many people.

When there’s a lot of wealth, there’s also a lot of inequality. For every really rich person, there are at least five hundred poor people. The wealth of a few means that many others are struggling. The rich can make the poor angry, and that anger can lead to attempts to take what the rich have. The only way a rich person can feel safe about their hard-earned property is if there’s a government to protect them. They are always at risk from people they don’t even know, who might want to take what they have. The government is there to stop that from happening. So, having valuable property means we need a government to keep things in order.

When there’s no valuable property, or if what people have is worth just a few days of work, a government isn’t as important. A government means that some people have to follow others. As people get more valuable property, the need for a government grows, and the reasons for some people being in charge also increase with that wealth.

There are four main reasons why some people end up having more power than others. 

The first reason is that some people are just better in certain ways, like being stronger, more attractive, or faster. They might also be smarter or have better morals. Physical strength alone doesn’t give someone power unless they also have mental skills. A strong person can force two weak people to listen to them, but real authority comes from the mind. However, mental qualities are hard to see and can be argued about. No society, whether simple or advanced, has figured out how to decide who is in charge based on these invisible qualities. Instead, they use other, more obvious things.
