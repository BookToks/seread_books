Adam Smith talks about how different rules and restrictions can affect people in society. Sometimes, people who own things or those who don’t produce anything get more benefits than those who actually work to grow food or create products. When this happens, it messes up the balance of how things should be shared. 

Every time this balance is upset, it can lower the overall value of what a society produces over time. This means that the real wealth and income of the society can decline, and how fast this happens depends on how much the balance is disturbed. There are different levels of decline that match how much this balance is broken.

Some doctors think that to stay healthy, you need to stick to a strict diet and exercise plan. If you break the rules even a little, it can lead to health problems. But in reality, people can often stay healthy even with different diets, including some that aren’t considered healthy. It seems like our bodies have a way to fix or prevent the bad effects of a poor diet.

A doctor named Mr. Quesnai had a similar idea about society. He believed that a society could only do well if it followed strict rules of freedom and fairness. He didn’t realize that people naturally try to improve their lives, which helps keep society going even if the rules aren’t perfect. 

Even if some rules slow down progress, they don’t completely stop a nation from becoming wealthier or better off. If a country needed perfect freedom and fairness to succeed, then no country would have ever thrived. Luckily, nature has given societies the ability to keep moving forward despite some unfairness.
