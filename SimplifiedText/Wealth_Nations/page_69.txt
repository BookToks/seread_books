The Wealth of Nations talks about how some everyday things like soap, salt, candles, leather, and alcohol have become more expensive because of taxes. But the poor people don’t buy a lot of these items, so even though prices are going up, they are still able to afford other things that have become cheaper. 

People often say that even the poorest workers want nicer food, clothes, and homes than what they used to be happy with. This shows that it’s not just how much money they make that matters, but also how much better their lives are overall. 

Is this change good or bad for society? It seems pretty clear. Most people in society are workers, and if their lives get better, that can’t be bad for everyone. A society can’t be happy and successful if most of its people are struggling and unhappy. It’s only fair that those who work hard to provide for everyone should also have enough to live well themselves.

Being poor can make it harder to get married, but it doesn’t always stop people from having kids. Sometimes, women who have very little can have many children, while wealthy women might struggle to have any at all. It seems that being rich can make it harder for women to have kids, while being poor doesn’t stop them from having babies.

However, being poor makes it tough to raise children. Even if a mother has many kids, many of them might not survive because of the harsh conditions. In the Highlands of Scotland, it’s common for a mother who has twenty children to only have two survive. Some experienced officers have said they can’t even find enough musicians for their regiments from the children of their soldiers. Although there are many beautiful kids around military bases, very few make it to their teenage years. In some areas, half of the kids don’t live past four years old.
