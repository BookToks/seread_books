The Wealth of Nations

Right now, the land in Great Britain isn’t making more than twenty million a year in rent. If all that land belonged to one owner, they probably wouldn’t even make half of that, and maybe not even a quarter, because it would be poorly managed by their workers. The crown lands in Britain don’t even make a quarter of what private owners could earn from them. If the crown lands were bigger, they might be managed even worse.

The money that most people make from land isn’t based on rent, but on what the land produces. Almost everything produced on the land each year, except what’s saved for seeds, is either used up by people or traded for things they need. Anything that keeps the land from producing as much as it could also lowers the income of regular people even more than it does for landowners. In Great Britain, rent is usually thought to be about a third of the total produce. 

If land that makes ten million a year could make twenty million in a different situation, the owners would lose ten million a year in income. But regular people would lose out on thirty million a year, after setting aside what they need for seeds. This means the population would be smaller by the number of people that thirty million could support, depending on how people live and spend money in different social classes.

Even though no civilized country in Europe mainly gets its public money from state-owned land, there are still large areas of land owned by the crown in many European monarchies. These lands are often forests, and sometimes they’re just empty spaces where you can’t even find a tree after walking for miles. This is a waste because it doesn’t produce anything and doesn’t help the population grow. If the crown lands were sold in any major European monarchy, it would bring in a lot of money. If that money was used to pay off public debts, it could create a much larger income than what those lands currently give to the crown.
