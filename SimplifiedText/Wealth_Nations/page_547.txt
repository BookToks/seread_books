The Wealth of Nations

When a country buys a lot of foreign goods, it can lower the value of what it produces at home. This means that the money it uses to buy those foreign products doesn't go as far as it used to. 

Also, by giving special advantages to its own businesses and workers, the country can make more money from selling things than from farming. This can take money away from farming or stop new money from going into it. So, farming becomes less profitable in two ways: first, because the value of what farmers produce goes down, and second, because other jobs start making more money. This makes people want to invest their time and money in businesses instead of farming.

Even if a country can create its own workers and businesses faster than if it had free trade, it might not be the best way to do it. It could end up creating these jobs too quickly, which might hurt more important jobs. If it pushes for one kind of job too fast, it could hurt another kind that is actually more valuable. This could lead to less productive work because it encourages jobs that donâ€™t really create anything useful.

Mr. Quesnai, a smart thinker, has some ideas about how the total amount of what a country produces is shared among different groups. He created some math formulas to explain this. One of these formulas, called the Economical Table, shows how he thinks this sharing works best when everyone has freedom and the economy is doing well. In this situation, the country produces as much as possible, and each group gets a fair share of what is produced. Other formulas show different ways this sharing could happen.
