When a person has just enough money or resources to last them a few days or weeks, they usually don’t think about making money from it. Instead, they try to use it carefully and work hard to earn more before they run out. For most poor workers, this is how they live.

But when someone has enough money to last for months or even years, they will try to make money from most of it. They will keep just enough for their immediate needs until they start earning more. So, their money is split into two parts. The part they expect to earn money from is called capital. The other part is what they use right away, which can come from what they saved for that purpose, the money they earn over time, or things they bought in the past that they haven’t used up yet, like clothes or furniture. This is what people usually keep for their immediate needs.

There are two main ways to use capital to make money. 

First, it can be used to create, make, or buy goods and then sell them for a profit. The money tied up in goods doesn’t earn anything until they are sold. So, the merchant’s goods don’t make money while they sit in storage, and the cash doesn’t earn anything until it’s used to buy more goods. The money keeps changing forms, and it’s only through this back-and-forth that it can make a profit. This type of capital is called circulating capital.

Second, capital can be used to improve land, buy useful machines, or invest in things that can make money without needing to sell them. This type of capital doesn’t change hands and can keep earning money. This is known as fixed capital.

Different jobs need different amounts of these two types of capital.
