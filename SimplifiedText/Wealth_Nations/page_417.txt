The Wealth of Nations

About thirty to forty years ago, before a certain fishing reward was set up, the price for a barrel of white herrings was around 16 shillings. Then, about ten to fifteen years ago, before the fishing boats were completely messed up, the price went up to between 17 and 20 shillings per barrel. For the last five years, the average price has been about 25 shillings per barrel. This high price might be because there are fewer herrings along the coast of Scotland. 

Also, the barrel that the herrings come in has gotten more expensive since the start of the American war, going from about 3 shillings to about 6 shillings. It’s important to note that the prices I’ve heard about from the past aren’t always the same, and an older, reliable guy told me that more than fifty years ago, a barrel of good herrings usually cost a guinea. I think that might still be seen as the average price. Overall, it seems like the price hasn’t gone down in the local market because of the fishing rewards. 

When fishery businesses get these big rewards but still sell their fish at the same or even higher prices than before, you’d think they’d be making a lot of money. Some people might be making good profits, but I believe most are not. Usually, these rewards encourage people to jump into a business they don’t really know about, and what they lose because of their mistakes often cancels out any money they could make from the government’s help. 

In 1750, the same law that first gave a 30 shilling reward for the white herring fishery also created a big company with a capital of £500,000. People who invested in this company could earn three pounds a year for every hundred pounds they put in, paid out every six months. Besides this big company, it was allowed to set up different fishing groups in various ports, as long as each group raised at least £10,000 to manage their own risks and profits.
