They had been regularly sending bills of exchange to London, and the amount kept growing. When it stopped, it added up to over six hundred thousand pounds. So, in just two years, this bank had lent out more than eight hundred thousand pounds at a five percent interest rate. On the two hundred thousand pounds it printed in bank notes, that five percent could be seen as profit after covering management costs. But on the six hundred thousand pounds it was constantly sending to London, it was paying over eight percent in interest and fees, which meant it was losing more than three percent on most of its business.

The way this bank operated ended up causing problems instead of helping, which is what the people who started it wanted. They thought they were helping exciting projects happening around the country and trying to take business away from other Scottish banks, especially those in Edinburgh, which were slow to approve bills of exchange. This bank did give some temporary help to those project leaders, allowing them to keep going for about two more years than they could have without it. But this just made them go deeper into debt, so when things fell apart, it hit them and their lenders even harder. 

In the end, the bank's actions made the problems worse for the country, which it was trying to help. However, it actually helped the other Scottish banks that it wanted to replace. Those other banks, which had been slow to approve bills of exchange, found a way to get help from this new bank, which welcomed them. Because of this, the other banks managed to escape a tough situation that they couldn't have gotten out of without losing a lot of money and maybe even hurting their reputation.

So, in the long run, what this bank did increased the real problems in the country while helping its competitors get out of trouble.
