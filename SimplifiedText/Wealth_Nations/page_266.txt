Adam Smith said that the value of paper money had dropped below that of gold and silver. Because of this, a law was made to make sure that certain types of paper money were not allowed, just like in Scotland. This law stopped promissory notes worth less than 20 shillings.

In North America, the paper money wasn’t like bank notes that you could get cash for right away. Instead, it was government paper that you couldn’t cash in for several years after it was issued. Even though the colony governments didn’t pay interest on this paper, they said it was legal to use it for full payment. But if you had a note for £100 that you couldn’t cash in for 15 years, it was really only worth about £40 in cash right away. So, forcing someone to accept this paper as full payment for a £100 debt paid in cash was really unfair, almost like a scam by the government.

In Pennsylvania, when they first introduced paper money in 1722, they claimed it was worth the same as gold and silver. They even made rules to punish anyone who charged different prices for goods when paid with paper money compared to gold or silver. This was a pretty harsh rule, but it didn’t really work. A law can say a shilling is worth a guinea, but it can’t force someone to sell their goods for that price if they don’t want to. 

Despite these rules, it turned out that £100 in cash was sometimes seen as worth £130 or even £1100 in paper money in different colonies. This difference happened because of how much paper money was printed and how likely it was that it would be paid back in the future. 

So, the law that said no new paper money could be used as legal payment was actually a fair one, even if people in the colonies complained about it. Pennsylvania was careful about how much paper money it printed, so its paper money never lost value compared to gold.
