The Wealth of Nations

In some places, workers earn different amounts. For example, some earn six, while others might earn nine or ten. In London, the pay can go up to fifteen or eighteen. Learning to be a mason or bricklayer is not very hard, and sometimes even chairmen in London work as bricklayers during the summer. So, the high pay for these workers is not just because of their skill, but also because their jobs can be unpredictable.

A carpenter's job is usually a bit more skilled than a mason's. However, in many places, carpenters earn a little less. Their work is not as dependent on customer requests and is not as affected by bad weather.

When jobs that usually have steady work suddenly donâ€™t, the pay for those workers goes up a lot compared to regular labor. In London, many skilled workers can be hired and let go day by day, just like regular laborers. For example, journeyman tailors earn about two and a half shillings a day, even though regular laborers usually earn about one and a half shillings. In smaller towns, tailors often earn less than regular laborers, but in London, they can go weeks without work, especially in summer.

When a job is tough, dirty, and unpleasant, it can lead to higher pay, even for basic labor. For instance, coal miners in Newcastle often earn about double what regular laborers make, and in some parts of Scotland, they can earn three times as much. Their high pay comes from how hard and dirty their work is. They usually have steady jobs if they want them. Coal-heavers in London have a job that is just as tough and dirty, but their work can be inconsistent because of when coal ships arrive. So, if coal miners earn double or triple the regular pay, it makes sense that coal-heavers might earn four or five times that amount. A few years ago, it was found that they could earn between six to ten shillings a day, with six shillings being about four times what regular laborers earn.
