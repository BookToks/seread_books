Adam Smith

Sometimes, the way politicians act can really hurt things. 

A lot of the main owners of sugar plantations live in Great Britain. They get paid in sugar and rum from their farms. But the sugar and rum that merchants buy from these colonies isn't worth as much as the stuff they sell there. So, they usually have to get paid the difference in gold and silver, and they usually do.

Getting payments from different colonies to Great Britain can be tricky and not always fair. Payments are generally more reliable from the northern colonies than from the tobacco ones. The northern colonies often pay a lot of money, while the tobacco colonies either pay nothing or much less. The trouble with getting payments from sugar colonies depends more on how much unused land they have. If there's a lot of uncultivated land, planters might try to do too much and take on more than they can handle.

For example, Jamaica, which has a lot of unused land, has been less reliable with payments compared to smaller islands like Barbados, Antigua, and St. Christopher’s, which are fully cultivated. These smaller islands have less room for planters to take risks. New islands like Grenada, Tobago, St. Vincent’s, and Dominica have opened up new opportunities, but their payments have also been just as unpredictable as Jamaica's.

So, it’s not that the colonies are poor that causes them to have a shortage of gold and silver. They really want to invest in things that help them grow, so they try to keep as little money sitting around as possible. Because of this, they are okay with using cheaper forms of money instead of gold and silver. This way, they can use the value of that gold and silver for trade, clothing, furniture, and building materials for their farms and homes. In areas where they need gold and silver to do business, they can usually find enough of it when they need it.
