Adam Smith talks about how money works in different places. Sometimes, it seems like one type of money is better than another, but that might not be true in real life. For example, before changes were made to gold coins, it looked like London was at a disadvantage compared to cities like Amsterdam and Venice, which used bank money. But that doesn’t mean London was actually worse off. After the gold coins were changed, London started to look better off, even compared to those cities.

In general, big countries like France or England mostly use their own coins. If their coins get worn out or lose value, they can fix this by changing their coins. However, smaller countries like Genoa or Hamburg often use coins from nearby countries because they trade a lot. So, if they try to fix their coins, it might not help their money situation. If they pay foreign bills with their money, it can be worth less than it should be, making it hard for their traders. 

To help their merchants, small countries have made rules that foreign bills of exchange should be paid through a specific bank instead of using regular money. This bank is backed by the state and must pay in good money that meets the country’s standards. Banks in places like Venice, Genoa, and Amsterdam were created for this reason, even if they later started doing other things.
