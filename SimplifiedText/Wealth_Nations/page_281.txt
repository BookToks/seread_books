The Wealth of Nations

Many smart and honest people have written about these topics. They only wrote what they truly believed.

The amount of goods and work in England was definitely much higher after the Restoration than it was about a hundred years earlier when Elizabeth became queen. Back then, the country was also more developed than it had been a century before, during the fights between the York and Lancaster families. In fact, it was probably in better shape than it was during the Norman conquest and even better than during the messy times of the Saxon kingdoms. Even back then, it was a more advanced place than it was when Julius Caesar invaded, when the people lived like the Native Americans did.

However, during all these times, there were a lot of wasteful spending, unnecessary wars, and a lot of resources used to support people who didn’t help the economy. Sometimes, during civil wars, there was so much waste and destruction that it not only slowed down the growth of wealth but also left the country poorer than it was at the start. 

Even during the best times since the Restoration, many problems and disasters happened that, if they had been predicted, would have made people think the country would end up broke or ruined. Events like the Great Fire and the plague in London, two wars with the Dutch, the chaos of the revolution, the war in Ireland, and four costly wars with France in 1688, 1701, 1742, and 1756, along with two rebellions in 1715 and 1745, caused a lot of trouble. 

During those four wars with France, the country ended up with over £145,000,000 in debt, not counting all the extra costs from those wars. Overall, the total was around £200,000,000. A huge part of the country’s resources has been used to support many people who weren’t productive since the Revolution. If those wars hadn’t taken so much money, most of it would have been used to support people who actually contributed to the economy, helping to grow the country’s wealth each year.
