Adam Smith

Most church leaders had smaller estates than the powerful barons, so they could spend their money on themselves more easily. During the 1300s and 1400s, the barons were very powerful across Europe. But the church's power was fading. They no longer had the same control over the people, and their spiritual authority was weakened too. People didnâ€™t see the clergy as helpers anymore. Instead, they were annoyed by the rich clergy who spent money on luxury instead of helping the poor.

Because of this, kings in different European countries tried to regain their influence over church positions. They wanted to give the power back to local church leaders to choose their bishops and abbots. In England, laws were made in the 1300s to restore this right, especially with something called the statute of provisors. In France, a similar agreement was made in the 1400s. For the elections to be valid, the king had to approve the choice of the bishop or abbot, which meant he could still influence the clergy even if it seemed like the elections were free.

Other countries in Europe had similar rules. However, the pope's power to control church positions was mostly limited in France and England before the Reformation. In the 1500s, a new agreement gave French kings the right to choose leaders for important church positions.

Since this agreement, French clergy have generally shown less respect for the pope's decisions compared to clergy in other Catholic countries. In conflicts between their king and the pope, they often sided with the king.
