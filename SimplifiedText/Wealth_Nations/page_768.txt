Adam Smith

Even though wars are really expensive, people have managed to save money and act wisely, which helped fix the damage done by the government's wasteful spending. After the last big war that Great Britain fought, the country’s farming was doing well, there were lots of workers in factories, and trade was thriving, just like it was before the war. This means that the money supporting all these jobs was just as strong as it had ever been.

Since the peace, farming has improved even more. Rent prices for houses have gone up in every town and village, showing that people are getting wealthier. Also, the total amount of money collected from old taxes, especially from things like customs and excise, has been going up, which clearly shows that people are buying more and, therefore, producing more to keep up with that demand. Great Britain seems to be handling a financial load that no one thought she could manage fifty years ago. However, we shouldn’t jump to conclusions and think she can handle any amount of debt, or assume she could easily manage a little more than what she already has.

Once a country builds up a lot of debt, it’s really rare for them to pay it off completely. If a government ever does manage to clear its debt, it usually happens through bankruptcy, sometimes openly, but often by pretending to pay it off.

One common way to disguise a real bankruptcy is by changing the value of money. For example, if a sixpence suddenly becomes worth a shilling, and twenty sixpences are treated as a pound, someone who borrowed twenty shillings would now only need to pay back with twenty sixpences, which is actually less money. So, a national debt of about one hundred twenty-eight million could be paid off with only about sixty-four million in today’s money. This would only be pretending to pay, and the people owed money would actually lose out on what they were supposed to get. This problem wouldn’t just affect the government’s creditors; it would also hurt regular people who are owed money.
