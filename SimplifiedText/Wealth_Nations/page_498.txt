Adam Smith suggested that trade should only happen with countries south of Cape Finisterre. A rule from an important navigation law made this idea official.

Keeping this trade monopoly has been the main goal of Great Britain's control over its colonies. It’s believed that this exclusive trade is what makes the colonies valuable, even though they haven't really provided money or military support for Great Britain. This monopoly shows how dependent the colonies are, and it’s the only benefit that has come from that dependence. All the money Great Britain has spent to maintain this control has really been to keep this monopoly going.

Before the recent troubles, the cost of keeping peace in the colonies was like paying for twenty army regiments, plus the costs for weapons and supplies needed for them. There was also a big naval force to protect the long coast of North America and the Caribbean from smugglers. This whole peacekeeping cost was paid for by Great Britain and was just a small part of what controlling the colonies has actually cost.

To know the total cost, we also need to add the interest on the money Great Britain has spent on defending the colonies. This includes the expenses from the recent war and a lot of the costs from the war before that. The recent war was mainly about the colonies, and all the money spent on it, no matter where it happened, should be counted as a cost for the colonies. It cost over ninety million pounds, which includes new debts and extra taxes. The Spanish war that started in 1739 was also mainly about the colonies, aiming to stop searches of ships that were illegally trading with Spain. All this spending was really just to support the monopoly. The supposed reason was to help British manufacturing and trade, but the real result was to increase profits for merchants.
