Adam Smith

Back in the day, local leaders had the power to enforce laws in their areas because they could rally all the people against anyone being unfair. No one else had enough power to do this, not even the king. At that time, the king was just the biggest landowner, and the other big landowners respected him mainly to defend against common enemies. If the king tried to make someone pay a small debt in a landowner's area, it would be as tough as trying to stop a civil war because everyone there was armed and ready to back each other up. So, the king had to let those who could manage justice take care of it, and he also had to let the local militia leaders lead the militia.

It's wrong to think that these local powers came from feudal law. The top leaders had the right to make laws, raise armies, and even mint money long before anyone in Europe even heard of feudal law. The Saxon lords in England had just as much power before the Conquest as the Norman lords did afterward. Feudal law only became common law in England after the Conquest. In France, the big landowners had similar powers long before feudal law was introduced there, and this is a well-known fact. These powers came from how property and society were set up back then. 

Even if we don’t look too far back in history, we can find examples that show how these powers always come from certain situations. Just thirty years ago, a guy named Mr. Cameron from Lochiel in Scotland had no legal authority, wasn't a lord, and wasn't even a major landowner. He was just a vassal of the Duke of Argyll, but he still had the highest power over his people. He was known to be fair, even without following all the legal rules. It’s likely that the situation in his area made it necessary for him to take on this power to keep the peace. This guy, who didn’t make more than £500 a year, led 800 men in 1745.
