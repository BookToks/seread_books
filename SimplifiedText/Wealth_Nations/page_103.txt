In any official court, you can deal with these rules. Both of these rules, even though they are backed by a public law, clearly come from the same group mindset that created the bye-law in Sheffield. The silk-weavers in London had just formed their group for about a year when they made a bye-law that said no master could have more than two apprentices at once. It took a special act of parliament to get rid of this bye-law.

For a long time in Europe, seven years was the usual length for apprenticeships in many trades. These groups were once called universities, which is the Latin word for any kind of group. You often see names like the university of smiths or the university of tailors in old town documents. When the universities we know today were first created, the number of years needed to study to become a master of arts seems to have been taken from the seven years of apprenticeship in common trades, which were much older.

To become a master in a common trade, you had to work for seven years under a qualified master. Similarly, to become a master, teacher, or doctor in the liberal arts (which used to mean the same thing), you also needed to study for seven years under a qualified master, so you could have students or apprentices learning from you.

According to the 5th of Elizabeth, known as the Statute of Apprenticeship, no one could practice any trade in England unless they had completed a seven-year apprenticeship. What used to be a bye-law for some groups became a general law for all trades in market towns. Even though the law sounds like it applies to the whole country, it has mostly been limited to market towns. In rural villages, people can practice different trades without needing a seven-year apprenticeship for each one, since they need those trades for convenience and there aren't enough people to specialize in each one.

Also, the law only applies to trades that were already established in England before the 5th of Elizabeth and doesn't cover any new trades that came after that. This limitation has led to various distinctions.
