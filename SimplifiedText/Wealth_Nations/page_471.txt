The Wealth of Nations

The main advisors have often looked out for their own interests more than those of the colonies or the mother country. Because they had the exclusive right to sell goods to the colonies and buy their extra products, the needs of the colonies were often ignored for the benefit of these merchants. 

When it came to re-exporting most European and East India goods to the colonies, the interests of the mother country were also overlooked. Merchants wanted to pay as little as possible for the foreign goods they sent to the colonies. This way, they could either sell the same amount of goods for more profit or sell more goods for the same profit, making money either way. The colonies wanted to get these goods as cheaply and abundantly as possible, but this sometimes hurt the mother country. 

The mother country could lose money because they had to give back a lot of the taxes paid on these goods. They could also struggle in their own markets if foreign goods were sold for less in the colonies. For example, it’s said that the growth of Britain's linen industry was slowed down because of the tax breaks given on German linen sent to American colonies.

Even though Britain’s trade policies for its colonies were influenced by the same business mindset as other countries, they were generally less harsh and unfair. 

Aside from foreign trade, the English colonists had full freedom to run their own affairs. Their rights were equal to those of people back home and were protected by a group of representatives who had the exclusive right to impose taxes for the colony's government. This assembly had power over the governor and other officials, so as long as a colonist followed the law, they didn’t have to worry about being treated unfairly by the governor or any other local leaders. The colony assemblies were similar to the House of Commons in England.
