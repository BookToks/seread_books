The Wealth of Nations

The way people get rich has never lasted long enough for any big country to gather enough money for three main things: farming, making stuff, and trading with other countries. The only exceptions might be China, ancient Egypt, and old India. These places were known for being really good at farming and making things, but they didn’t do much trading with other countries. The Egyptians were scared of the sea, and the Indians had similar fears. The Chinese also weren’t great at trading with other countries. Most of what they produced was sold to foreigners who traded it for things like gold and silver.

In any country, the money invested can create more or less work and add more or less value to what the land and people produce, depending on how it’s used in farming, making things, or trading. The impact can vary a lot based on what kind of trading is happening.

There are three main types of wholesale trade: home trade, foreign trade for consumption, and carrying trade. Home trade is when you buy stuff in one part of the country and sell it in another. This includes both inland trade and trade along the coast. Foreign trade for consumption is when you buy goods from other countries to use at home. The carrying trade is when you handle trade between different countries or move surplus goods from one place to another.

When money is used to buy goods in one part of the country to sell in another, it usually replaces two different amounts of money that were used in farming or making things. This helps those industries keep going. When a merchant sends out goods worth a certain amount, they usually get back goods worth at least the same amount. If both sets of goods come from local industries, it replaces the two amounts of money used to support jobs, allowing those jobs to keep going.
