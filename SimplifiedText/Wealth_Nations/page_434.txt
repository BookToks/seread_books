Adam Smith

The laws in Great Britain made it hard to trade goods from other countries because of high taxes on imported corn. When there was a shortage of corn, the government would temporarily lift these taxes, but they still didn’t allow exporting. Because of these laws, trading was basically banned.

The laws that were supposed to help the economy don’t deserve all the praise they get. The growth and success of Great Britain can be explained by other reasons. The main reason is that people in Britain feel safe knowing they can keep what they earn from their work. This feeling of security helped the country grow, especially after the Revolution, which happened around the same time the bounty was introduced. When people are free to improve their lives, they can make the country rich and successful, even when there are many silly laws that get in the way. These laws often limit freedom or make people feel less secure. In Britain, people can work without fear, and while it’s not completely free, it’s still better than in most other European countries.

Even though Great Britain became more successful after the laws about the bounty were put in place, we shouldn’t blame those laws for the success. The country’s success also happened after it took on a national debt, but that debt isn’t the reason for the growth either.

The laws about the bounty in Britain are similar to what Spain and Portugal did, which lowered the value of precious metals in their countries. However, Great Britain is one of the richest countries in Europe, while Spain and Portugal are among the poorest. This difference can be explained by a couple of reasons. First, Spain has heavy taxes, and Portugal doesn’t allow exporting gold and silver. These strict rules in two very poor countries, which import a lot of money each year, make the situation worse and lower the value of their money even more.
