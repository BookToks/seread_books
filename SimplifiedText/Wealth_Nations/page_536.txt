If someone gets caught trying to convince a skilled worker to leave the country, they can be fined up to one hundred pounds and spend three months in jail until they pay the fine. If they do it again, the fine can be whatever the court decides, and they could go to jail for a year until they pay. 

According to a law from King George II, the penalty for the first offense goes up to five hundred pounds for each worker involved and a year in jail. For a second offense, it’s a thousand pounds and two years in jail. 

If someone is found trying to get a skilled worker to leave or if a worker agrees to go abroad, the court can make that worker promise not to leave the country. If they don’t, they can be sent to jail until they make that promise. 

If a skilled worker does leave and starts working or teaching their trade in another country, they have six months to come back after being warned by a government official. If they don’t return, they can’t inherit anything, be an executor or administrator, or own land in their home country. They also lose all their property to the king and are treated like a foreigner, losing the king’s protection. 

These rules really go against the freedom we like to brag about, but they are clearly made to protect the interests of our merchants and manufacturers. The main goal of these rules is to help our own businesses grow, not by improving them but by making it harder for other countries to compete. Our manufacturers want to keep all the skills and knowledge to themselves. They limit how many apprentices can work in certain trades and make apprenticeships last a long time, trying to keep the knowledge within a small group. However, they don’t want even that small group to go abroad and teach others. 

In the end, the main reason for producing goods is for people to use them.
