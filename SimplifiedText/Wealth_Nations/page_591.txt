The Wealth of Nations

Public works, like roads and bridges, help make goods cheaper for people, even with tolls. The tolls don't raise prices much because the cost of transporting goods is lower. So, the person who pays the toll actually benefits more than they lose. They only give up a small part of their gain to get the rest. This seems like a fair way to collect taxes.

When tolls on fancy carriages, like coaches, are higher than on necessary vehicles, like carts, it makes rich people help out the poor. This is because it makes it cheaper to transport heavy goods everywhere.

Roads, bridges, and canals are built where they are needed for trade, and their cost should match what that trade can afford. You can't build a fancy road in a place with no trade or just to please a rich person. A big bridge shouldn't be built where no one crosses it, or just to make a palace look nicer. These things sometimes happen when money comes from sources other than what the projects can actually support.

In some parts of Europe, private people own the tolls on canals, which makes them want to keep the canals in good shape. If they don't, the canal won't work, and they won't make any money. If the tolls were managed by people who didn't care about them, they might not take care of the canals as well. For example, the canal of Languedoc cost a lot of money to build, and once it was done, the best way to keep it repaired was to give a gift.
