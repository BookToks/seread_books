In tough times, when the government really needs money, people who rent land often complain that they can’t pay their usual rent without stricter laws. When the government is desperate for cash, they make the tax laws tougher. Countries where most taxes come from land rentals tend to have harsher laws, while places where the government collects taxes directly have milder ones. Even a bad ruler cares more about his people than the land renters do. He knows that his family's success depends on the well-being of his people, so he won’t ruin them for his own short-term gain. But for the land renters, their success can sometimes come from hurting the people.

Sometimes, taxes are collected in a way that gives the tax collector a monopoly on what they tax. In France, for example, taxes on tobacco and salt are collected this way. This means the tax collector makes a lot of money from both the tax and the monopoly. Tobacco is a luxury, so people can choose whether to buy it or not. But salt is necessary, so everyone has to buy a certain amount from the tax collector. If they don’t, they might end up buying from someone breaking the law. Because of this, the taxes on both tobacco and salt are really high. Many people are tempted to smuggle these items, but the strict laws and watchful tax collectors make it risky. Smuggling salt and tobacco gets a lot of people in serious trouble, with some even ending up in prison or worse.

These taxes bring in a lot of money for the government. For example, in 1767, the tax on tobacco was set to bring in over 22 million livres a year, and the tax on salt was set for over 36 million livres. These tax agreements were supposed to start in 1768 and last for six years. Some people who don’t care about the suffering of others might think this way of collecting taxes is okay. Similar taxes and monopolies on salt and tobacco have been set up in many other countries too.
