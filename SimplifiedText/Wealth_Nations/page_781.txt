The Wealth of Nations

People often think they can’t find money because they are poor, but it’s usually because they are trying too hard to get rich quickly. Their payments are not steady because they want to make a lot of money too fast. Even if the extra money from the colonies went to Great Britain in gold and silver, the colonies still have enough to buy what they need. 

However, they would have to trade some of their extra goods for things that don’t help them grow, which could make their business more expensive. This could slow down their excitement and energy to improve their land. But they might not even need to send any money in gold or silver. They could send bills to certain merchants in Great Britain, who would pay the American revenue in cash after getting the value in goods. This way, they might not have to send any gold or silver from America at all.

It’s fair for both Ireland and America to help pay off Great Britain’s public debt. This debt was created to support the government that came from the Revolution, which gives the Protestants in Ireland their rights and freedoms. Many American colonies also owe their current rights to this government, which has helped them keep their freedom, property, and religion safe. This debt was not just for Great Britain but for all parts of the empire, especially during the wars that protected America.

If Ireland joins with Great Britain, it would not only get better trade but also other important benefits that would be worth any extra taxes. By uniting with England, the average people in Scotland were freed from the control of the rich and powerful.
