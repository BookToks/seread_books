The Wealth of Nations

Most of the land was used for growing corn, but a lot of land was not being used or improved. This shows that the number of people and the amount of resources in the country didn't match up with how much land there was, which is usually the case in more developed countries. Back then, society was still pretty new.

When we look at how much things cost, like goods in general or corn specifically, we can only tell if the gold and silver mines were good or not. We can't really say if the country was rich or poor just from that. However, if we compare the prices of different goods, we can get a good idea of whether the country was doing well or not, and if most of the land was being used or not.

If the price of goods goes up because silver has lost value, then all goods would increase in price by about the same amount. But the price of food, especially corn, doesn't always go up the same way. In this century, the price of corn has actually gone up less than some other foods, even though some people think it's because of silver losing value. So, there must be other reasons for the price increases in those other foods.

As for corn itself, over the first sixty-four years of this century, its price has been a bit lower than it was during the last sixty-four years of the previous century. This has been confirmed by market reports from Windsor and various counties in Scotland, as well as from different markets in France. The evidence collected is more complete than we would expect for something that's usually hard to figure out.
