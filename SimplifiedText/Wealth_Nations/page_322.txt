Adam Smith

With this grant, the town got some important rights. They could marry off their daughters, pass their stuff on to their kids, and decide who gets their things when they die. These rights were usually given to the townspeople. I’m not sure if these rights were often given to individual townspeople before, but it seems possible, even if I can't prove it. Either way, by taking away the harsh rules of being a serf or a slave, they became truly free, like we think of freedom today.

But that’s not all. They also became a group or corporation, which meant they could have their own leaders and town council. They could make their own rules, build walls for protection, and organize their people to keep watch and defend those walls from attacks, day and night. In England, they usually didn't have to go to the big courts for issues among themselves; their own leaders could handle those problems, except for serious cases involving the crown. In other places, they often got even more power.

It might have been necessary for towns that managed their own money to have some way to make sure their citizens paid up. Back then, it would have been really tough to rely on other courts for that kind of justice. It’s surprising that rulers across Europe would give up a steady income from taxes that could grow naturally over time without any extra effort. They basically created independent towns right in the middle of their own lands.

To understand this, remember that back then, no ruler in Europe could fully protect the weaker people from the powerful lords. Those who couldn’t rely on the law for help and weren’t strong enough to defend themselves had to find other ways to survive.
