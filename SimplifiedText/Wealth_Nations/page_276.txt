Adam Smith talks about how money can be used for different things, like buying clothes and housing. Even though the same amount of money is spent, the people using it can be different.

When a careful person saves money, they can help support more workers in the future. It’s like starting a fund that helps people work for a long time. This fund doesn’t always have strict rules, but it’s protected by a strong idea: everyone wants to make sure it helps people who work. If someone uses this money for things that don’t help people work, they lose out.

A careless spender messes this up. By spending more than they earn, they take away from their savings. It’s like using money meant for good causes for things that don’t matter. When they spend money on people who aren’t working, they reduce the money available for those who do work, which affects the overall wealth of the country.

If some people waste money, it can hurt everyone else. Even if they only buy things made in their own country, it still takes away from what could have been used to support workers. Every year, there’s less food and clothing available for those who work. So, even if the same amount of money stays in the country, it doesn’t help as much as it could have if it had been spent wisely. If that money had been used to support workers, it would have created even more value for the country.
