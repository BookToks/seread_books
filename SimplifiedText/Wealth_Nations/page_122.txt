In the past, people often tried to control how much money merchants and sellers could make by setting prices for food and other goods. The price of bread is one of the few things left from that time. 

If there’s a group that controls a certain market, it might make sense to set prices for basic needs like food. But if there isn’t such a group, competition will do a better job of setting prices than any rules. 

In Scotland, a law about bread prices from a long time ago couldn’t be followed because there was a missing part in the law. This issue wasn’t fixed until later. Not having this price control didn’t cause any major problems, and where it has been set up, it hasn’t really helped much either. 

In many Scottish towns, there are groups of bakers who say they have special rights, but these aren’t always enforced strictly. The balance between different pay rates for jobs doesn’t seem to change much based on whether society is rich or poor, or whether it’s growing or struggling. Changes in society can affect pay rates, but in the end, they usually balance out across different jobs. So, the overall relationship between these rates stays pretty much the same and doesn’t change quickly, even with big changes in society.
