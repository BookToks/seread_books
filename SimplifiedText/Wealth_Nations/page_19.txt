The Wealth of Nations

People work hard in jobs that fit their skills, which helps everyone get better at what they do. 

The differences in talent between people aren’t as big as we think. The unique skills that seem to separate people in different jobs often come from what they do for work rather than from nature. For example, a philosopher and a street porter might seem very different, but they likely started out similar when they were young. At first, no one could see much difference between them. But as they grew up and started doing very different jobs, their skills became more noticeable. Over time, the philosopher might think they have nothing in common with the street porter. 

If people didn’t trade or exchange things, everyone would have to find everything they needed on their own. They would all have the same tasks and jobs, so there wouldn’t be much difference in skills. 

This ability to trade and exchange is what makes the differences in skills useful. In nature, some animals of the same species show more differences in abilities than people do. For example, a philosopher isn’t as different from a street porter as a mastiff is from a greyhound or a spaniel. However, these different types of dogs don’t help each other out. A mastiff’s strength doesn’t help a greyhound’s speed or a spaniel’s cleverness. Because they can’t trade or share their skills, they can’t work together to make life easier for their species. Each animal has to take care of itself and doesn’t benefit from the different talents of others. 

But with people, the most different skills can actually help everyone.
