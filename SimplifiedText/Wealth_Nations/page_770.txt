Adam Smith

People who owed money often had to vote for the candidate their creditor wanted, even if they didn’t want to. Even though there were laws against bribery, candidates would give money to help poorer citizens. This money was important for those who didn’t have much. To escape from their debts, poorer citizens often demanded that all debts be canceled or that new laws be made. These new laws would let them pay back only a part of what they owed.

One law made all coins worth much less, which meant they could pay off their debts with just a small amount of money. This was like getting a really good deal. To keep the people happy, rich folks sometimes agreed to cancel debts or make new laws. They did this partly to help the government stay strong, which they were in charge of. This kind of change could turn a huge debt of £128 million into just £21 million.

During the second Punic War, the value of coins kept dropping. For example, a coin that used to be worth two ounces of copper was reduced to just half an ounce. If you put all these changes together, a debt of £128 million could be cut down to about £5 million. Even a big debt like Great Britain's could be paid off this way.

Because of these methods, the value of money in many countries has slowly gone down over time. The same amount of money now contains less silver than before. Sometimes countries have even messed with the quality of their coins by adding cheaper metals to them. For instance, if a pound of silver coins had a lot of cheap metal mixed in, it would be worth much less than a pound of real silver. This would make the amount of silver in a smaller amount of money seem like it was worth more, which is a trick that affects how people see the value of money.
