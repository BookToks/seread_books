Adam Smith talks about the tolls that are paid to Riquet, the engineer who designed and built a project. These tolls now provide a lot of money for Riquet's family, so they want to keep the project in good shape. If the tolls were managed by people who didn’t care about the project, they might waste the money on fancy things instead of fixing what really needs to be fixed.

When it comes to roads, it’s not safe to let private people own the tolls. Even if a road is ignored, it can still be used, but a canal can’t be used if it’s not taken care of. The people who own the tolls for a road might not bother to fix it, but they could still charge almost the same amount of tolls. That’s why it’s better for the tolls to be managed by a group of commissioners or trustees.

In Great Britain, people have complained about how these trustees manage the tolls. At many toll booths, it’s said that they collect more than double what is needed to keep the roads in good shape, and often the work is done poorly or not at all. The system of using tolls to fix roads isn’t very old, so it’s not surprising that it hasn’t been perfected yet. If the wrong people are chosen as trustees and there aren’t good checks to control how they spend the money, it makes sense that there are problems. Over time, the government can fix these issues.

The money collected at toll booths in Great Britain is thought to be way more than what is needed for road repairs. Some government officials believe that if they managed the tolls themselves, they could save a lot of money. They could hire soldiers, who would work for a little extra pay, to keep the roads in good shape for less money than the trustees do, who only hire workers that rely on their wages to live. This could lead to a lot of savings, maybe even half a million.
