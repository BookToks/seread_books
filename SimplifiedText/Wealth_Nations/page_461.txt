The Wealth of Nations

In Pennsylvania, there’s no rule that gives the oldest child all the land. Instead, land is shared equally among all the kids in the family. In three New England states, the oldest child gets a little more, but not much. Even if one person ends up with a lot of land, it usually gets divided up again after a generation or two. 

In other English colonies, the oldest child does get everything, just like in England. But in all the English colonies, land ownership is set up so that it’s easy to sell or give away land. People who own a lot of land often sell most of it off quickly, keeping only a small part for themselves. 

In Spanish and Portuguese colonies, there’s a rule that says big estates with titles go to just one person. This means those estates can’t be sold or divided. French colonies have different rules that are better for younger kids when it comes to inheritance. However, if part of a noble estate is sold, it can be bought back for a while by the original owner’s family. Most of the big estates in France are held by these noble rules, which make it hard to sell them. 

In new colonies, large pieces of land that aren’t being used are usually divided up faster through selling than through inheritance. The availability and low prices of good land are what help new colonies grow quickly. When one person takes too much land, it can ruin that availability and drive up prices. Also, when land isn’t improved or farmed, it stops society from getting the benefits that come from working the land. 

The work done on the land not only pays for itself but also helps cover the rent for the land. Because people in the English colonies focus more on improving and farming their land, they are likely to produce more and better goods than people in the other colonies, where land is often hoarded and not used as much. 

So, the work of English colonists is expected to create more valuable products, and as a result of that...
