The Wealth of Nations

Imagine a clerk working far away, like 10,000 miles, who suddenly has to stop doing their own business just because their boss said so. They have to give up their dreams of getting rich, even though they have the chance to make money. Instead, they have to settle for the average salary their boss pays, which usually can’t get any higher because it’s already as much as the company can afford.

When the company tells its workers they can’t trade on their own, it mostly helps the higher-ups. They can use their power to bully the lower-ranking workers who they don’t like. The workers naturally want to keep the same trading advantages for themselves that the company has. If they could, they would make sure no one else could sell the same things they want to sell, which might be the easiest way to do it. But if they’re told they can’t do that, they’ll still try to create a secret monopoly, which can actually hurt the country more.

The private trade of these workers can cover a lot more products than what the company sells. The company’s trade is mostly just with Europe and doesn’t include everything else the country trades. But the workers can trade in many different areas, both inside the country and with other countries. The company’s monopoly can hold back the growth of what could be exported to Europe if trade were free. Meanwhile, the workers’ monopoly can limit the growth of everything they choose to sell, whether it’s for people to use at home or for export. This can hurt farming and lower the population of the country. It can even reduce the amount of food and other basic needs whenever the workers decide to sell them, to just what they think they can buy and sell for a profit.
