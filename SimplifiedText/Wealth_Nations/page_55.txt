The Wealth of Nations

Sometimes, the amount of stuff sold in stores isn’t enough to meet what people want to buy. Because of this, sellers can charge more than what it costs to grow the products, pay the workers, and make a profit. This can happen for a long time, and the extra money that goes to landowners is often more than what it should be. 

For example, some special vineyards in France can charge a lot more for their grapes because they are in a great location, even though other nearby farms are just as good. However, the pay for workers and the profits from selling these products usually stay about the same as other jobs in the area.

These higher prices happen because of natural reasons that can keep the supply from ever meeting the demand, and this can go on forever.

When one person or a company has a monopoly, it’s like they have a secret that helps them make more money. They keep the market from being fully stocked, so they can sell their products for much more than what they should cost. This means they can make a lot more money than usual.

Monopoly prices are always the highest they can get. On the other hand, prices in a free market are usually the lowest that can be accepted for a long time. The monopoly price is what they can get from buyers, while the natural price is what sellers can afford to take and still keep their business running.

Certain laws and rules that limit how many people can work in specific jobs also keep prices higher than they should be. These rules act like smaller monopolies and can keep prices up for a long time, making both worker pay and profits higher than normal.
