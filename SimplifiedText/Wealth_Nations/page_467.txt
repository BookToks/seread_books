The Wealth of Nations

America produces some unique stuff that you can't find in the mother country, like molasses, coffee, cocoa, tobacco, ginger, whale fins, raw silk, cotton, wool, beaver fur, indigo, and other dyeing woods. 

There are also things that can be made in the mother country but not enough to meet the demand, so they rely on imports. This includes things like masts, tar, pitch, turpentine, iron, copper ore, and animal hides. Even if America imports a lot of the unique products, it wonâ€™t hurt what the mother country produces. 

By keeping these products for sale only in the home market, merchants could buy them cheaper in the colonies and sell them for a better profit back home. This would also help Britain become a central hub for trade with other countries. The goal was to make sure that the imported goods from other countries were more expensive than what was produced at home, so people would buy local products instead.

The rules that stopped the colonies from selling certain goods like masts and tar to anyone but Great Britain made timber cheaper in the colonies. This actually made it harder for them to clear their land for farming, which was a big problem for them. 

In 1703, a company in Sweden tried to raise prices by only allowing their pitch and tar to be sold on their ships and at their prices. To fight back and become less dependent on Sweden and other northern countries, Great Britain offered rewards for importing naval supplies from America. This made timber prices in America go up even more than the restrictions did.
