America played a really important role in trade. By opening up a huge market for European goods, it allowed for new jobs and better products that couldn’t have happened before because there wasn’t enough demand. This made work more productive and increased wealth in Europe. Many European products were new to America, and vice versa. This led to new trade opportunities that benefited both America and Europe. Unfortunately, the unfair actions of Europeans made this situation harmful for some countries.

Around the same time, discovering a route to the East Indies through the Cape of Good Hope opened up even more trade options than America, even though it was farther away. In America, there were only two groups that were somewhat advanced compared to the native people, and they were wiped out quickly after being found. Most of the people there were still living in basic ways. In contrast, countries like China, India, and Japan were much richer and more developed than Mexico or Peru, even if we don’t fully believe the exaggerated stories told by Spanish writers about those places. Rich and developed nations can trade more valuable goods with each other than with less advanced societies.

However, Europe has gained less from trading with the East Indies than with America. For about a hundred years, the Portuguese controlled the East India trade, which meant other European countries could only trade through them. When the Dutch started to take over that trade, they created a special company to control it. Other countries like England, France, Sweden, and Denmark did the same thing, so no major European nation has ever had free trade with the East Indies. This is why trading with the East Indies hasn’t been as beneficial as trading with America, where trade is open to all European nations and their colonies. The special rights of those East India companies and their wealth have limited the benefits for everyone else.
