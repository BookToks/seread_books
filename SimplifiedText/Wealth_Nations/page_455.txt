The Wealth of Nations

A landowner wants to get as much produce as possible from his land, but usually, he can only make a small part of what it could really produce. He tries to hire workers from everywhere and pays them good wages. However, because the land is cheap and there are good wages, these workers often leave to buy their own land and hire other workers, who then do the same thing. 

Good pay encourages people to get married. Their kids are well-fed and taken care of when they are young. When these kids grow up, their work is worth more than what it cost to raise them. As adults, they can buy land and set up their own lives just like their parents did.

In other countries, the rich take most of the money, and the powerful people treat the less powerful badly. But in new colonies, the rich have to treat the poor better, especially if they are not slaves. There are lots of fertile lands available for very little money. The landowner expects to make a lot of money by improving the land, but he needs workers to help clear and farm it. Since there’s usually a lot of land and not many people in new colonies, it can be hard to find workers. So, he doesn’t argue about pay and is willing to hire workers at any price. 

High wages attract more people. Cheap and plentiful land encourages improvements and allows landowners to pay those high wages. Most of the cost of the land comes from these wages. Even though the wages seem high for workers, they are low compared to the value of the land. When population and improvements grow, real wealth and greatness grow too.

Many ancient Greek colonies became wealthy and powerful very quickly. In just a century or two, some of them became as good as or even better than their original cities. Places like Syracuse and Agrigentum in Sicily, Tarentum and Locri in Italy, and Ephesus and Miletus in Asia Minor were at least as great as any city in ancient Greece.
