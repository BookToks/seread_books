The Wealth of Nations

Some foods are not as good and cost more to make, so they are more expensive. Because of this, they can't compete with fresh meat, but they might compete with the salted food in the country. These lower-quality foods could be used to feed ships going on long trips, but they won't be a big part of what people eat. The small amount of salted food brought in from Ireland since it became free shows that our farmers don’t need to worry about it. The price of meat hasn’t really changed because of it.

Even when foreign corn is allowed in for free, it doesn't really hurt British farmers much. Corn takes up more space than meat. A pound of wheat at one penny costs the same as a pound of meat at four pennies. The small amount of foreign corn brought in, even during tough times, should reassure farmers that they have nothing to fear from allowing more imports. On average, only about 23,728 quarters of grain come in each year, which is just a tiny fraction of what people use.

When there’s a reward for exporting corn, more gets sent out in good years, which means more will need to be brought in during bad years. This means that the good harvest of one year doesn’t make up for the bad harvest of another. If there wasn’t a reward, less corn would be sent out, and probably less would be brought in too. The people who move corn between Britain and other countries would have less work and might struggle, but farmers wouldn’t be affected much. It seems that the corn merchants are the ones most worried about keeping the reward going, not the farmers.

Farmers and country gentlemen are, thankfully, the least greedy people. Someone running a big factory might get worried if another one opens nearby, but farmers usually want to help each other out and improve their land instead of blocking others from doing the same.
