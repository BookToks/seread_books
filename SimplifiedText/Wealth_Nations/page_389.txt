The Wealth of Nations

The bank keeps a record of every guilder it gives out as credit, and it also holds the same amount in money or gold. It has to keep all the money or gold for which it has receipts, which means it can be asked to return it at any time. This money is constantly moving in and out of the bank, so there's no doubt about that. 

However, it’s less clear what happens with the money for which the receipts have expired. In normal times, the bank doesn’t have to return this money, and it might stay with the bank forever, as long as the United Provinces exist. In Amsterdam, people strongly believe that for every guilder used as bank money, there’s a real guilder in gold or silver in the bank's vaults. The city ensures that this is true.

The bank is managed by four elected leaders called burgomasters, who change every year. Each new group checks the bank’s treasure, compares it to the records, swears an oath about it, and then hands it over to the next group with a serious ceremony. In this careful country, people take their oaths seriously. This system seems to be a good way to prevent any dishonest actions.

Even during political changes in Amsterdam, no one has ever accused the previous leaders of being untrustworthy with the bank. Such an accusation would seriously damage the reputation of the accused group, and if it could be proven, it would have been brought up. In 1672, when the French king was nearby, the Amsterdam bank paid out money so quickly that it showed how reliable it was. Some coins that were taken out even looked burned from a fire that happened in the town hall shortly after the bank was set up, meaning those coins had been there for a long time.

People have long wondered how much treasure the bank actually has. We can only guess. It’s thought that around 2000 people have accounts with the bank, and if each of them has about £1500 (which is a lot), the total amount of bank money would be around £3,000,000 or about 33,000,000 guilders. That’s a huge amount and enough to support a lot of transactions, but it’s much less than some people imagine.
