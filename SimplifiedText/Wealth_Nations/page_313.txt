The Wealth of Nations

A wealthy person focused more on controlling their land and power than on making it better. They didn’t have time to improve their land. Even when they had the chance, they often didn’t want to do it and usually didn’t know how. If their spending was equal to or more than their income, which happened a lot, they didn’t have any money left to invest in their land. If they were smart with money, they usually found it better to spend their savings on new things instead of fixing up what they already owned.

To make land better and earn money from it, just like any business, you need to pay attention to small savings and gains. But someone who is born rich, even if they are careful with money, usually struggles with this. They tend to care more about fancy things that look good rather than making money, since they don’t need to worry about it as much. They focus on how nice their clothes, car, house, and furniture look because they’ve always been taught to care about those things. 

When they think about improving their land, they might spend a lot of money to make a few hundred acres around their house look nice, but it costs way more than the land is worth after all those changes. If they tried to improve all their land like that, they would run out of money before finishing even a small part. 

In both parts of the UK, there are still big estates that have been owned by the same family since the old days when there was chaos. If you look at how those estates are doing compared to smaller properties nearby, it’s clear that having such large amounts of land makes it harder to improve things.

If big landowners didn’t improve their land much, the people who rented from them did even less. In the past in Europe, land renters were mostly tenants who could be kicked out at any time. They were like slaves, but their situation was not as harsh as what was seen in ancient Greece and Rome or in the West Indies. They were more tied to the land than to their owners. They could be sold with the land but not separately. They could marry, but only if their owner agreed, and the owner couldn’t break up the marriage by selling them to different people. If an owner hurt or killed them, they would face some punishment, though usually not a serious one. However, they couldn’t own property themselves. Anything they gained would belong to their master.
