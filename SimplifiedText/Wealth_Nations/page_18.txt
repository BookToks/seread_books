Adam Smith talks about how people help each other out because it benefits them. When someone offers a deal, they’re saying, “If you give me what I want, I’ll give you what you want.” This is how we get most of the things we need from each other. For example, we don’t get our meals from the kindness of the butcher, brewer, or baker; we get them because they want to make money. We focus on what they gain, not on our own needs.

Only someone who is really desperate relies mostly on the kindness of others. Even a beggar doesn’t depend on it completely. While kind people help him out, he still needs to get things like food and clothes through trade or buying. If someone gives him money, he uses it to buy food. If he gets old clothes, he might trade them for something better or for food or a place to stay.

The way we trade and buy things helps us get what we need from each other. This same idea of trading is what leads to people specializing in different jobs. For example, in a group of hunters, one person might be really good at making bows and arrows. He trades them for meat or animals with his friends and realizes he can get more this way than if he hunted himself. So, he decides to focus on making bows and arrows and becomes an expert at it.

Another person might be great at building shelters. He helps his neighbors, who then give him meat or animals in return. Eventually, he finds it better to just build shelters all the time. Similarly, someone else might become a blacksmith or a tanner, making clothes from animal skins. This way, they can trade what they make for what they need, leading to a system where everyone specializes in what they do best.
