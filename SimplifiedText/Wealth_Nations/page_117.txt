The Wealth of Nations

This situation makes it hard for regular workers to find jobs. It’s important to understand how this problem started, how it has changed over time, and what it looks like now in England.

When the monasteries were destroyed, poor people lost the help they used to get from these religious places. After trying other ways to help them, a law was made that said every neighborhood had to take care of its own poor people. They had to pick people called overseers to collect money from everyone in the neighborhood to help those in need.

This law made it clear that every neighborhood had to look after its own poor. But it was important to decide who counted as poor. This question was figured out later when another law was made. It said that if someone lived in a neighborhood for forty days without being disturbed, they could be considered a resident. However, during those forty days, if the church leaders or overseers complained, two local judges could send that person back to where they lived before unless they paid enough rent or could prove they wouldn’t be a burden.

Some people tried to cheat this system. Sometimes, the neighborhood leaders would pay their poor people to sneak into another neighborhood and stay hidden for forty days to claim they lived there. To fix this, another law was made saying that the forty days only counted after the person told the church leaders in writing where they lived and how many people were in their family.

But it seems that neighborhood leaders weren’t always honest. Sometimes they ignored these rules and let people sneak in without taking action. Since everyone in a neighborhood wanted to avoid having extra people who could be a burden, another law was made saying that the forty days only counted after the person announced their arrival in writing during church on Sunday after the service.

In the end, Doctor Burn pointed out that actually getting this kind of residency by living there for forty days after announcing it is really rare. The purpose of these laws wasn’t just to make things easier for the poor.
