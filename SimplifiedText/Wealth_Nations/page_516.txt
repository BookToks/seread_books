Adam Smith talks about how the ports of China and Japan, along with places like Tonquin, Malacca, Cochin-China, and the island of Celebes, often have ships coming in and out. This good location has helped the colonies there overcome challenges that a strict trading company might create. It has also helped Batavia deal with its really unhealthy climate.

The English and Dutch trading companies haven't set up many big colonies, except for the two mentioned earlier, but they've taken over a lot of land in the East Indies. However, the way they treat the people they govern shows how controlling these companies can be. In the spice islands, the Dutch are known to burn any extra spices that grow, only keeping what they think they can sell for a good profit in Europe. In places where they don't have settlements, they pay people to collect young flowers and leaves from clove and nutmeg trees, which are native to those islands. Unfortunately, this harsh approach has nearly wiped out those trees. Even in their own settlements, they have reduced the number of these trees a lot. They worry that if there’s too much spice, the locals might sell it to other countries, so they try to keep the supply low to maintain their control over the market.

Through various harsh methods, they have made the population in some of the Moluccas islands very small, just enough to provide food for their small military bases and the ships that come by for spices. Even when the Portuguese were in charge, those islands were still reasonably populated. The English company hasn’t had enough time to create such a damaging system in Bengal yet, but their way of governing is heading in the same direction. 

It’s not unusual for the main guy in charge, like the first clerk at a trading post, to tell a farmer to stop growing poppies and plant rice instead. They say it’s to avoid food shortages, but really, it’s so the chief can sell a lot of opium he has at a better price. Sometimes, the opposite happens, and they tell farmers to stop growing rice to plant more poppies when they think they can make a lot of money from opium.
