Adam Smith talks about how taxes can be unfair. When the government needs money, it often takes it from poor people instead of rich ones. This means that those who can least afford it end up paying the most.

If the government stops fixing the main roads, it will be even harder to make sure that the money collected from tolls is used properly. A lot of money could be collected from people, but it might not go to fixing the roads like it should. Right now, it’s already tough to get the people in charge of the roads to do their jobs, and if they were richer, it would be even harder.

In France, the money meant for fixing roads is managed directly by the government. This money comes from the work that local farmers have to do to help fix the roads and from some of the government’s budget that the king decides to use for this purpose.

In the past, local leaders managed this work without needing to listen to the king. But now, everything is controlled by a government official who takes orders from the king’s council. This shows how the government is getting more power and taking control of money meant for public services. 

In France, the main roads that connect big cities are usually well maintained, and in some areas, they are even better than many of the main roads in England. However, the smaller roads, which are the majority, are often ignored and can be really hard to travel on. In some places, they are so bad that it’s dangerous to ride a horse, and only mules can be safely used for travel.
