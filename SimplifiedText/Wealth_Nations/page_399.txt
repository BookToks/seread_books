The balance of what a country produces and what it consumes is different from what we call the balance of trade. This balance can happen even if a country doesn’t trade with other countries at all. It can also apply to the entire world, where wealth, population, and progress can either grow or decline over time.

A country can produce more than it consumes, even if its trade balance looks bad. For example, a country might buy more from other countries than it sells for many years. During this time, all the gold and silver it receives might be sent back out right away. The money people use might change from coins to paper, and the debts it owes to other countries might keep getting bigger. Still, the real wealth from what the country produces each year could actually be growing a lot more. The situation of the North American colonies and their trade with Great Britain before the current problems started shows that this can really happen.

Merchants and manufacturers want to sell their goods not just at home but also in other countries. Since their country doesn’t control foreign nations, they can’t always get special rights there. So, they usually have to ask for help to encourage exports. One way to help is through something called drawbacks. This means allowing merchants to get back some or all of the taxes they paid on goods when they export them. This won’t make them export more than they would have without the tax. These incentives don’t change how much money goes into different jobs in the country; they just help keep businesses from losing money because of the tax. They don’t mess up the natural balance of jobs in society; they just help maintain it.
