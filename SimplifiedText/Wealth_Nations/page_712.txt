If jobs and professions are not treated equally with other trades, they would lose popularity and go back to being seen as just regular jobs. 

The pay for government jobs isn’t set by competition like regular jobs, so it doesn’t always match what the job really needs. In many places, the pay is actually higher than it should be because government workers often look out for themselves and their close friends. Because of this, government salaries can handle being taxed pretty well. Plus, people usually envy those who have public jobs, especially the ones that pay a lot. So, taxing their salaries, even if it’s a bit more than other taxes, is usually accepted by the public. 

For example, in England, when a land tax was set at four shillings for every pound of income, it was popular to tax government salaries over a hundred pounds at five shillings and sixpence. This included salaries for royal family members and military officers, but not those who were less envied. In England, there aren’t any other direct taxes on workers’ wages.

Taxes that are meant to be fair for everyone, no matter what kind of income they have, are called capitation taxes and taxes on things people buy. Everyone has to pay these taxes, whether it’s from their land rent, business profits, or job wages. 

If capitation taxes try to match how much money each person has, they become unfair. A person’s wealth can change every day, and figuring it out without a really annoying investigation that happens every year is hard. So, how much someone pays often depends on how the tax collectors feel, making it random and unpredictable. 

If capitation taxes are based on a person’s social rank instead of their actual wealth, they can also be unfair. People with the same rank can have very different amounts of money.
