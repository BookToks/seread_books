The division of labor, which brings many benefits, didn't come from any smart plan by people. Instead, it happened slowly because of a natural tendency in humans to trade and exchange things.

This tendency might be something we are born with, or it could be a result of our ability to think and talk. But that's not what we need to focus on right now. This trait is found in all humans and not in any other animals, which don't seem to understand trading. 

For example, two greyhounds chasing the same hare might look like they are working together. Each dog tries to corner the hare based on what the other dog is doing. But this isn't because they made a deal; it's just because they both want the same thing at that moment. You never see a dog trading one bone for another with another dog. Animals don’t signal to each other about ownership or make trades.

When an animal wants something from a person or another animal, it usually has to win them over. A puppy might cuddle up to its mom, or a spaniel might try to get its owner's attention while they’re eating to get some food. Humans sometimes do the same thing to get what they want from others. But in a busy society, people can’t always take the time to make friends with everyone they need help from. 

Unlike most animals that can live independently once they grow up, humans often need help from others. It's not enough to just hope for kindness; people are more likely to get what they need if they can work together.
