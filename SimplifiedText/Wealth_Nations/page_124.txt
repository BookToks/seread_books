Adam Smith talks about how people who own land near the sea can charge rent for it, just like they do for regular farmland. 

In places like the Shetland Islands, there are a lot of fish in the sea, which helps the people living there get food. But to catch those fish, they need a place to live on land. The rent that the landowner charges depends not just on what the farmer can earn from the land, but also from the fish they catch. Sometimes, part of the rent is even paid with fish. This is a rare situation where rent is included in the price of fish.

Rent is basically the cost of using the land, and it’s often set high because it doesn’t really depend on how much the landowner has spent to improve the land. Instead, it depends on how much the farmer can pay. 

When farmers sell their crops, they need to make enough money to cover their costs and make a profit. If they sell their crops for more than that, the extra money goes to the landowner as rent. If they don’t make enough, then there’s no rent for the landowner. Whether they make enough money depends on how much people want to buy the crops.

Some crops will always sell for a higher price, which means they will always provide rent for the landowner. Other crops might sell for a higher price sometimes and not at other times, depending on different factors.

It’s important to know that rent affects prices differently than wages and profits do. When wages and profits are high or low, they influence the price of goods. But rent is the result of those prices. If the price of a product is high, it can lead to high rent, but if the price is low, the rent might also be low or even nothing at all. 

We need to look at two types of crops: those that always provide some rent and those that might or might not provide rent. Also, we should consider how the value of these crops changes over time.
