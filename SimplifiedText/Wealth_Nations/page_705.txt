The Wealth of Nations

There are rules that say property transfers need to be recorded in a public or private register, and there are fees for this registration. Taxes have often been placed on the transfer of property when someone dies, as well as on property transfers between living people. These transactions could have been taxed directly instead.

One example is a tax called the vicesima hereditatum, or the twentieth penny, which was introduced by Augustus in ancient Rome. This tax was charged on property passed down from someone who died to someone who is alive. A writer named Dion Cassius explains that this tax applied to all inheritances, gifts, and donations when someone died, except for those given to close family members and the poor.

A similar tax exists in the Netherlands. Here, the tax on inheritances depends on how closely related the person is, ranging from five to thirty percent of the total value. Gifts or inheritances to family members, like from husband to wife or vice versa, are taxed at a lower rate. However, direct inheritances from parents to children are not taxed. 

When a father dies, his children who lived with him often don’t gain much money and might even lose some because they no longer have his income or support. It would be unfair to tax them on what they inherit because they are already facing a loss. But for children who have moved out and are financially independent, any inheritance they receive could actually help them, so it might be reasonable to tax that.

In the past, there were taxes on land transfers, both when someone died and when living people exchanged land. These taxes were a major source of income for kings in Europe. When a person inherited land from a vassal of the crown, they usually had to pay a fee, often equal to a year’s rent, to receive the land.
