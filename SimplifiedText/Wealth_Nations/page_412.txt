Adam Smith

Some people have tried really hard to keep the rewards for growing corn going. 

The wealthy landowners in our country set high taxes on selling foreign corn, which made it almost impossible to sell, and they created rewards for growing corn. They copied what our manufacturers did. By doing this, they made sure they had control over the local market and tried to stop it from being flooded with too much corn. They wanted to make corn more valuable, just like manufacturers did with their products. 

However, they might not have realized that corn is different from most other goods. When you give local wool or linen manufacturers a chance to sell their products for a higher price, you actually make those goods worth more. This means they can earn more money and can pay their workers better or hire more people. You are really helping those businesses grow and getting more workers involved in making those products. 

But when you try to raise the price of corn, it doesn’t actually make it more valuable. It doesn’t help farmers or landowners earn more money or grow more corn because they can’t hire more workers to help them. The true value of corn is based on how much work it can support, and changing its price doesn’t change that. No rewards or control over the market can change its real value. The value of corn is always linked to how much work it can provide for people. 

Unlike wool or linen, corn is what we use to measure the real value of everything else. The value of other goods is determined by how their prices compare to the price of corn. The real value of corn stays the same no matter what happens with prices.
