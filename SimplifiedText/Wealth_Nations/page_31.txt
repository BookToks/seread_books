The Wealth of Nations talks about how people value things based on the work that went into making them. When you buy something, its value is linked to how much work someone put into it. 

However, figuring out how much work is in different jobs can be tricky. Just looking at the time spent on two different tasks doesn’t always help. For example, one hour of hard work might be worth more than two hours of an easy job. Also, some jobs take years to learn, which adds to their value. But it’s hard to measure how tough or creative a job is. 

When people trade different things, they usually consider these factors, but it’s not done with a perfect system. Instead, it’s based on how people negotiate and what feels fair enough to keep things running smoothly in everyday life. 

Most of the time, people trade goods for other goods rather than for labor. It’s easier for people to understand the value of a specific item than to think about how much work went into it. An item is something you can see and touch, while labor is more of an idea. 

Once money became the main way to trade, people started exchanging their goods for money instead of directly for other goods. For example, a butcher doesn’t usually trade meat for bread or beer directly. Instead, he sells his meat for money at the market and then uses that money to buy bread and beer. The amount of money he gets for his meat decides how much bread and beer he can buy later. So, it makes more sense for him to think of his meat’s value in terms of money rather than in terms of bread and beer. He would rather say his meat costs three or four pence per pound instead of saying it’s worth a certain amount of bread or beer.
