Adam Smith said that the precious metals, like gold and silver, were not as easy to find in India as they were in Europe. But precious stones were more common in India. Because of this, gold and silver would trade for more precious stones and a lot more food in India than in Europe. This means that diamonds, which are super fancy, would cost less in India, and food, which everyone needs, would cost a lot less too.

However, the amount of food that workers can buy with their wages is lower in India and China compared to most of Europe. So, even though food is cheaper in India, workers earn less money, which means their wages buy them less food. In places where the skills and industries are similar, the price of most things made by workers usually matches the price of their wages. Even though China and India are not as advanced as Europe, they are still pretty close in terms of manufacturing skills. This means that the prices of most products are lower in those countries than in Europe.

In Europe, transporting goods over land makes everything more expensive. It takes more work and money to move materials and finished products to the market. But in China and India, there are many rivers and canals that make moving goods easier and cheaper, which helps lower prices even more. Because of all these reasons, sending gold and silver from Europe to India is a smart move. There arenâ€™t many things that sell for a better price there, and you can get a lot more for your money in India compared to what you spent in Europe. 

Also, it's better to send silver instead of gold to India. In China and many other places in India, you can trade ten or twelve ounces of silver for one ounce of gold. But in Europe, you need fourteen or fifteen ounces of silver for the same amount of gold. So, when sending goods, silver is a better choice.
