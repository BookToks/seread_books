Adam Smith talks about how landlords and farmers can't really improve their land or grow the best crops because they have to share profits with the church, which doesn't pay for any of the costs. For a long time, the growing of madder, a plant used for dye, was mostly done in certain areas of Europe where the church tax didn't apply. This gave those areas a big advantage. Recently, England started allowing madder farming by charging a flat fee instead of the church tax.

In many places in Europe and Asia, the government gets money from land taxes based on how much the land produces, not just how much rent it gets. For example, in China, the government takes one-tenth of what farmers grow. This amount is usually low, sometimes only one-thirtieth of what they produce. In the past, farmers in Bengal had to give one-fifth of their crops to the government, just like in ancient Egypt.

In Asia, these land taxes make the government care about improving the land. Leaders in China and Bengal, as well as in ancient Egypt, focused on building good roads and canals to help farmers sell more of their crops. But with church taxes, the money is split into tiny pieces, so no one really benefits from improving the land. A local church leader wouldn’t bother building a road to help farmers in their area sell more crops because it wouldn't help them directly.

Taxes for the government can have some benefits, but when they’re for the church, they mostly just cause problems. Taxes on what land produces can be collected in different ways, either by taking a portion of the crops or by charging a set amount of money. Sometimes, a local church leader or a person with a small estate might find some benefits from these taxes.
