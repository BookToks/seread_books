The Wealth of Nations

Goods taken out for home use don’t have to pay taxes. If they are sent out of the country, they can be tax-free too, as long as there’s a guarantee that they will be exported. People who sell these goods, whether in bulk or individually, must always allow customs officers to check their stock. They also need to prove that they paid taxes on everything in their shops or storage. Right now, taxes on imported rum are collected this way, and this method could work for other imported goods too, as long as the taxes are only on a few common items. If taxes were applied to almost everything like they are now, it would be hard to find enough storage space, and delicate items that need special care couldn’t be safely stored anywhere but with their owners.

If this new system could stop a lot of smuggling, even with high taxes, and if taxes were sometimes raised or lowered to make the most money for the government, then it’s likely that the government could make just as much money from taxes on a few common goods as it does now. This would make the tax system simpler and clearer, similar to how taxes on certain goods are handled. Right now, the government loses money when foreign goods are sent back out and then brought back in for local use, but this new system would fix that. If we also got rid of extra payments for exporting local products that aren’t really needed, the government could end up making just as much money as before.

If this system change doesn’t hurt public revenue, it would definitely help the country’s trade and manufacturing. The trade on untaxed goods, which is most of them, would be completely free and could happen with great benefits from anywhere in the world. This would include all the basic needs for life and all the materials needed for making things. As long as essential items could be imported freely, it would be a big win.
