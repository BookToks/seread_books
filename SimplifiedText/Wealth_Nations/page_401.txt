The Wealth of Nations talks about how certain goods are imported and exported. When we export goods, we don’t get back any of the taxes we paid on them. Our manufacturers don’t want even a little bit of foreign goods coming in because they’re worried that these goods might compete with what they sell. Because of this, we can only import certain items like fancy silks and printed fabrics.

We don’t even want to help transport French goods. We’d rather miss out on making money than let our rivals profit from us. We still keep a lot of the taxes on French goods when we export them.

There used to be a rule that let us get back more than half the taxes we paid on wine when we exported it. The government wanted to encourage wine trade back then. Other taxes that were added later also allowed us to get back the full amount when we exported goods. However, since we had to pay these taxes upfront, it made it hard to make a profit from trading wine. 

Only a small part of the tax on wine could be refunded when we exported it, and none of the taxes from certain years were refundable. Some new taxes from 1779 and 1781 could be refunded when we exported other goods, including wine. The last tax on wine from 1780 could also be refunded, but with so many other heavy taxes, it’s unlikely that we would ever export a lot of wine. These rules applied to all places we could legally export to, except for the British colonies in America.

An act from Charles II said that Great Britain had the exclusive right to supply the colonies with European goods, including wine. Since our North American and West Indian colonies have such a long coastline, this was a big deal.
