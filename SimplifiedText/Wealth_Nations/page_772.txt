Adam Smith talks about how Britain could improve its money situation by changing its tax system. If they applied the same taxes to all parts of the British Empire, they could collect a lot more money. But to do this fairly, they would need to let people from those areas have a say in the British Parliament. Each area should have a voice based on how much tax they pay, just like Great Britain does.

However, there are powerful people and groups who might not want this change, making it hard to achieve. Even though it’s tough to know if this idea is possible, it’s still worth thinking about how the British tax system could work for everyone in the Empire. It could show how much money could be made and how it might help different areas be happier and more successful. This idea might seem a bit unrealistic, but it’s not completely useless.

The main types of taxes in Britain include land tax, stamp duties, and customs and excise duties. 

Ireland and the American and West Indian plantations could actually pay a land tax better than Great Britain. If a landlord doesn’t have to pay other taxes, they can handle a land tax more easily. In places where landlords have to pay tithes, it takes away more of their income than a land tax would. Tithes can sometimes take up more than a quarter of what the landlord actually earns from the land after paying for everything else.

If there were no tithes in Britain or Ireland, landlords could pay an extra six or seven million in land taxes without it being too much of a burden.
