The Wealth of Nations

A long time ago, ship-builders were mostly found in a few nations, and they were the only ones trying to build ships. 

Among all the countries by the Mediterranean Sea, Egypt was probably the first to really improve farming and manufacturing. Upper Egypt is only a few miles wide along the Nile River. In Lower Egypt, the Nile splits into many canals, which helped connect big cities, small towns, and even farmhouses, kind of like how rivers in Holland connect places today. This easy way to travel by water likely helped Egypt grow and improve early on.

Other places like Bengal in India and parts of eastern China also had old improvements in farming and manufacturing, but we don’t have strong historical proof of how far back those improvements go. In Bengal, the Ganges River and other big rivers create lots of canals, just like the Nile does in Egypt. In eastern China, many rivers connect to form a huge network of canals that are even bigger than those in Egypt or Bengal.

Interestingly, the ancient Egyptians, Indians, and Chinese didn’t really focus on trading with other countries. Instead, they became wealthy mainly through their inland waterways. 

In Africa and northern Asia, like ancient Scythia and modern Tartary and Siberia, people have mostly stayed in a rough and uncivilized state throughout history. The Sea of Tartary is frozen and can’t be used for navigation. Even though some big rivers run through that area, they are too far apart to help with trade and communication. 

In Africa, there aren’t big seas like the Baltic or Adriatic in Europe, or the Mediterranean and Euxine in both Europe and Asia, that could help with maritime trade into the continent's interior. The big rivers in Africa are also too far apart to allow for significant inland navigation. Plus, any trade that could happen on a river that doesn’t connect to others is limited.
