Adam Smith talks about looking closely at all the things we use in our daily lives, like our clothes and furniture. 

He mentions the simple shirt we wear, the shoes on our feet, and the bed we sleep in. He also talks about the kitchen where we cook our food, the coal we use for cooking, and how it comes from deep in the ground, often transported over long distances. 

Then, he lists all the kitchen tools, the furniture on our table, and the plates we eat from. He even includes the people who make our bread and beer, and the glass windows that let in light and keep out bad weather. 

All these things show how much work goes into making our lives comfortable. Even the simplest person in a civilized country relies on the help of thousands of people to have what they need, even if it seems easy. 

When we compare this to the fancy lifestyles of the rich, it might look simple. But actually, the way a hardworking peasant lives might not be that different from a European prince. In fact, the peasant's life is probably much better than that of some African kings who rule over many people living in very basic conditions.
