Adam Smith was saying that if the economy could grow quickly, it might be able to pay off all its debts in a few years. This would help the country get back to being strong and healthy. While this was happening, people could be relieved from some heavy taxes, especially on things they really need or use to make stuff.

If the working poor had to pay less, they could live better and work for less money. This would help them sell their products for less, which would make more people want to buy them. When more people want to buy things, more workers are needed, which would help the working poor get better jobs and improve their lives. They would buy more things, and this would help the government earn money from the taxes on those products.

However, the money the government gets from taxes might not go up right away, even if more people are paying them. Some areas of the country would need time to adjust to these new taxes. Even when taxes were the same everywhere, they wouldn’t always bring in the same amount of money based on how many people lived there. In poorer areas, people buy less of the things that are taxed, and in places with fewer people, it’s easier to avoid paying taxes.

For example, in Scotland, people who are less wealthy don’t drink much beer, so the taxes on beer and ale don’t bring in as much money compared to England. In Scotland, the taxes on things like whiskey and other goods also bring in less money because people buy less and it’s easier to avoid paying those taxes. In Ireland, the poorer people are even worse off than in Scotland, and many areas have very few people living there. So, in Ireland, people might buy even less of the taxed items than in Scotland, and it’s just as easy to avoid paying those taxes.

In America and the West Indies, even the poorest white people are better off than those in England, and they tend to buy more luxury items.
