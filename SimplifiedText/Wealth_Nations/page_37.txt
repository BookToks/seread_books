The Wealth of Nations

In many places, the history of money is better known because it has been written about more often. So, we usually have to rely on what we know, even if it doesn’t perfectly match the current prices of work. I will compare these things later on.

As countries developed their industries, they found it useful to make money out of different metals. They used gold for big payments, silver for medium purchases, and copper or other cheap metals for small buys. However, they usually picked one metal to be the main measure of value. This choice often depended on which metal they started using first for trading. Once they chose a standard, they tended to stick with it, even when they didn’t need to anymore.

For example, the Romans only had copper money until just before the first Punic War, when they began to use silver coins. So, copper was the main measure of value in Rome. They kept track of money and the value of property using copper coins called asses or silver coins called sestertii. The sestertius was worth two and a half asses. Even though the sestertius started as a silver coin, its value was still based on copper. If someone owed a lot of money in Rome, it meant they owed a lot of copper coins.

The northern tribes that settled where the Roman Empire used to be seemed to have silver money from the start and didn’t use gold or copper coins for a long time. There were silver coins in England during the Saxon times, but gold coins didn’t appear until Edward III's reign, and copper coins didn’t show up until James I's time. So, in England and likely in other modern European countries, people usually keep track of money and the value of goods in silver. When we talk about someone’s wealth, we usually mention pounds instead of guineas.

Originally, in all countries, you could only make legal payments with the coin that was considered the main measure of value. In England, gold wasn’t seen as legal money for a long time after it was first used.
