Adam Smith says that society can produce enough food for everyone. This means that many people can work on making other things or fulfilling other needs and wants. Things like clothes, homes, furniture, and decorations are what most people want.

A rich person doesn’t eat more food than a poor person. The food might be different in quality, and preparing it might take more effort, but the amount is pretty similar. However, if you look at the big house and fancy clothes of a rich person compared to the small home and few clothes of a poor person, you can see a huge difference in what they have. 

Everyone has a limit to how much food they can eat because of their stomach size. But when it comes to things like nice buildings, clothes, and furniture, there seems to be no limit to how much people want. So, people who have extra food are usually happy to trade it for other things they want. What they don’t need for food can be used to satisfy endless desires for nicer things.

Poor people work hard to get food, and they try to make things that the rich want. To get food more reliably, they compete to make their work cheaper and better. As more food is produced, more workers are needed, and they can divide their tasks to work more efficiently. This means they can create more materials than there are workers. Because of this, there’s a demand for all kinds of materials that can be used for building, clothing, and furniture, including valuable metals and stones.

Food is not just the main source of rent; it also helps determine the value of everything else produced from the land. This value comes from how much better people can work to produce food by improving and farming the land. 

However, not all products from the land always make money. Even in well-farmed areas, sometimes there isn’t enough demand for them to sell for more than what it costs to pay workers and cover other expenses needed to sell them. Whether they do or not can vary.
