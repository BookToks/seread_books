The Wealth of Nations

Taxes affect not just certain sellers, but everyone—every farmer, manufacturer, merchant, and shopkeeper has to deal with tax collectors all the time. In places where this kind of tax exists, people can’t produce goods for sale far away. Instead, what they make has to match what people in their area want. Ustaritz blames this tax for ruining Spain’s manufacturing. He could also say it hurt farming because it applies to both manufactured goods and raw products from the land.

In Naples, there’s a similar tax of three percent on all contracts, including sales contracts. This tax is lighter than the one in Spain, and most towns can pay a fixed amount instead. They can decide how to collect this fixed amount, usually in a way that doesn’t mess up local trade. So, the Neapolitan tax isn’t as damaging as the Spanish one.

In Great Britain, there’s a pretty consistent tax system that mostly keeps local trade free. People can move goods from one end of the country to the other without needing special permits or being checked by tax officers. There are a few exceptions, but they don’t really disrupt important local trade. Goods moved along the coast do need certificates, but most items, except coal, don’t have extra taxes. This freedom in local trade, thanks to the uniform tax system, is a big reason why Great Britain is doing so well. If Ireland and the colonies had the same freedom, the whole empire would probably be even better off.

In France, the different tax laws in each province mean there are a lot of tax officers needed at the borders and within provinces. They try to stop certain goods from coming in or make sure they pay certain taxes, which disrupts local trade. Some provinces can pay a fixed amount instead of dealing with all these taxes.
