Adam Smith talks about how some jobs are really important for society but don’t seem to help individuals directly. The government needs to support these jobs so that the people in them can make a living. This support can come in different ways, like giving special honors or creating a clear ranking system. For example, people who work in finance, the navy, or government positions are part of this group.

At first, it might seem like religious leaders should be in the same category as important jobs like lawyers and doctors. People who believe in their teachings might support them, and this could motivate them to work harder and get better at what they do. 

However, if we look closer, we see that this motivation can actually be a problem. In many religions that aren’t the true ones, it can lead to false beliefs and superstitions. Religious leaders might try to make themselves seem more important by making their followers hate other beliefs and always coming up with new ideas to keep their audience interested. They might ignore what’s true or right just to attract more followers. 

In the end, the government might find that trying to save money by not paying these religious leaders properly can backfire. It’s often better for the government to pay them a regular salary so they don’t have to work too hard to keep their followers from looking for other leaders. This way, even though these religious roles started for spiritual reasons, they can actually help society in a political way.
