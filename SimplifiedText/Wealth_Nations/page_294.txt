Adam Smith said that people in business might try to hurt each other, but they won't hurt the public. For example, the amount of grocery items that can be sold in a town depends on how many people want to buy them. So, the money that can be used in grocery stores can't be more than what is needed to buy those items. 

If two grocery stores compete against each other, they'll probably sell things for cheaper than if only one store was around. If there are twenty stores, the competition will be even tougher, making it less likely for them to team up to raise prices. Some stores might go out of business because of this competition, but that’s something they have to deal with. Overall, this competition helps keep prices lower for customers and makes sure stores buy items at fair prices. 

Sometimes, a store might trick a customer into buying something they don’t need. But this isn't a big deal and wouldn't be solved by limiting the number of stores. For example, having a lot of bars doesn’t cause people to drink too much; it’s actually the other way around—people’s drinking habits create the need for more bars. 

The people who invest money in these businesses are also working hard. Their work helps create products that can be sold, and it usually adds to the price of those products to cover their living costs. The profits that farmers, manufacturers, merchants, and retailers make come from the prices of the goods produced and sold. 

However, if the same amount of money is used in different types of businesses, it can lead to different amounts of work being created and can change how much value is added to the community’s goods and services. The money that retailers use helps them make profits and also supports the merchants they buy from, allowing those merchants to keep running their businesses. The retailer is the main worker who directly benefits from this money, and their profits contribute to the overall value of what the community produces. 

The money that wholesale merchants use also supports farmers and manufacturers, helping them keep their businesses going.
