Adam Smith talks about how in ancient times, citizens learned important skills in public places, like gyms, and it didn't matter if they learned them privately as long as they were good at it. The republics rewarded people with prizes and badges for being really good at these skills. Winning a prize in big games like the Olympics was a big deal, not just for the winner but for their whole family too.

Every citizen had to be ready to serve in the army for a certain number of years, which meant they needed to learn these skills to be fit for duty. Over time, if the government doesn't support military training, people start to lose those skills and the fighting spirit of the community fades away. We can see this happening in modern Europe. The safety of any society relies a lot on the fighting spirit of its people. Nowadays, just having that spirit isn’t enough without a well-trained army. But if everyone had a soldier's mindset, we wouldn’t need as many soldiers. This would also reduce fears about a standing army taking away freedoms, because a united people would help protect against outside threats and keep the army in check.

In ancient Greece and Rome, the systems they had were better at keeping the fighting spirit alive than today’s militias. Their systems were simpler and once set up, they worked well without needing much help from the government. In contrast, modern militias need constant attention from the government to function properly, and without that, they often fall apart. The old systems taught everyone how to use weapons, while today, only a small number of people learn these skills, except maybe in places like Switzerland. A coward, someone who can’t defend themselves or fight back, clearly lacks an important part of being a strong citizen.
