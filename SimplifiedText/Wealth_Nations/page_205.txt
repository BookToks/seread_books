When a country produces enough food, it’s easier to decide how much to pay people for their work or if they should get paid more at all. When farming gets better and more land is used for growing corn, the price of meat goes up. This is because the land that grows animals is now being used for corn, which makes it more valuable for farmers and landowners. 

On the other hand, the price of vegetables goes down because better farming makes them more plentiful. New farming methods also bring in cheaper vegetables that need less land and work, like potatoes and corn. These are two big improvements that Europe got from better trade and shipping. 

Also, many vegetables that used to only be grown in small gardens can now be grown in larger fields with plows, like turnips, carrots, and cabbages. So, when the price of one type of food goes up, the price of another type usually goes down. This makes it trickier to figure out if the increase in one food’s price is balanced by the decrease in another’s. 

For example, the price of meat has been high for a long time in England, except maybe for pork. If the price of other meats goes up, it won’t really hurt poorer people that much. They are more affected by the drop in potato prices, which helps them out more than a rise in the price of chicken or fish. 

Right now, when there isn’t enough food, the high price of corn is tough for poor people. But when there’s enough food, and corn is at a normal price, the rise in prices of other basic foods doesn’t hurt them much. They actually struggle more with the higher prices of things like salt, soap, leather, candles, and beer, which are affected by taxes.
