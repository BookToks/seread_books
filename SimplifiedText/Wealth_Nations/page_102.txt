Adam Smith talks about how some people make a living by renting out rooms, but they often rely on that income to support their families. In places like Paris and Edinburgh, people who rent out rooms usually have no other way to earn money. So, the rent they charge has to cover not just the house costs but also all their family expenses.

Now, let's talk about the unfairness caused by Europe's rules. These rules create big differences in how people can work and earn money, even when everyone is supposed to have the same freedom. Europe does this in three main ways. First, it limits the number of people who can compete for certain jobs, making it harder for others to join in. Second, it makes some jobs way more competitive than they should be. Third, it stops people and resources from moving freely between jobs and places.

The first way Europe creates unfairness is by keeping the competition for some jobs low. This happens because of special privileges given to certain groups. For example, if a trade group has exclusive rights, only a few people can compete in that town. To join this group, you usually have to complete an apprenticeship under a qualified master. The rules of these groups often limit how many apprentices a master can have and how long they must train. This is meant to keep the number of competitors low. 

In Sheffield, for instance, a cutler can only have one apprentice at a time because of a local rule. In Norfolk and Norwich, a master weaver can only have two apprentices, or they’ll have to pay a fine. Similarly, a master hatter can only have two apprentices anywhere in England or its colonies, or they’ll face a fine too.
