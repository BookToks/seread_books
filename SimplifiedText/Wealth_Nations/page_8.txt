Adam Smith talks about how some people suffer from diseases and hunger, while others live comfortably. In advanced societies, many people don’t work at all, but they still use up resources that took a lot more work to produce than what most workers create. Because of this, there’s usually enough for everyone, and even the poorest workers can have a better life than people living in primitive conditions.

The first part of this study looks at why work has become more productive and how its results are shared among different groups of people. The amount of goods a country produces depends on how many people are working and how many are not. The number of productive workers is connected to the amount of money and resources available to hire them and how those resources are used.

Countries that are skilled in using labor have taken different approaches to managing it, and not all of these approaches have been good for production. Some countries support industry and business more, while others focus on farming. Since the fall of the Roman Empire, Europe has favored city industries over farming. The reasons for this shift are explained in the next part of the study.

Even though these different approaches may have started because of the interests of certain groups, they have led to different ideas about economics. Some people think city industries are more important, while others believe farming is key. These ideas have had a big impact on how societies develop.
