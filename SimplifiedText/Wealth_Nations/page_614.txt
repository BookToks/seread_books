Instead of the old system, a new top court was set up with a chief justice and three judges, all picked by the king. In Europe, to be able to vote at their big meetings, a person now needed to have at least a thousand pounds, which is double the original price of a company share. Also, to vote, they had to own that amount for at least a year if they bought it themselves, instead of just six months like before.

Before, the twenty-four directors were chosen every year, but now each director will serve for four years. However, six of them will leave every year and can't be re-elected when the new directors are chosen. Because of these changes, people hoped that the courts would act more seriously and steadily than they did in the past.

But even with these changes, it seems impossible to make these courts good enough to run a huge empire. Most members just don’t care enough about the empire’s success to pay attention to what would help it. Sometimes, a wealthy person buys a thousand-pound share in India stock just to have a say in the owner meetings. This gives them some power, even if they don’t get any of the profits directly. The directors, who make important decisions, are influenced by the owners who elect them and can sometimes change their choices about what happens in India.

As long as they can have this power for a few years and help out their friends, they often don’t care much about the profits or even the value of their shares. They rarely think about the empire’s well-being, even though their vote gives them some say in its government. No other leaders have ever been so uninterested in the happiness or suffering of their people, or in the success or failure of their lands, as many of the owners of this trading company are. This lack of concern was likely made worse by some of the new rules that came from the government’s investigation. For example, the House of Commons decided that when the £1,400,000 loaned to the company by the government...
