The real rent of land can lower the actual wealth of the landlord, making it harder for them to buy things like labor or products made by other people.

Every country’s total yearly output from land and labor can be split into three parts: the rent from land, the wages for workers, and the profits from businesses. These three parts provide income to three different groups of people: those who earn from rent, those who earn from wages, and those who earn from profits. These groups are the main parts of any civilized society, and the income from these groups supports everyone else.

The interests of the landowners are closely tied to the overall interests of society. What helps one group usually helps the other, and what harms one group usually harms the other too. When the public talks about rules for business or community safety, landowners can’t mislead the conversation to only benefit themselves, especially if they understand their own interests well. However, they often lack this understanding. Unlike the other groups, their income doesn’t require hard work or planning; it comes to them easily. This comfort can make them lazy and less aware of how public rules can affect everyone.

The interests of workers, who earn wages, are also closely linked to society's interests. Workers earn the most when there’s a high demand for jobs or when more people are being hired each year. If the society's wealth stays the same, their wages drop to just enough to support a family. If society is struggling, their wages can fall even lower. While landowners might benefit more when society is doing well, workers are the ones who suffer the most when things go bad. Even though workers’ interests are tied to society’s, they often don’t understand this connection. Their busy lives leave them little time to learn about these issues, and their education and daily habits usually don’t prepare them to think critically about it, even if they had the information.
