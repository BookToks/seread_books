After food, clothing and shelter are two of the biggest needs for people.

Land, when it's not used much, can provide materials for clothing and shelter to more people than it can feed. But when the land is improved, it can sometimes feed more people than it can provide materials for, at least in the way people want and are willing to pay for. 

In the first situation, there’s usually a lot of materials available, which often makes them worth very little. In the second situation, there’s often not enough, which makes them more valuable. When there’s a lot, much of it goes to waste, and the price of what is used only covers the cost of getting it ready to use, so it doesn’t give any money to the landowner. But when there’s a shortage, everything gets used, and people are often willing to pay more than it costs to sell it. This means the price can give some money to the landowner.

The skins of big animals were the first materials for clothing. In groups of hunters and shepherds, who mostly eat the meat of these animals, each person, while getting food, ends up with more clothing materials than they can wear. If there was no trade with other places, most of these materials would be wasted. This probably happened with the hunting tribes in North America before Europeans arrived, who now trade their extra animal skins for blankets, guns, and alcohol, which gives those skins some value. 

Today, even the most basic societies that own land have some trade with other countries and find that their richer neighbors want the clothing materials their land produces. Since they can’t use all of it at home, this raises the price and gives some money to the landowner. For example, when Highland cattle were mostly used locally, selling their hides became an important part of trade for that area, and what they got in return helped increase the rent for Highland land. Similarly, England’s wool, which couldn’t be used or sold at home back then, found buyers in the richer and busier country of Flanders, and its price helped pay some rent for the land it came from. In places that weren’t better farmed than England was back then, or than the Highlands of Scotland are now, similar things happened.
