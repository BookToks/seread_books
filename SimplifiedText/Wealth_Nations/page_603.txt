The Wealth of Nations

The government is run by a group of nine people who meet in London. These people are chosen every year by the free members of the company from London, Bristol, and Liverpool, with three from each city. No one can stay in this position for more than three years in a row. If someone on the committee needs to be removed, the board of trade can do it, but they have to listen to the person’s side of the story first.

The committee is not allowed to send slaves from Africa or bring African goods into Great Britain. However, since they are responsible for keeping forts and military bases, they can send goods from Great Britain to Africa for that purpose. They can use up to eight hundred pounds from the money they get from the company to pay their clerks and agents in London, Bristol, and Liverpool, cover office rent in London, and pay for other management costs. Whatever money is left after paying these expenses can be shared among themselves as a reward for their work.

You might think that these rules would stop any unfair control over trade, but it seems that didn’t happen. Even though the company was given control of the fort in Senegal and its surrounding areas, the next year, the whole coast from a place called Sallee to Cape Rouge was taken away from them and made free for everyone in the country to trade. The company was suspected of limiting trade and creating an unfair monopoly. It’s not clear how they could do that with the rules in place, but some people in the House of Commons accused them of it. Since all the committee members are merchants and the people running the forts depend on them, it’s possible that the fort managers paid special attention to the shipments from the committee, which could lead to a real monopoly.

To help maintain the forts and military bases, Parliament gives them about £13,000 each year. The committee has to explain how they spend this money every year to a specific official, and then that report is shown to others.
