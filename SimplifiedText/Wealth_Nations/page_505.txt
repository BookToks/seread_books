The Wealth of Nations

There are a lot of people, maybe a hundred, who work directly for the Continental Congress, and then there are about five hundred thousand others who work under them. All of these people feel like they are more important now. 

Right now, almost everyone in the American government thinks they have a better job than they ever had before or even thought they could have. Unless they find something new to aim for, they will fight to keep their position. 

President Heynaut said that we now enjoy reading about small events from the Ligue that didn’t seem important back then. But at that time, everyone thought they were important. Many of the stories we have from that time were written by people who liked to make their roles seem bigger than they were. 

We all know how stubborn the city of Paris was when it defended itself against one of the best kings of France, even during a terrible famine. Most of the people there fought to keep their importance, which they knew would disappear if the old government came back. Our colonies might also fight hard to protect themselves against their mother country, just like Paris did against its king. 

In ancient times, people didn’t really understand the idea of representation. When people from one state wanted to become citizens of another, they had to go there in person to vote and discuss things. When most of the people in Italy became Roman citizens, it messed up the Roman Republic. It became impossible to tell who was a real Roman citizen. Anyone could show up at meetings and push out the real citizens, making decisions as if they belonged. 

But if America sent fifty or sixty new representatives to Parliament, the doorkeeper of the House of Commons wouldn’t have much trouble figuring out who was who. So, even though the Roman system fell apart when they joined with the allied states of Italy, it’s unlikely that something similar would happen in America.
