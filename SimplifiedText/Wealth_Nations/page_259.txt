The Bank of England is the biggest bank in Europe. It was created by a law on July 27, 1694. At that time, it lent the government £1,200,000, which meant the government had to pay back £100,000 a year, plus interest. The interest rate was really high at eight percent, which shows that the government wasn't trusted much back then.

In 1697, the bank was allowed to increase its money supply by adding £1,001,171. So, its total money now was £2,201,171. This extra money was meant to help improve the government's reputation. In 1696, some financial documents were losing value, and bank notes were also losing value, which made people doubt the bank.

Following a law, the bank gave the government another £400,000, making the total amount it had lent £1,600,000. By 1708, the government was seen as reliable enough to borrow money at six percent interest, which was the usual rate back then. The bank also canceled some government bills worth £1,775,027 and was allowed to raise more money from people. By 1703, the bank had a total of £4,402,343 and had lent the government £3,375,027.

In 1709, the bank raised more money by asking for 15 percent from its investors, which brought in £656,204. Then, in 1710, it asked for another 10 percent, adding £501,448. Because of these two actions, the bank's total money grew to £5,559,995.

According to a new law, the bank canceled two million in government bills. At this point, it had lent the government a total of £5,375,027. Another law allowed the bank to buy stock worth £4,000,000 from the South Sea Company. By 1722, because of the money it raised for this purchase, the bank's total money increased by £3,400,000. At this time, the bank had lent the public £9,375,027, but its total money was only £8,959,995.
