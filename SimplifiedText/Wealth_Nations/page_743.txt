The Wealth of Nations

In France, the small area called Milan is split into six provinces, and each one has its own tax rules for different goods. The even smaller area ruled by the duke of Parma is divided into three or four parts, each with its own tax system too. With such confusing management, only the rich soil and nice weather keep these places from becoming really poor and uncivilized.

Taxes on goods can be collected in two ways. One way is by government workers who are directly responsible to the government. The money they collect can change every year based on how much people buy. The other way is to let someone else collect the taxes for a fixed amount of money. This person can choose their own workers, but they still have to follow the law and report to that person. 

Collecting taxes this second way is usually not the best or cheapest option. The person collecting the taxes has to pay their workers and cover other costs, plus they want to make a profit. This profit can be really high. If the government ran the tax collection themselves, they could save that extra money. 

To collect a lot of money from taxes, you need either a lot of money upfront or a good reputation. This means only a few people can even try to do it. Among those few, even fewer have the right skills or experience. Because of this, the ones who can compete often decide to work together instead of against each other. When the tax collection is put up for auction, they might offer a lower amount than what it’s really worth.

In places where taxes are farmed out, the tax collectors often become the richest people around. Their wealth can make people angry, especially since they often show off their money in silly ways. The tax collectors don’t care much about the people who have to pay taxes; they don’t feel sorry for them at all.
