The Wealth of Nations

People often think that the way someone lives, like having a fancy car or walking, is what makes them rich or poor. But really, it’s the other way around. If someone is rich, they can afford a car; if someone is poor, they have to walk.

In the last hundred years, the price of grain was generally higher in both England and Scotland than it is now. This is a fact that we can be sure about. In Scotland, there are official records that show the prices of different grains in each county. If we needed more proof, we can see similar patterns in France and other parts of Europe. 

Even though grain was more expensive back then, the cost of labor was much lower. So, if workers could support their families back then, they should be doing even better now. For example, in Scotland, workers usually earned sixpence a day in summer and fivepence in winter a hundred years ago. Today, many workers in the Lowlands earn about eight pence a day, and some areas near Edinburgh and Glasgow pay even more, like ten pence or a shilling.

In England, farming, manufacturing, and trade improved a lot earlier than in Scotland. Because of this, the demand for workers went up, which made wages higher. So, even back then, workers in England earned more than those in Scotland. Wages have gone up since then, but it’s harder to tell exactly how much because they vary a lot in different places. For example, in 1614, a foot soldier earned eight pence a day, which is the same as today. This pay was likely based on what regular workers made since foot soldiers usually came from that group.
