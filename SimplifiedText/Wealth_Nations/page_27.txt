The Wealth of Nations

The first public stamps were put on metals to show how good they were when sold in stores. These stamps were meant to figure out the quality of the metal, which was really important. They were similar to the sterling mark on silver or the Spanish mark on gold bars. These marks were only on one side of the metal, showing how pure it was but not how heavy.

For example, Abraham paid Ephron 400 shekels of silver for a field. Even though this was considered money, it was weighed instead of counted, just like how gold bars and silver bars are handled today. Back in the day, the Saxon kings of England were paid with food and supplies instead of money. It was William the Conqueror who started paying them with actual money. However, this money was also weighed at first, not counted.

Weighing metals accurately was hard, so coins were created. These coins had stamps on both sides and sometimes even on the edges. This stamp showed both the quality and weight of the metal. Because of this, coins could be counted easily without needing to weigh them.

The names of the coins originally showed how much metal was in them. For example, during the time of Servius Tullius, who was the first to make money in Rome, the Roman as or pondo was a pound of good copper. It was divided into twelve ounces, just like our Troyes pound, with each ounce being a real ounce of copper. In Edward I's time, the English pound sterling was a pound of silver with a known quality. The Tower pound was a bit more than the Roman pound but less than the Troyes pound, which was used in England starting in the 18th year of Henry VIII's reign.

The French livre during Charlemagne's time was a pound of silver with a known quality too. The fair of Troyes in Champagne was popular among all European nations, and its weights and measures were well-known and respected. The Scottish pound, from Alexander the First to Robert Bruce, was also a pound of silver with the same weight and quality as the English pound sterling. English, French, and Scottish pennies originally all contained a real penny-weight of silver, which was one-twentieth of a pound.
