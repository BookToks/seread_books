The Wealth of Nations

Life can be tough sometimes, but that doesn’t mean the government isn’t smart. To stay independent, they’ve had to spend a lot on wars, which has led to big debts. 

Places like Holland and Zealand need to spend a lot just to keep from being taken over by the sea. This has made taxes pretty high in those areas. The way their government is set up helps keep Holland strong. 

Rich people and big businesses usually have a say in how the government runs things. They like being respected and are okay with making less money in Holland than they could elsewhere. Even though they don’t earn as much, their presence helps keep some jobs and businesses alive in the country. 

If something bad happened and the government changed, making it run by nobles and soldiers instead, the wealthy merchants would lose their influence. They wouldn’t want to stay in a place where they weren’t respected anymore. They would likely move away, taking their money and businesses with them, which would hurt Holland’s economy.
