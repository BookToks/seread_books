The Russian Empire had been at peace for almost twenty years, so most of its soldiers had never fought in a war. When the Spanish war started in 1739, England had also been at peace for about twenty-eight years. But the bravery of England's soldiers was still strong, especially during the attack on Carthagena, which was the first bad event of that war. Even though generals might forget some of their skills during a long peace, soldiers in a well-trained army usually remember how to be brave.

If a civilized country relies on a militia for defense, it can easily be defeated by a nearby barbaric nation. The many times that civilized countries in Asia were conquered by the Tartars show that a militia from a barbaric nation can be stronger than one from a civilized nation. A well-trained standing army is better than any militia. Such an army can only be supported by a wealthy and civilized nation, and it is the only way to protect that nation from attacks by poorer, barbaric neighbors. A standing army is essential for keeping a country civilized over time.

A well-trained standing army not only defends a civilized country but can also help a barbaric country become more civilized quickly. A standing army enforces the laws of the ruler across all parts of the empire and keeps some level of order in places that wouldn’t have it otherwise. If you look closely at the changes Peter the Great made in Russia, you'll see that they mostly involved creating a strong standing army. This army was key to carrying out and maintaining all his other reforms. The order and peace that Russia has enjoyed since then are mainly due to the influence of that army.

People who believe in republican ideas often worry about standing armies because they can threaten freedom. This is true when the interests of the army's leaders don’t align with the country's constitution. For example, Caesar's army destroyed the Roman Republic, and Cromwell's army kicked the long parliament out. However, if the ruler is also the general and the main nobles and leaders are in charge of the army, then the military is led by those who care the most about supporting the government.
