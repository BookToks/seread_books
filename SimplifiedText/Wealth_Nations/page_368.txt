Adam Smith talks about how farmers and country folks share information with each other. Unlike manufacturers, they don’t keep secrets and usually like to share new ideas that help them. Old Cato once said that honest work is the best and least troublesome. 

Farmers and country gentlemen live far apart, so they can’t easily work together like merchants and manufacturers who are in towns. Those town folks often try to keep their advantages to themselves, which leads them to create rules that limit foreign goods coming in, making it easier for them to sell their own products. 

To compete with these town merchants, farmers in Great Britain started asking for the same privileges, wanting to be the only ones to sell things like corn and meat. They might not have thought about how much less their business would be affected by free trade compared to the town merchants they were copying.

When a law stops foreign corn and cattle from coming in, it basically means that the country can’t grow beyond what its own land can produce. 

However, there are two situations where it can be good to put some limits on foreign goods to help local businesses. 

The first situation is when a certain industry is important for the country’s defense. For example, Great Britain needs a lot of sailors and ships to protect itself. So, the Navigation Act was created to help British sailors and ships have an advantage in trade. 

This law has some key rules. First, any ship that isn’t mostly owned and crewed by British people can’t trade with British colonies or work along the British coast. Second, many heavy items can only be brought into Great Britain on British ships.
