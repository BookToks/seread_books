The Wealth of Nations talks about fixing the problems caused by people's mistakes and unfairness, just like how our bodies heal from laziness and bad habits.

However, a big mistake in this idea is thinking that workers, manufacturers, and merchants don’t create anything valuable. Here are some points to show why this idea is wrong:

First, it's clear that these workers make enough each year to cover what they use and keep their businesses running. So, calling them unproductive doesn’t make sense. For example, we wouldn’t say a couple is unproductive just because they have two kids to replace them instead of having more. Farmers and laborers do produce extra goods, which is more than what workers in shops and factories do. But just because farmers produce more doesn’t mean the work of merchants and manufacturers is useless.

Second, it’s not fair to compare workers in shops and factories to servants. Servants don’t create anything that helps keep their jobs going. Their pay comes from their bosses, and the work they do usually disappears right after it’s done. In contrast, the work of manufacturers and merchants results in products that can be sold, which is why I consider them productive workers, while servants are not.

Third, it’s wrong to say that workers in shops, factories, and trade don’t help increase the wealth of society. Even if we assume their spending matches what they produce, it still doesn’t mean their work isn’t valuable.
