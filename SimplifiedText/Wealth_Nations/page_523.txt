The Wealth of Nations

To make linen cloth, we need at least three or four spinners for every weaver. Most of the work to prepare linen cloth goes into making linen yarn. But the spinners are usually poor women who work alone in different places without help. The big manufacturers make their money by selling the finished cloth, not from the spinners' work. They want to sell their products for a high price and buy materials for as low a price as possible.

To do this, they get the government to give them money for exporting their linen, charge high taxes on foreign linen, and even ban some types of French linen. This way, they can sell their own linen at higher prices. They also support bringing in foreign linen yarn to compete with local yarn, which helps them pay the spinners less. They try to keep wages low for both the weavers and the spinners. The system mainly benefits the rich and powerful, while the poor workers often get ignored or treated unfairly.

The money given for exporting linen and the tax breaks for importing foreign yarn were supposed to last for fifteen years but were extended a couple of times. They will end after the next session of parliament following June 24, 1786. The support for importing materials mainly focused on those from American colonies.

The first bounties for importing materials started around the early 1700s for naval supplies from America. This included timber for ships, hemp, tar, pitch, and turpentine. There was a bounty of £1 per ton for masting timber and £6 per ton for hemp, which also applied to imports from Scotland. These bounties stayed the same until they eventually ended, with the hemp bounty finishing on January 1, 1741, and the masting-timber bounty ending after the session of parliament right after June 24, 1781. The bounties for tar, pitch, and turpentine continued as well.
