Adam Smith talks about castles and how they were important strongholds for rulers. The people in charge of these castles acted like military leaders. They were the only military staff needed during peaceful times. Because of this, the money made from big pieces of land could usually cover the costs of running the government.

Today, in many European countries, the money made from all the land wouldn’t even be enough to cover what the government collects from people, even when things are calm. For example, in Great Britain, the government needs over ten million pounds each year just to pay for regular expenses, interest on debts, and to pay off some of those debts. But the land tax, which is a tax on land, only brings in less than two million pounds a year.

This land tax is supposed to be one-fifth of the rent from all the land, houses, and the interest from investments in Great Britain, except for money that’s lent to the government or used for farming. A big part of this tax comes from the rent of houses and the interest on investments. For instance, the land tax in London is about £123,399, while in Westminster it’s around £63,092, and in the palaces of Whitehall and St. James’s, it’s about £30,754.

A portion of the land tax is also collected from other cities and towns, mostly from house rents or business investments. Overall, the total money from all land rents, house rents, and investment interest, except for what’s lent to the government or used for farming, is estimated to be around ten million pounds a year, which is what the government collects from people during peaceful times. The way Great Britain figures out the land tax is probably much lower than the actual value, although in some areas, it might be close to the real amount. Some people think that just the rent from the land alone could be around twenty million pounds, but this guess is mostly random and could be too high or too low.
