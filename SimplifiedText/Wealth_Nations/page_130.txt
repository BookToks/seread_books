But in the twelve years before 1764, including that year, the average price of the best wheat at the same market was £2:1:9½d. 

So, in the first twelve years of the last century, wheat was a lot cheaper, and butcher’s meat was a lot more expensive than in the twelve years before 1764, including that year. 

In big countries, most of the farmland is used to grow food for people or food for animals. The money made from renting and selling this food affects how much money can be made from other types of farmland. If a certain crop doesn’t make much money, farmers will switch to growing corn or raising animals. But if a crop makes more money, some farmland used for corn or animals will be changed to grow that crop. 

Crops that need more money to start or more care to grow usually bring in more rent or profit than corn or pasture. However, this extra money is usually just enough to cover the higher costs. 

In a hop garden, fruit garden, or vegetable garden, both the landlord’s rent and the farmer’s profit are usually higher than in a corn or grass field. But getting the land ready for these gardens costs more money. So, the landlord gets more rent. It also needs more careful and skilled work, which means the farmer makes more profit. 

However, the crops in hop and fruit gardens can be less reliable. Their prices need to cover any losses and also provide some profit for insurance. Gardeners often don’t make a lot of money because many wealthy people do gardening for fun, so they don’t buy from those who do it for profit. 

The money the landlord makes from these improvements usually just covers the original costs of making them. In ancient farming, after vineyards, a well-watered kitchen garden was thought to be the most valuable part of a farm. But Democritus, who wrote about farming around two thousand years ago and was seen as one of the early experts, believed...
