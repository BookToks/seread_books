Adam Smith

The invention of machines that make work easier is mostly because of dividing tasks. When people focus on one specific job, they can find better and faster ways to do it. If everyone is working on different things, it’s harder to come up with new ideas. But when tasks are divided, each person can concentrate on one simple job. This means that someone in each job area will likely discover easier ways to do their work whenever possible.

Many machines used in industries where tasks are divided were created by regular workers. These workers, doing simple tasks, often think of ways to make their jobs easier. If you’ve seen factories, you might have noticed cool machines invented by workers to help them with their specific tasks. 

For example, in the early steam engines, a boy had to open and close a valve while the machine worked. He realized that if he tied a string to the valve, it could open and close on its own. This way, he could play with his friends instead of working. This simple idea from a boy helped improve the machine a lot.

However, not all machine improvements come from the people using them. Many upgrades are made by the people who build the machines, especially when making machines becomes a special job. Some improvements come from thinkers or philosophers, who don’t make things but observe and come up with ideas. They can connect different ideas and objects in society. Just like any other job, philosophy has many different areas, each providing work for different people.
