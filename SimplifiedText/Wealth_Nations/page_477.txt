The Wealth of Nations

Some things are made for convenience, some for fun, and some just to look nice. All of these things help people enjoy life more.

The discovery and colonization of America have helped increase the work and businesses in countries that trade with it directly, like Spain, Portugal, France, and England. It has also helped countries that don’t trade directly but send their goods through other countries, like Austria and parts of Germany. These countries send things like linen and other products to America. Because of this, they have more places to sell their extra goods, which encourages them to make even more.

It’s not as obvious, but countries like Hungary and Poland, which might not have sent anything to America, have also benefited. Some products from America, like sugar, chocolate, and tobacco, are consumed in Hungary and Poland. To buy these products, they need to use something they produce or something they got from selling their own goods. These American products create new opportunities for trade in Hungary and Poland, giving them a bigger market for their extra goods. This can raise the value of what they produce and encourage them to make more.

Even countries that never sent anything to America or received anything from it might have benefited. They might get more goods from countries that do trade with America. This means they have more stuff to enjoy, which can also help them work harder and produce more. With more goods available for trade, it creates a bigger market for what they make, increasing its value.
