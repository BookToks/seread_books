The Wealth of Nations

Banks need to make sure that the money coming in is at least as much as the money going out. If a bank keeps giving loans to customers who don’t pay back enough, it can’t keep lending safely. If more money is going out than coming in, the bank will run out of money quickly unless they find a way to get more funds.

In Scotland, banks were careful to ask for regular payments from their customers. They wouldn’t lend money to anyone who didn’t make these payments regularly. This helped them avoid extra costs to refill their funds and gave them two big benefits.

First, by keeping track of payments, banks could tell if their borrowers were doing well or struggling. Most people either pay back their loans on time or they don’t, depending on how well they’re doing financially. A person who lends money to a few friends can easily check on how they’re doing. But a bank that lends to hundreds of people can’t keep track of everyone’s situation without looking at their records. By asking for regular payments, Scottish banks could get a better idea of their customers' financial health.

Second, this practice helped banks avoid printing too much paper money that the economy couldn’t handle. When they saw that a customer was paying back loans regularly, they knew they were managing their money well.
