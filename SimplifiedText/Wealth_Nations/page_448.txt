The rich and powerful people didn’t want to share their wealth. To make them happy, they often suggested starting a new colony. But Rome didn’t need to send its citizens out into the world to find new places to live. Instead, they usually gave them land in the areas they had already conquered in Italy. This way, the citizens stayed under Roman control and couldn’t create their own independent state. They were more like a group that could make their own rules, but they still had to follow the laws of Rome.

Starting a colony like this not only made some people happy but also helped keep control in new areas that might have been hard to manage. Roman colonies were very different from Greek ones. The Latin word for colony means a simple settlement, while the Greek word means leaving home or moving away. Even though Roman and Greek colonies were different, the reasons for starting them were pretty clear. Both were created out of strong need or clear benefits.

The European colonies in America and the West Indies didn’t come from a real need. While they ended up being very useful, it wasn’t obvious at first. People didn’t really understand why they were being established or what benefits they would bring, and even today, the full impact of those colonies isn’t completely clear.

During the 14th and 15th centuries, the Venetians made a lot of money trading spices and other goods from the East Indies. They mainly bought these goods in Egypt, which was controlled by the Mamelukes, who were enemies of the Turks. Since the Venetians were also against the Turks, this situation helped them gain almost complete control over the trade.

The huge profits the Venetians made caught the attention of the Portuguese. Throughout the 15th century, the Portuguese were trying to find a sea route to the countries where the Moors brought ivory and gold dust across the desert.
