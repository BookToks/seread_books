Every town gets everything it needs, like food and materials, from the surrounding countryside. It pays for these things in two main ways. First, it sends back some of those materials after turning them into finished products. This makes the prices go up because of the workers' wages and the profits of their bosses. Second, it also imports goods from other places, which also raises prices because of the wages of the people who transport them and the profits of the merchants.

The money made from the first way is what helps the town grow through its own manufacturing. The money from the second way comes from trade with other areas. The wages of workers and the profits of their employers add up to what the town earns from both types of trade. If there are rules that help raise those wages and profits, the town can buy more from the countryside with less effort. This gives people in the town an advantage over farmers and workers in the countryside, upsetting the natural balance of trade between them.

Every year, the work done by everyone in society is split between people in the town and those in the countryside. Thanks to these rules, townspeople get a bigger share than they would normally get, while country folks get less. 

The real cost for the town when it buys food and materials is how much it sells its own goods for. If the town sells its products for a higher price, it can buy the things it needs for a lower price.
