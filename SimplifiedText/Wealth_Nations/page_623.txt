The Wealth of Nations

Teachers should not be able to switch students around without asking first. If they could, it would make them less motivated to do a good job and care about their students. Even if they get paid well, they might not pay attention to their students, just like teachers who don’t get paid at all.

If a teacher is smart, it must be really frustrating for him to realize that he’s either talking nonsense or something that isn’t much better. It’s also tough for him to see that most of his students skip his lectures or show that they don’t care. If he has to give a certain number of lectures, he might actually try to make them decent just because of these reasons. 

However, there are ways for teachers to avoid putting in real effort. Instead of explaining things himself, a teacher might just read from a book. If the book is in a hard language, he could just have the students translate it for him or make a few comments here and there. This way, he can pretend he’s teaching without really doing much. As long as he knows a little bit about the subject, he can avoid looking foolish. Plus, the college rules can make sure students have to attend his lectures and act respectfully, even if they aren’t really learning anything.

College rules are usually made for the teachers’ benefit, not the students’. They are meant to keep the teachers in charge and make students act like the teachers are doing a great job, even if they aren’t. It seems to assume that teachers are always wise and good, while students are weak and foolish. But when teachers actually do their jobs well, students usually don’t skip out on their responsibilities. No one needs to force students to attend good lectures, as everyone knows they will show up for those.
