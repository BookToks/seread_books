The Wealth of Nations

In France, the clergy used to depend a lot on the pope in Rome, but that changed because of some important agreements. Back in the early days of the monarchy, French clergy were just as loyal to the pope as those in other countries. For example, when a king named Robert was unfairly kicked out of the church, his servants wouldn’t eat any food that had been touched by him. They learned to do this from their own church leaders.

Over time, the church's power to control important church jobs was challenged, and this happened even before the Reformation. As the church had less influence over the people, the government gained more power over the church. Because of this, the clergy had less power and didn’t want to cause trouble for the government.

By the time the Reformation started in Germany, the church in Rome was losing its authority. New ideas were becoming popular everywhere. People were excited about these new beliefs and were eager to spread them, especially since they were challenging the old ways. The teachers of these new ideas, while not necessarily smarter than the church leaders, knew more about church history and how the church got its power. This gave them an edge in arguments. Their strict lifestyles made them respected by regular folks, who compared them to the often messy lives of many church leaders. 

These new teachers were also better at winning people over and gaining followers, skills that the traditional church leaders had ignored. Some liked the new ideas because they made sense, others because they were different, and many because they disliked the established clergy. But what really drew in the most people was the passionate and sometimes rough way these new ideas were shared. The new beliefs became very popular almost everywhere.
