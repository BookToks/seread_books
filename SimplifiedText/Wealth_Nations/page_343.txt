The Wealth of Nations

When a country buys foreign goods, it doesn’t always keep them. Sometimes, those goods are sold to other countries for a big profit, bringing back more money than what was spent to buy them. Mr. Mun compares this to farming. He says, “If we only look at a farmer planting seeds, we might think he’s crazy for wasting good corn. But when we see the harvest, we understand how valuable his work was.”

They also pointed out that stopping the export of gold and silver wouldn’t really work. Because gold and silver are small but valuable, they can be smuggled out easily. To really control this, a country needs to pay attention to what they call the balance of trade. If a country sells more than it buys, it gets money back from other countries in gold and silver, which increases its amount of those metals. But if it buys more than it sells, it owes money to other countries, which means it loses gold and silver. Trying to stop the export of these metals wouldn’t work; it would just make it riskier and more expensive. 

If the exchange rate is bad for a country, it means they owe more money. For example, if the exchange rate between England and Holland is 5% against England, it would take 105 ounces of silver in England to buy a bill for 100 ounces of silver in Holland. This means that 105 ounces in England is worth less than 100 ounces in Holland. So, when selling goods, English products would be cheaper in Holland, while Dutch goods would be more expensive in England because of this difference.
