The cost of managing customs is about five to six percent of the total money made from them. After paying out rewards and refunds, it goes up to more than ten percent on what’s left.

Since there are high taxes on almost all imported goods, merchants try to smuggle in as much as they can and declare as little as possible. On the other hand, exporters often declare more than they actually send out. Sometimes they do this to look important or to get money back on goods that don’t have taxes. Because of these tricks, it looks like we export way more than we import, which makes some politicians happy because they think it shows the country is doing well.

Most imported goods have to pay some kind of tax unless they are specifically listed as exempt, and there aren’t many exemptions. If something is imported that isn’t listed, it gets taxed at about 4s:9¾d for every twenty shillings of value, based on what the importer says. The tax list is really long and includes a lot of items that aren’t commonly used, so it can be confusing to figure out which category a specific item belongs to and how much tax it should pay. This can cause big problems for customs officers and a lot of hassle and extra costs for importers. Overall, customs taxes are less clear and straightforward than excise taxes.

To make sure most people in society pay their fair share of taxes based on what they spend, it’s not necessary to tax every single item. Excise taxes are thought to be fair because they apply to just a few commonly used items. Many believe that customs taxes could also be simplified to focus on just a few key items without hurting the government’s income and actually helping trade with other countries. 

The main foreign goods that people in Great Britain use a lot right now include wines and brandies, some products from America and the West Indies like sugar, rum, tobacco, and coconuts, as well as items from the East Indies like tea, coffee, china, and various spices. These items provide a lot of revenue.
