The Wealth of Nations

Transporting goods to faraway places usually costs a lot of money. So, while the price of wool might not go up as much as meat, it should still go up a bit and definitely shouldn’t go down.

In England, even though the wool industry is doing well, the price of English wool has dropped a lot since the time of King Edward III. Records show that around the middle of the 14th century, the average price for a tod (which is 28 pounds of wool) was about ten shillings. If we compare that to today’s money, that would be around thirty shillings. Nowadays, a good price for high-quality English wool is about twenty-one shillings for a tod. So, back in Edward III’s time, the price of wool was about ten shillings, while today it’s about seven shillings. 

Also, back then, ten shillings could buy twelve bushels of wheat. Today, twenty-one shillings only buys six bushels. This means that in the past, a tod of wool could buy twice as much food as it can now. If the value of work was the same back then and now, it would mean that wool could buy twice the amount of labor too.

The drop in the value of wool didn’t happen naturally. It was caused by some unfair rules. First, England banned exporting wool. Then, they allowed wool to be imported from Spain without taxes. They also stopped Ireland from exporting wool anywhere but England. Because of these rules, the market for English wool shrank instead of growing, and now it has to compete with wool from other countries, including Ireland. Since the Irish wool industry is also limited, they can’t use all their wool at home and have to send more of it to Great Britain, which is the only market they can sell to.
