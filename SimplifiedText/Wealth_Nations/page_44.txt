In the early days when people didnâ€™t have much money or land, the amount of work needed to get different things was the main way to trade them. For example, if it takes twice as much effort to catch a beaver as it does to catch a deer, then one beaver should be worth two deer. It makes sense that what takes two days or two hours of work should be worth double what takes one day or one hour.

If one type of work is harder than another, people will usually consider that and might trade one hour of hard work for two hours of easier work. Also, if a job needs special skills or talent, people will value that work more, even if it takes less time. These skills often take a long time to learn, and the extra value is just a fair way to pay for the time and effort spent learning them. In more developed societies, people often get paid more for harder or skilled work, and this likely happened even in the earliest days.

In those times, all the work done belonged to the workers, and the amount of work needed to make or get something was the main factor in deciding how much work it should cost or be traded for. 

Once some people started saving up money, they would hire workers, giving them materials and food so they could make things and earn a profit from selling their work. When they sold the finished products, they would need to cover the cost of materials and pay the workers, but they would also keep some money for themselves as profit.
