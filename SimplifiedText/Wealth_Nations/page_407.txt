The Wealth of Nations talks about how much corn is exported compared to what is eaten at home. For every 5 shillings people pay in the first tax, they end up paying £6:4s in the second tax. This heavy tax on corn, which is a basic need, can either make it harder for poor workers to afford food or force their wages to go up to match the higher prices. If it makes it harder for workers to buy food, they might struggle to take care of their kids, which could lead to fewer people being born. If wages go up, employers might not be able to hire as many workers, which could hurt the economy.

The large amount of corn being exported because of the bounty (a type of financial support) means that while it helps sell more corn abroad, it also takes away from what’s available at home. This can slow down the growth of the local market for corn. In the long run, it might actually reduce how much corn is sold overall.

Some people think that because the price of corn goes up, farmers will want to grow more of it. But that’s not really true. The bounty might make the price look higher, but it doesn’t help farmers in a real way. It doesn’t let them feed more workers with the same amount of corn. The bounty mainly affects the price of corn on paper, not its true value. 

In reality, the bounty makes the value of money go down, meaning you can buy less with the same amount of money. The price of corn sets the price for everything else made at home, including labor costs. Workers need to earn enough to buy enough corn to feed themselves and their families, depending on how well the economy is doing.
