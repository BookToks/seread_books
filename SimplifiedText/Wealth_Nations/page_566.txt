If a country goes to war, not everyone can fight. The old people, women, and kids have to stay home to take care of things. But most of the young men can go and often do, especially in smaller countries. Usually, about one out of every four or five people is of military age. If a war starts after planting crops and ends before harvest, farmers can leave without losing too much money. They believe that the old people, women, and kids can handle the work while they are away. Because of this, many are willing to fight for free during a short war. 

In ancient Greece, people from different states fought like this until after the second Persian war. The people from Peloponnesus did the same until after the Peloponnesian war. Thucydides noted that they often left to go home and harvest in the summer. The Romans also fought this way during the early days of their republic. It wasn’t until the siege of Veii that those who stayed home started helping pay for those who went to fight. 

In the European kingdoms that came after the Roman Empire, the big lords and their followers used to serve the king at their own cost. They took care of themselves in battle just like they did at home, without getting paid by the king. 

As society got more advanced, it became impossible for soldiers to support themselves while fighting. This was because of two main reasons: the growth of factories and the way war was fought changed. 

If a farmer goes to war after planting and before harvest, he might not lose much money since nature helps with the crops. But if a craftsman, like a blacksmith or carpenter, leaves his workshop, he loses all his income because he relies on his own work. So when he goes to fight for the public, he doesn’t have any money coming in to support himself.
