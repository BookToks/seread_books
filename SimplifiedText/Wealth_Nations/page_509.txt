The Wealth of Nations

In a country, the way a London merchant uses their money can be different. This way might make the merchant more money than other jobs, but because it takes a long time to see profits, it’s not really better for the country.

After all the unfair efforts by European countries to take all the benefits from their colonies, no country has really managed to keep all the good stuff for itself. Instead, they end up with the costs of keeping control over these colonies during peace and war. Every country has taken on the problems that come with having colonies, but they have to share the benefits of trade with others.

At first, it seems like having control over American trade is super valuable. To those who don’t think deeply, it looks like a shiny prize worth fighting for in the messy world of politics and war. However, that shiny prize, which is the huge trade, is also what makes having control over it harmful. It makes one job less beneficial for the country than many other jobs, and it uses up more money than it should.

Every country’s trade money naturally looks for the best way to help that country. If it’s used for shipping goods, that country becomes the main place for all the goods from other countries. But the owner of that money wants to sell as many of those goods as possible at home. This way, they avoid the hassle, risk, and cost of sending them abroad. Because of this, they are happy to sell them at home for a lower price and with a smaller profit than they could get by exporting them. So, they try to turn their shipping trade into selling to other countries.

If their money is used to sell goods to other countries, they will also want to sell as much as they can of the local goods they collect to send abroad. They will try to turn their foreign trade into local trade. This is how every country’s trade money naturally prefers local jobs over distant ones.
