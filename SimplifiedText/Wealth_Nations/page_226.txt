First, there are useful machines and tools that make work easier and faster.

Second, there are buildings that help make money, not just for the owner who rents them out, but also for the person who pays to use them. This includes shops, warehouses, and places where people work, like farms and their extra buildings, such as stables and storage areas. These buildings are different from regular homes because they help with business.

Third, there are improvements made to land, like clearing it, draining water, and making it ready for farming. A better farm is like a useful machine that helps make more money for the farmer. An improved farm is just as helpful and lasts longer than machines, often needing only smart use of the farmer's money to keep it going.

Fourth, there are the skills and talents of people in the community. Learning these skills costs money while someone is being educated or trained. These skills are part of a person's wealth and also benefit the whole community. A worker's improved skills can be seen as a tool that makes work easier and, even though it costs money to learn, it can bring back more money in the long run.

The last part of the community's wealth is called circulating capital, which makes money by changing hands. It has four parts. 

First, there's money that helps move everything around and gets it to the right people.

Second, there are supplies of food owned by butchers, farmers, and others who hope to sell them for a profit.

Third, there are materials for making clothes, furniture, and buildings that are not yet finished. These materials are still with the people who grow or make them, like farmers, manufacturers, and builders.
