The Wealth of Nations talks about what people need to live. Back in the days of the Greeks and Romans, they lived well without things like linen shirts. But today, in most of Europe, a decent worker would feel embarrassed to go out without a linen shirt. Not having one is seen as a sign of being really poor, which people think only happens if you do something wrong.

Similarly, in England, leather shoes are seen as something everyone needs. Even the poorest people would feel ashamed to be seen without them. In Scotland, even the lowest men are expected to wear shoes, but women can walk around barefoot without any shame. In France, neither men nor women need shoes to be accepted in public; they can wear wooden shoes or go barefoot without it being a big deal.

When I talk about what people need, I mean not just what nature requires but also what society thinks is necessary for people to fit in. Everything else is what I call luxuries. For example, drinks like beer and wine are luxuries. Anyone can choose not to drink them without being judged because they aren’t needed to survive.

Wages for work are set based on how much people want to hire workers and the average cost of necessary items. If the price of these necessary items goes up, wages have to go up too, so workers can still buy what they need. If there’s a tax on these items, it makes their price go up even more than the tax amount because sellers want to make a profit. This means wages will rise to match the higher prices.

So, a tax on things people need works like a tax directly on workers' wages. Even if workers pay this tax themselves, they don’t really pay it out of their own money for long. Their employers will cover it by raising wages. If the employer is a manufacturer, they will increase the price of their products to include the higher wages and make a profit, so in the end, the tax gets paid through higher prices.
