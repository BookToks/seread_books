The Wealth of Nations

The way people get paid for their work is important because it shows how much money a country is making. If workers are paid very little, it means the country isn’t doing well, and if they are starving, things are getting worse.

In Great Britain today, workers seem to earn more money than they need to support a family. We don’t need to do complicated math to figure this out. There are clear signs that workers' pay isn’t based on the lowest amount needed to live decently.

First, in many parts of Great Britain, there’s a difference in pay between summer and winter. Workers usually earn more in the summer. But winter is when it costs more to take care of a family because of heating bills. So, workers get paid more when it’s cheaper to live, which shows that their pay is based on how much work they do, not just what they need to survive. Some might say that workers should save their summer pay for winter, but that’s not how we treat someone who is completely dependent on us for food. They would get what they need every day.

Second, in Great Britain, workers’ pay doesn’t change with the price of food. Food prices can go up and down a lot, sometimes even every month. But in many areas, the pay for workers stays the same for a long time, sometimes decades. If workers can feed their families when food is expensive, they must be doing well when food is cheap. In the last ten years, even though food prices went up, many workers didn’t see a big increase in their pay. When pay did go up, it was likely because there were more jobs available, not just because food got more expensive.

Third, food prices change more from year to year than workers’ pay does. On the other hand, workers’ pay can be very different from one place to another, while food prices are usually pretty similar across the country. The prices of bread and meat are often about the same in most parts of Great Britain.
