Adam Smith talks about how only the strongest countries can handle really high taxes and still do well. Holland is a good example of this. People often think that Holland does well because of these taxes, but it's actually the opposite; they succeed despite them.

There are times when it makes sense to tax foreign goods to help local businesses. But there are also times when we need to think about whether we should keep letting certain foreign products in or how to bring them back after stopping them for a while. 

One situation to think about is when another country makes it hard for us to sell our products there by charging high taxes or banning them. In this case, it’s natural to want to get back at them by doing the same to their products. Countries usually respond this way. 

For example, the French have often tried to protect their own products by limiting foreign goods that compete with them. This was a big part of the strategy of a guy named Mr. Colbert. Even though he was smart, he was tricked by merchants who wanted to keep competition away from their businesses. Nowadays, many smart people in France believe that his actions didn’t actually help the country. 

In 1667, Colbert set high taxes on many foreign products. When he wouldn’t lower these taxes for the Dutch, they stopped importing French wines and goods in 1671. This trade argument partly led to a war in 1672. The peace agreement in 1678 helped calm things down by lowering some taxes for the Dutch, who then lifted their ban on French goods. Around the same time, the French and English started to hurt each other's businesses with similar taxes, with the French starting it first. The bad feelings between the two countries have made it hard for them to ease up on each other since then.

In 1697, the English banned the import of bone lace, which was a type of lace made from threads.
