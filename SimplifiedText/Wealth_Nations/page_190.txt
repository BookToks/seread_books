Poultry is not really seen as a big deal in England, but it’s definitely more expensive there than in France because England gets a lot of its poultry from France. When farmers start growing food for animals, the prices for that food go up before it gets cheaper. At first, when there’s not enough food, prices go up. But once farming becomes common, farmers find better ways to feed animals, which helps them produce more food on the same amount of land. When there’s more food available, prices drop because farmers can afford to sell it for less. This is probably why the prices of meat in London have gone down since the early 1900s.

Hogs eat things that other animals won’t touch, and they were originally kept to use up leftovers. As long as there are enough hogs raised cheaply, pork stays cheaper than other meats. But if more people want pork than there are hogs available, farmers have to grow food just for them, which makes prices go up. The price of pork can be higher or lower depending on how easy or hard it is to raise hogs compared to other animals. In France, pork costs about the same as beef, but in most of Great Britain, it’s a bit more expensive right now.

The rising prices of hogs and poultry in Great Britain are often blamed on fewer small farmers and cottagers. This change usually leads to better farming practices, but it also makes prices go up faster than they would have otherwise. Just like a poor family can keep a cat or dog without spending much, small farmers can usually keep a few chickens or pigs for very little money. They can feed them scraps from their meals or leftover dairy products.
