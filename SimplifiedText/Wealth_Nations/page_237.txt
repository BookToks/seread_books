The Wealth of Nations

In the country, there’s a lot of money that can’t be used here, but it’s too important to just sit around. So, it gets sent to other countries where it can be used better. However, paper money can’t be used in other countries because people won’t accept it far away from the banks that made it. So, they send out eight hundred thousand pounds in gold and silver, while keeping a million in paper money at home.

Even though a lot of gold and silver is sent away, it’s not just given away for free. The people who own it will trade it for goods from other countries to either sell or use back home. If they buy things from one country to sell in another, any profit they make adds to their country’s income. It’s like creating a new way to do business; local sales happen with paper money, while gold and silver are used for this new trade.

If they buy foreign goods to use at home, they might choose to get things that lazy people consume, like fancy wines or silks. Or, they could buy materials and tools to help more hardworking people create products that can be sold for a profit. 

When they spend money on luxury items, it encourages wastefulness and raises costs without actually making anything new, which is bad for society. But if they invest in tools and materials, it boosts productivity. Even though it increases what people consume, it also ensures that there’s enough to support that consumption because those who consume will create enough value to cover it. 

The total income of society grows because of the value added by workers using those materials, and the net income is what’s left after paying for the tools they need. Most of the gold and silver that gets sent abroad is used to buy goods.
