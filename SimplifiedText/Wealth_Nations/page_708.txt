Adam Smith says that when someone sells something, like an old house, they usually have to pay taxes on it. This is similar to selling land. Most of the time, the seller has to sell because they need to or it's just easier for them. 

The number of new houses built each year depends on how many people want to buy them. If builders can't make a profit after paying for everything, they won't build more houses. On the other hand, the number of old houses for sale can change due to random events, like a few big businesses going bankrupt, which can force many houses to be sold quickly, often for less than they're worth.

Taxes on ground rents also fall on the seller, just like taxes on land sales. When people borrow money, they pay taxes on the contracts and agreements, and these costs always end up being paid by the borrower. Similarly, taxes related to legal matters affect the people involved in those cases. If it costs more to buy property, then its value goes down.

All taxes on transferring property can lower its value, which means there’s less money available to support jobs that actually produce things. These taxes often help the government make money, but they usually don’t help the people who work hard. 

Even when taxes are based on how much a property is worth, they can still be unfair because not all properties are sold at the same rate. When taxes aren't based on value, like many stamp duties, they can be even more unfair. These taxes are clear and straightforward, but they can hit people who might not have enough money to pay. However, the timing of when these taxes are due usually gives people enough time to prepare.

In France, people don’t complain much about stamp duties, but they do about registration taxes, which they call the Controle. These taxes can lead to unfair treatment by the tax collectors, making the process feel random and uncertain.
