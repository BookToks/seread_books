Adam Smith talks about how taxes on workers' wages affect their pay. If the demand for jobs and the cost of food stay the same, a tax on wages will just make wages go up a bit more than the tax itself.

For example, let’s say workers usually earn ten shillings a week. If there’s a tax of four shillings, the workers still need to take home ten shillings after paying the tax. To do this, their wages would need to rise to twelve and sixpence a week. So, instead of just going up by four shillings, their pay would need to go up by six shillings. This means that no matter how much the tax is, wages will go up by more than just the tax amount.

Even if workers pay the tax directly, it’s not really their responsibility if the job demand and food prices don’t change. The employer who hires them ends up covering the tax and then some. For example, if a factory owner has to pay workers more because of the tax, they will raise the prices of their products to make up for it. So, in the end, the customers will pay for the higher wages.

In farming, if a farmer has to pay workers more, they will need to spend more money to keep the same number of workers. To recover that extra cost, the farmer might keep more of the crops they grow and pay less rent to the landlord. So, in this case, the landlord ends up losing out because the farmer has to pay less rent due to the tax.

Overall, when there’s a tax on workers’ wages, it doesn’t just affect the workers; it impacts everyone involved in the process, from employers to consumers to landlords.
