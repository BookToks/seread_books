The Wealth of Nations

People are always trying to find the best way to use their money. They mainly think about what benefits them, but in doing so, they often end up helping society too.

First, everyone wants to use their money close to home. They prefer to support local businesses as long as they can still make a decent profit. 

So, when profits are about the same, a merchant will usually choose to sell locally instead of internationally. Selling locally means they can keep a closer eye on their money and know the people they’re dealing with better. If something goes wrong, they understand the local laws better, which makes it easier to fix problems.

In international trade, a merchant's money is split between two countries, and they can’t always keep track of it. For example, if a merchant in Amsterdam is shipping grain from one place to another, half of their money might be in one country and the other half in another. This means they might never see some of their money again. 

Because of this worry about being so far from their money, merchants often decide to bring some of their goods back to Amsterdam. Even though this means they have to pay extra fees for loading and unloading, they do it so they can keep part of their money close. This is why countries that have a lot of shipping trade become major markets for goods from different places. Merchants try to sell as much as they can locally to avoid those extra costs.
