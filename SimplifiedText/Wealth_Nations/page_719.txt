The Wealth of Nations

Raising the price of important things like food can cause a lot of problems. Instead of making money for the government, it often leads to big expenses. High taxes on foreign corn can make it almost impossible to import, especially during good harvest years. Right now, there’s a ban on bringing in live animals or preserved food, but this is temporarily lifted for Ireland and British colonies due to shortages. These rules act like taxes on essential items and don’t help the government earn money. To change these rules, people just need to see that they don’t work.

In many countries, taxes on basic needs are even higher than in Great Britain. For example, taxes on flour and bread can double the price in places like Holland. People in the countryside pay a yearly fee based on the type of bread they eat. If someone eats wheat bread, they pay about six shillings and ninepence. These taxes also make it more expensive to hire workers, which has hurt many businesses in Holland. Similar taxes, though not as heavy, exist in places like Milan and Genoa. A French writer suggested fixing his country’s money problems by replacing many taxes with these harmful ones. Cicero once said that some philosophers have claimed really silly things.

Taxes on meat are even more common than those on bread. Some people wonder if meat is really necessary for life. You can have a healthy and filling diet with grains, vegetables, milk, cheese, and butter or oil instead of meat. No one really needs to eat meat to be decent, unlike how people need to wear shirts or shoes. 

Goods, whether they are necessities or luxuries, can be taxed in two ways. A consumer might pay a yearly fee based on what they use or consume.
