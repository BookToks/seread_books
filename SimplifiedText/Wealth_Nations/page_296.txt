Adam Smith says that rent is what a landlord gets for letting a farmer use the land. The amount of rent depends on how good the land is. It’s basically what nature provides after taking away what people have done. Rent is usually at least a quarter of what the land produces, and often more than a third. 

When it comes to making things in factories, nature doesn’t help much; it’s all about what people do. So, the amount produced in factories is always linked to how hard people work. In farming, the money spent not only gets more work done than in factories but also creates more value for the country’s wealth and what people earn. Farming is the best way to use money for society.

Money used in farming and local shops usually stays in that community. It’s mostly tied to specific places, like farms and stores. On the other hand, a big merchant can move their money around to find the best deals, whether buying cheap or selling high.

Manufacturers have to keep their money where they make things, but that location can change. For example, a city like Lyons is far from where the materials come from and where the finished products are sold. People in Sicily wear silk made from materials grown elsewhere. Some wool from Spain is made into cloth in Great Britain, and then some of that cloth goes back to Spain.

It doesn’t really matter if the merchant selling extra products is from the same country or not. If they are foreign, the number of local workers is only one less than if they were local, and the country loses the profit from that one person. The workers they hire, like sailors or carriers, can be from either their country or the local area.
