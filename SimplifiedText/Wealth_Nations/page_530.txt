Adam Smith talks about how when the price of wool or animal hides goes down too much, it can actually make the price of meat go up in a country that is doing well. 

The price of cows and sheep that are raised on good land needs to be high enough to cover what the landlord wants for rent and what the farmer expects to earn. If the price is too low, farmers will stop raising them. So, if wool and hides don’t sell for enough, the price of the meat has to go up to make up for it. 

Landlords and farmers don’t really care how the price is split between wool and meat, as long as they get paid. In a good country, rules that lower wool prices won’t really hurt landlords and farmers much, but it might affect consumers because food prices could go up. 

Even if lower wool prices don’t change how much wool is produced, they might affect the quality of the wool. If the quality of English wool has dropped, it might be because the price has dropped too. The quality of wool depends on the sheep's breed, their food, and how well they are taken care of. If the price is low, farmers might not put in as much effort to take care of the sheep. 

However, the quality of wool is also linked to how healthy and big the sheep are. Taking care of the sheep for better meat can also help improve the wool. Despite the lower prices, people say that English wool has actually gotten better in recent years. It might have improved even more if the prices were higher, but the low prices didn’t stop the improvement completely.
