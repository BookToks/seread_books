The industry in towns is generally better than in the countryside. We can see this easily. In every European country, there are many people who became rich through trade and manufacturing, which are town jobs. In comparison, there are very few who got rich from farming and working the land. This shows that jobs in towns pay better, and people naturally want to work where they can earn more money. So, they move to towns and leave the countryside.

In towns, people are close together, making it easier for them to work together. Even small businesses in towns often form groups or associations. They might not be officially organized, but they still work together to protect their interests. This can lead to them keeping their trade secrets and not wanting to train new workers. For example, a few wool-combers can control the work of many spinners and weavers. By agreeing not to take on apprentices, they can dominate the job market and raise their prices unfairly.

On the other hand, people in the countryside live far apart, making it hard for them to join forces. They don’t have the same spirit of working together like in towns. Farming, which is the main job in the country, doesn’t require an apprenticeship like other trades do. However, farming needs a lot of knowledge and experience. Many books have been written about it, showing that it’s not as simple as some might think. Even the average farmer has a lot of understanding about farming that is hard to explain in just a few words.
