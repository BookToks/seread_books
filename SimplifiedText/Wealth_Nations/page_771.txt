The Wealth of Nations

Raising the value of coins is something that everyone knows about. When this happens, coins that are lighter and smaller are called the same name as heavier and bigger coins. But changing the quality of the coins is usually done secretly. With this method, new coins are made that look and weigh almost the same as older coins that were worth more. For example, when King John of France needed money, he secretly made his coins less valuable, and everyone involved had to keep it a secret. 

Both actions are unfair. However, raising the value of coins is a clear act of theft, while changing the quality of coins is sneaky and dishonest. When people find out about the sneaky changes, they get much angrier than when the value is raised. After a significant value increase, coins rarely go back to their original weight. But after major changes in quality, they usually return to their original value because people are very upset about it.

At the end of King Henry VIII's reign and the start of King Edward VI's, the value of English coins was raised, and their quality was also lowered. Similar tricks happened in Scotland when James VI was young, and these kinds of fraud have happened in many other countries too.

Great Britain’s government can’t really get rid of its debt or make much progress toward that goal because its extra money is very small. To fix this, there needs to be either a big increase in government income or a big cut in government spending.

A fairer land tax, a fairer tax on house rent, and changes to the current customs and excise taxes could help raise more money without putting extra pressure on most people. However, even the most hopeful person would find it hard to believe that any of these changes would completely solve the government’s money problems.
