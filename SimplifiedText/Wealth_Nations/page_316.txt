Adam Smith talks about how some farmers, called metayers, work on land owned by landlords. These farmers get to keep part of what they grow, but they can’t invest their own money to make the land better. This is because the landlord takes half of whatever the land produces, which makes it hard for the farmers to improve things. 

In France, most of the land is still farmed by metayers. Landowners complain that these farmers prefer to use the landlord's animals for moving things instead of farming, since they keep all the profits from moving but have to share the farming profits. In Scotland, there are similar farmers known as steel-bow tenants. In the past, some English farmers were more like helpers for the landlords than actual farmers.

Over time, real farmers started to appear. These farmers used their own resources to farm the land and paid a set rent to the landlord. If they had a lease for a few years, they might spend some of their money to improve the farm because they could make a profit before the lease ended. However, even these farmers faced a lot of uncertainty. A new buyer could kick them off the land before their lease was up. 

In England, if a farmer was kicked off unfairly, the way to get help was not very good. They might get some money for their troubles, but it didn’t always help them get their land back. It wasn’t until around the 14th year of King Henry VII's reign that a better legal process was created. This new process allowed tenants to not only get money but also their land back, making it a much stronger way to protect their rights.
