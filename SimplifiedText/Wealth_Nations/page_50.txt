In every community, there’s a usual or average amount of money people earn and make from different jobs and businesses. This average is influenced by how rich or poor the community is, whether it’s growing, staying the same, or getting worse, and also by the specific type of job.

There’s also a typical amount of rent people pay for land, which is affected by the overall situation of the community and how good or bad the land is for farming.

These average amounts can be called the natural rates of wages, profits, and rent for that time and place.

When the price of something is just enough to cover the rent of the land, the wages for the workers, and the profits for the business, it’s sold at what we can call its natural price. This means it’s sold for what it’s really worth or what it costs to bring it to market. Even though people usually don’t think about the seller’s profit when they talk about the cost of an item, if the seller doesn’t make the usual profit for their area, they’re actually losing money. They could have made that profit by doing something else with their resources. 

The seller’s profit is also their income, which they need to live on. While they’re getting the goods ready to sell, they pay their workers and also pay themselves a salary that matches the profit they expect to make. If the goods don’t make that profit, they aren’t really worth what they cost the seller.

So, the price that allows the seller to make a profit isn’t always the lowest price they can sell for, but it’s the lowest price they can sell at for a long time, especially if they can easily switch to a different job.

The actual price that people usually pay for something is called its market price. This price can be higher, lower, or exactly the same as the natural price.
