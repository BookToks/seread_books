In their setup, the arts like philosophy, poetry, and speaking skills were developed just as much, if not more, than in the main country. It's interesting that the schools of the two oldest Greek philosophers, Thales and Pythagoras, were not in ancient Greece but in one Asian and one Italian colony. These colonies were in places where wild and uncivilized people lived, who easily made room for the new settlers. They had a lot of good land, and since they were independent from the main city, they could run their own affairs the way they thought was best for them.

The story of the Roman colonies isn't as impressive. Some, like Florence, became important states over many years after the main city fell. But none of them grew very quickly. They were set up in conquered areas that were already populated. The amount of land each colonist got was usually small, and since the colony wasn't independent, they couldn't always manage their own affairs the way they wanted.

The European colonies in America and the West Indies had plenty of good land, even more than those in ancient Greece. They were dependent on their main country like the Roman colonies, but being far from Europe helped lessen this dependency. Their distance made them less visible and less controlled by their main country. Sometimes, their actions went unnoticed or misunderstood in Europe, and other times, they were allowed to do their own thing because it was hard to stop them from so far away. Even Spain, with its strict government, had to change or soften its rules for its colonies to avoid a big uprising. Because of this, all the European colonies grew a lot in wealth, population, and development.

From the start, Spain made money from its colonies through gold and silver. This created huge expectations for even more riches. So, the Spanish colonies caught a lot of attention from their main country right away, while the colonies of other European nations were not as focused on.
