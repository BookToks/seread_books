There are three main groups of people who help produce goods from the land and labor in a country. 

The first group is landowners. The second group is farmers and workers in the fields, who are called the productive class because they actually grow food and raise animals. The third group includes people like craftsmen, factory workers, and shopkeepers, who some people unfairly call the unproductive class.

Landowners help produce goods by spending money to improve the land. They might build things like houses, fences, or drainage systems. These improvements help farmers grow more crops, which means they can pay higher rent to the landowners. The extra rent is like the profit the landowners make from their investments in the land.

Farmers also contribute by spending money on what’s needed to grow crops. This includes buying tools, seeds, and taking care of their animals and families during the first year when they might not make much money yet. They have ongoing costs too, like buying seeds every year and maintaining their tools and animals.

After paying rent, farmers need to keep enough of what they produce to cover their initial costs and their yearly expenses. If they don’t get back what they spent, plus some profit, they can’t keep farming. If they can’t make a decent living, they’ll have to find another job. The money they need to keep farming should be protected. If landowners take too much from them, they will hurt their own land’s productivity and eventually the farmers won’t be able to pay their rent.
