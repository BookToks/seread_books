Adam Smith

The rules about bread prices have been around since at least the time of Henry II, who was Adam Smith's grandfather. These rules set the price of bread based on how much wheat costs, which could be anywhere from one shilling to twenty shillings back then. These laws are meant to take care of prices that are both lower and higher than the average price. 

Ten shillings, which had six ounces of silver, was seen as the average price for a quarter of wheat when these rules were first made. This price stayed the same during the 51st year of Henry III's reign. So, we can guess that the average price was not less than one-third of the highest price set by these laws, which would be around six shillings and eightpence, containing four ounces of silver.

From what we know, it seems that around the middle of the 14th century, the average price for a quarter of wheat was thought to be at least four ounces of silver. From the middle of the 14th century to the start of the 16th century, the average price of wheat slowly dropped to about half of that amount, landing at around two ounces of silver, which is about ten shillings today. This price stayed the same until about 1570.

In a household book from Henry, the fifth earl of Northumberland, made in 1512, there were two different prices for wheat. One price was six shillings and eightpence, and the other was five shillings and eightpence. In 1512, six shillings and eightpence was equal to about ten shillings today and contained only two ounces of silver.

From the 25th year of Edward III to the beginning of Elizabeth's reign, which is over two hundred years, six shillings and eightpence was seen as the average price for wheat. However, the amount of silver in that price kept getting smaller because of changes in coins. But it seems that the value of silver went up enough to balance out the decrease in the amount of silver in the coins.
