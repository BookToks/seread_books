The Wealth of Nations

Banks had money that was better than the regular money used in the country, so it was worth more. This extra value, called agio, changed depending on how bad the regular money was. For example, the bank in Hamburg had an agio of about fourteen percent because its money was better than the worn-out coins from nearby places.

Before 1609, Amsterdam had a lot of old and damaged foreign coins because of its big trade. This made the value of its money drop by about nine percent compared to new coins. Whenever new coins showed up, people melted them down or took them away. Merchants had a lot of money but sometimes couldnâ€™t find enough good coins to pay their bills, making the value of those bills uncertain, even with rules to try to fix it.

To solve these problems, a bank was created in 1609, backed by the city. This bank accepted both foreign coins and the worn coins from the country, giving them their true value in good money after taking out some costs for managing it. The bank then gave credit for the remaining value, called bank money. This bank money was always worth the same as the good coins and was worth more than regular money. They also made a rule that all bills worth 600 guilders or more in Amsterdam had to be paid in bank money, which removed any confusion about their value. Because of this rule, every merchant had to keep an account with the bank to pay their foreign bills, creating a demand for bank money.

Bank money had many benefits. It was safe from fire, theft, and other problems. The city of Amsterdam guaranteed it, and it could be transferred easily without counting or moving it around. Because of these advantages, bank money was always worth more, and people preferred to keep their money in the bank rather than take it out, since they could sell it for more in the market.
