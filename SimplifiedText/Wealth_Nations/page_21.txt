The Wealth of Nations

If you live in the countryside, you might not find many workers like carpenters or masons nearby. Families that live far from these workers often have to do a lot of small jobs themselves. In busy areas, they would just hire someone to help. 

Country workers usually have to learn to do many different types of jobs that are related. For example, a carpenter in the country works with all kinds of wood projects. A blacksmith works with iron. A country carpenter isn’t just a carpenter; they also do joinery, cabinet-making, wood carving, and even make wheels, plows, carts, and wagons. Blacksmiths have even more varied jobs. 

In remote areas, like the highlands of Scotland, it’s hard to find specialized workers, like someone who only makes nails. A nail maker could produce a lot of nails in a year, but there wouldn’t be enough demand for them in a small area. 

When there’s access to water transport, it opens up a bigger market for all kinds of work compared to just using land transport. This is why industries often start to grow and improve near the coast or along rivers, and it takes time for these improvements to reach inland areas. 

For example, a big wagon pulled by eight horses can carry about four tons of goods between London and Edinburgh in six weeks. But a ship with just six or eight crew members can carry around two hundred tons of goods in the same time. So, using water transport, a small crew can move the same amount of goods as fifty wagons with a hundred men and four hundred horses. 

Transporting two hundred tons of goods by land requires paying for a lot of people and horses for three weeks, plus the wear and tear on the wagons. But if you use a ship, you only have to pay for a few crew members and the upkeep of the ship, plus some extra for the risk involved. If there were no other way to get goods between these two places...
