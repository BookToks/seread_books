The Wealth of Nations

The money made from selling the ceded islands is £95,500. 

So, the total amount is £1,455,949. 

If we add the leftover money from the accounts of the Earl of Chatham and Mr. Calcraft, plus other army savings, and what we got from the bank, the East India Company, and the extra tax on land, the total is definitely over five million. 

Since the peace, the debt paid from the regular income of the state has been less than half a million each year. The sinking fund has grown a lot since the peace because of the debt that’s been paid off, the drop in interest rates from four percent to three percent, and the life annuities that have ended. If peace continues, we might be able to save a million each year to pay off the debt. 

Last year, another million was paid off, but we still have a big civil-list debt that isn’t paid, and now we’re in a new war that could cost as much as any previous wars. In fact, it has already cost more than any past wars and added over one hundred million to our debt. During a long peace of eleven years, we only paid off about ten million in debt. But during a seven-year war, we took on more than one hundred million in new debt. 

The new debt we might take on before the next campaign could be almost equal to all the old debt that has been paid off from the regular income. So, it’s unrealistic to think that we could ever fully pay off the public debt with the savings we might make from the current income. 

Some people say that the public funds of different countries in Europe, especially England, are like a big pile of money that helps the country grow. This money helps trade, creates more jobs, and improves land more than it would without this extra money. But they don’t realize that the money the first creditors gave to the government was taken from the annual production, which means it stopped being used to help workers and instead was used for things that don’t create new value.
