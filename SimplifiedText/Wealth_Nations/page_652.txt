Adam Smith says that using force and violence is the worst way for a government to act. People usually prefer to use force when they feel they can't use better methods like talking things out. For example, the French government chose to use force instead of trying to persuade people. 

However, using force is especially dangerous when it comes to the church leaders. Even in strict governments, the rights and freedoms of church leaders are usually respected more than those of other people in similar positions. This is true no matter how harsh or gentle the government is, from Paris to Constantinople. 

While church leaders are hard to control with force, they can be influenced easily in other ways. The safety of the ruler and the peace of the public depend a lot on how well the ruler can manage the church leaders. This usually involves giving them important positions or benefits. 

In the early Christian church, bishops were chosen by votes from both the clergy and the people in their city. But over time, the people lost this right and often followed the clergy's lead. The clergy eventually decided it was easier to pick their own bishops. Similarly, abbots were chosen by the monks in their monasteries. 

The bishop had control over many church positions in his area and could give them to whoever he wanted. While the ruler might have some influence in these choices, they didn't have enough power to directly control the clergy. Clergymen were more focused on gaining favor within their own group than with the ruler, as that's where they could get promotions. 

Across Europe, the pope slowly took control of most bishop and abbot positions and later gained influence over many lower church positions in each diocese through various strategies.
