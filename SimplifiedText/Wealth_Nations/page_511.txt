The Wealth of Nations

People usually want to invest their money in things that help society the most. But if they put too much money into one area, profits will drop there, and profits will rise in other areas. This will make them change where they invest their money. So, without any laws, people naturally spread their money around to different jobs in a way that benefits everyone.

However, rules from the mercantile system mess up this natural way of spreading money. The rules about trade with America and the East Indies mess it up the most because those trades take a lot of money compared to other trades. The way these rules work is different for each area, but both rely on monopoly, which means one group controls the market. Monopolies seem to be the main tool of the mercantile system.

When it comes to trade with America, each country tries to take over the market for its own colonies and keep other countries from trading with them. In the 1500s, the Portuguese tried to control trade in the East Indies by claiming they were the first to find the way there. The Dutch still keep other European countries from trading directly with their spice islands. These monopolies keep other countries from trading and force them to pay more for goods because they canâ€™t buy them directly from the source.

After Portugal lost its power, no European country has claimed exclusive rights to sail in the Indian seas, so now all European ships can access those ports. But in most European countries, except for Portugal and recently France, trade with the East Indies is controlled by exclusive companies. These monopolies end up hurting the very country that creates them, as most people in that country are affected negatively.
