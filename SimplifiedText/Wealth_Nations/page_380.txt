Adam Smith talks about how England's trade with other countries can affect its money situation. Even if England sells more to Holland than it buys, it might still have to send money there every year.

He explains that the way we usually figure out money exchange doesn’t always show the true financial situation. Sometimes, the real value of money can be very different from what we calculate, so we can’t always trust those numbers.

When you pay a certain amount of money in England that has a specific amount of pure silver, and then you get a bill to be paid in France with the same amount of silver, that’s called being at par. If you pay more, it means the exchange is not in England's favor. If you pay less, it’s in England's favor.

However, we can’t always tell how much money is worth just by looking at the mint standards. Some coins are worn down or damaged, which makes them worth less. The actual value of money in each country depends on how much silver it really has, not just what it should have. 

For example, before King William fixed the silver coins, the exchange rate between England and Holland looked bad for England. But the real value of English coins was actually lower than it should have been. So, even if it seemed like England was losing money, it might have been getting a better deal than it looked. Also, French coins were in better condition than English coins back then.
