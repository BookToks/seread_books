In small towns and villages, grocery items are usually cheaper. For example, bread and meat often cost the same or less there. It doesn't cost more to deliver groceries to a big city than to a small town, but bringing in corn and cattle is more expensive because they come from farther away. So, grocery prices are lower where sellers make less profit. However, the cost of bread and meat is higher in big cities than in small towns. Even if sellers make less profit in cities, those items can still be the same price or even cheaper sometimes. 

The bigger market in cities means more people buy more stuff, which lowers profits. But since supplies have to come from farther away, it raises costs. These two things often balance each other out. That's why prices for corn and cattle can be very different in various places, but bread and meat prices are usually pretty similar everywhere.

Even though people make less money from selling things in big cities compared to small towns, it's easier to get rich starting from a small amount in a city. In small towns, the market is limited, so you can't grow your business as much. Even if someone makes a lot of profit in a small town, the total amount they earn won't be very high. In big cities, businesses can grow as they get more money, and a hardworking person can build their reputation and profits quickly. 

However, most people don’t get rich just from one steady business. It usually takes a long time of hard work, saving money, and being careful. Sometimes, people do get rich quickly in cities by taking risks in different businesses. These risk-takers switch between different types of businesses, like selling corn one year and wine the next. They jump into whatever seems like it will make the most money and leave when they think it won’t.
