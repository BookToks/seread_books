The Wealth of Nations

The government spends money to make coins, and this doesn't really change anything for banks or private people who bring gold to be turned into coins. Even if there is a small fee for making coins, it doesn't affect the overall amount of money. If the coins are made with the right amount of gold, it doesn't cost anyone anything. But if the coins have less gold than they should, then it costs money to make up for that difference.

When the government pays for making coins, it spends some money and also misses out on some income it could have made from charging a fee. This doesn't help banks or anyone else at all. 

The bank's leaders probably wouldn’t want to charge a fee for making coins if it doesn’t help them make money and only protects them from losing money. Right now, since gold coins are weighed, they wouldn’t gain anything from changing this. But if weighing coins stops being the norm and the coins lose their value like they did before, the bank could save a lot of money by charging a fee.

The Bank of England is the only one that sends a lot of gold to be made into coins, so it handles most of the costs of making new coins. If making coins was just about replacing worn-out coins, it would only cost about £50,000 to £100,000 a year. But when coins lose weight, they need to make even more coins to replace those that are taken out of circulation or melted down. Because of this, in the years before the last big change to the gold coins, they were making over £850,000 a year. If there had been a fee of four or five percent on gold coins back then, it would have likely stopped the problems of exporting and melting down coins. Instead of losing about two and a half percent on the gold they were turning into coins, which cost them over £21,250 a year, they probably wouldn’t have lost nearly as much.
