Adam Smith talks about how some businesses can control trade in a way that makes it harder for others to compete. When a company has a monopoly, like the English East India Company, it means that other people in England can't trade the same goods. Because of this, they end up paying more for those goods than they would if everyone could trade freely. This monopoly not only allows the company to make huge profits but also leads to waste and problems in how the company is run. 

There are two types of monopolies. The first type always pulls more money and resources into that specific trade than would normally go there. The second type can either attract or push away money from that trade, depending on the situation. In poorer countries, monopolies tend to bring in more money to that trade. In richer countries, they often push money away from it.

For example, countries like Sweden and Denmark probably wouldn’t have sent any ships to the East Indies if there wasn’t an exclusive trading company. This kind of company encourages people to take risks because they know they won’t have to compete with others at home, and they can still compete internationally. The promise of big profits makes it more appealing for traders from poorer countries to invest in such a risky venture.

On the other hand, a wealthy country like Holland would likely send many more ships to the East Indies if trade was open. The limited resources of the Dutch East India Company actually keep a lot of potential big businesses from getting involved in that trade.
