The Wealth of Nations

Back in the day, the number of people living on the land was cut down to just what was needed to farm it, since farming wasn’t very advanced at that time. By getting rid of extra people and making sure the farmer paid the full value of the land, the landowner could make more money. Merchants and manufacturers then helped the landowner spend this money on himself, just like he did before. As this continued, the landowner wanted to raise the rent higher than what the land could actually support. The farmers agreed to this only if they could keep the land for a long enough time to make back their investment in improving it. The landowner, wanting to show off, agreed to this, which is how long leases started.

Even a tenant who pays the full rent isn’t completely at the mercy of the landlord. They both benefit financially from each other equally, and that tenant won’t risk their life or money for the landlord. But if they have a long lease, they are fully independent, and the landlord can’t expect anything from them except what’s written in the lease or what the law says.

As tenants became more independent and the extra workers were let go, the wealthy landowners couldn’t mess with the justice system or disturb the peace anymore. They sold their rights, not out of desperation like Esau did for food, but for silly things that were more like toys for kids than serious stuff for adults. Because of this, they became as unimportant as regular business people in a city. A stable government was set up in both the countryside and the city, and no one had enough power to disrupt things in either place.

This might not be directly related, but I want to point out that very old families who have owned land for many generations are pretty rare in places with a lot of trade. In places with less trade, like Wales or the Highlands of Scotland, such families are pretty common. Arabian histories are full of family trees, and there’s a history written by a Tartar Khan that has been translated into several European languages, which mostly talks about ancient families. This shows that old families are quite common in those cultures.
