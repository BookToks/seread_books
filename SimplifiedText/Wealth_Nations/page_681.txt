The Wealth of Nations

Some landlords make money by charging high rents, which can be bad for everyone in the community. If a landlord decides to farm some of their own land, the rent could be set fairly by talking with local farmers and landlords. They might even get a tax break if the rent for the land they farm is not too high. 

It’s important for landlords to farm some of their own land because they usually have more money than tenants. Even if they aren’t the best at farming, they can often produce more crops. Landlords can try new farming methods without worrying too much about losing money. If they succeed, it can help improve farming for everyone. 

However, the tax break should only encourage them to farm a little bit. If most landlords decide to farm all their land, it could lead to problems. Instead of hardworking tenants who care about their crops, there might be lazy managers who don’t take care of the land. This could lower the quality of farming and reduce the amount of food produced, which would hurt not just the landlords but everyone in society. 

Having a system like this could make the tax more predictable and fair for everyone involved. It could also help improve how land is managed and farmed across the country. Collecting a land tax that changes with rent might cost a bit more than a fixed tax, but the extra costs would likely be small compared to other taxes that don’t bring in much money. 

The biggest concern about a changing land tax is that it might discourage landlords from improving their land. If landlords feel uncertain about the tax, they might not invest in making their land better.
