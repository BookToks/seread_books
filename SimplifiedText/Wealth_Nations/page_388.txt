It could be different during a big disaster, like when the French invaded in 1672. At that time, everyone with money in the bank wanted to take it out and keep it safe. This made the demand for bank receipts go way up, and people might start asking for a lot more money than usual. Some might even expect to get half of the bank's money for the receipts they had. The enemy could find out how the bank worked and buy up those receipts to stop people from taking the money away. 

In situations like this, the bank might decide to break its usual rule of only paying people who had receipts. Those with receipts who didn’t have any bank money would get a small amount, like two or three percent of what their receipts were worth. So, the bank would pay out either cash or gold for the full value of what people with bank money were supposed to have, while also giving a little to those with receipts who didn’t have bank money. 

Even when things are calm, people with receipts want to lower the price of bank money. This way, they can either buy it cheaper or sell their receipts for more to those who want to take out gold. The price of a receipt usually matches the difference between the market price of bank money and the gold it can be exchanged for. On the other hand, people who own bank money want to raise the price so they can sell it for more or buy receipts for less. 

To stop these conflicting interests from causing problems, the bank decided to always sell bank money for currency at a five percent markup and buy it back at a four percent markup. Because of this decision, the price can never go above five percent or below four percent, keeping the value of bank money and currency closely matched. Before this change, the price of bank money sometimes went up to nine percent or down to its original value, depending on what people wanted. 

The Bank of Amsterdam claims it doesn’t lend out any of the money it has.
