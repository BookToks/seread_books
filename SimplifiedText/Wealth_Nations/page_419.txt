The Wealth of Nations

The capital of a country gets more help than it would on its own. Instead of messing up the natural balance of jobs, the goal is to make the work done in each job as good as it can be. The cost of premiums is pretty small, but bounties can be really expensive. For example, the bounty on corn alone has sometimes cost the public over £300,000 in just one year.

Bounties are sometimes called premiums, and drawbacks are sometimes called bounties. But we should focus on what these things actually are, not just the names.

I can't finish this chapter about bounties without saying that the praise for the law that gives a bounty for exporting corn is not deserved. If we look closely at the corn trade and the main British laws about it, we will see that this is true. This topic is important enough to spend some time on.

The corn trade has four different parts. Sometimes one person does all of them, but they are really four separate jobs. First, there’s the job of the inland dealer. Second, there’s the merchant who brings in corn for people to use at home. Third, there’s the merchant who exports corn from home to sell it in other countries. Fourth, there’s the merchant who brings in corn to export it again.

The inland dealer's interests and the interests of most people might seem different, but they are actually the same, even in tough years. The dealer wants to raise the price of corn as high as the real shortage requires, but not higher. If he raises the price too much, people will buy less corn, especially those with less money. If he raises it too high and there’s still too much corn left over, he risks losing some of it due to spoilage. Then he might have to sell what’s left for much less than he could have gotten before. On the other hand, if he doesn’t raise the price enough, people will buy too much, and there won’t be enough corn to meet the demand. Then he loses some of his corn too.
