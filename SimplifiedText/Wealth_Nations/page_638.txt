Adam Smith talks about how important it is to educate regular people in society. He thinks that the public should pay more attention to this than to the education of wealthy people. 

Wealthy kids usually start their careers around eighteen or nineteen. Before that, they have plenty of time to learn everything they need to be respected and successful. Their parents usually want them to be well-educated and are willing to spend money on their education. If these kids don’t get the right education, it’s often because the money is not spent wisely or the teachers aren’t good enough. Finding better teachers can be really hard too.

Wealthy people often have complicated jobs that make them think a lot. They don’t usually work all day long, so they have free time to learn more about different subjects that interest them. 

On the other hand, regular people don’t have much time for education. Their parents struggle to support them, even when they are young. As soon as they can work, they have to find a job to help support themselves. These jobs are usually simple and don’t require much thinking. Plus, the hard work leaves them with little time or energy to learn anything else. 

Even though regular people can’t get as much education as wealthy people, they can still learn the basics like reading, writing, and math when they are young. Most of them have time to learn these skills before they start working in their jobs.
