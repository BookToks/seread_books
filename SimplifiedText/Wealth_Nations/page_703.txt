The Wealth of Nations

Some people pretend to be really poor and act like they can’t pay for things because they’re scared of paying too much. This bad strategy might not actually help them in the long run. They probably lose more money because they produce less than they save on taxes. Even though this poor farming makes the market a bit worse, the small increase in prices isn’t enough to help farmers cover their costs or pay more rent to the landowners. Everyone—farmers, landowners, and the public—ends up suffering because of this bad farming.

I’ve already pointed out in another part of this book that certain taxes can discourage farming and hurt the main source of wealth in big countries. In places like the southern U.S. and the Caribbean, there are taxes called poll-taxes that charge a fee for every enslaved person. These taxes are really just fees on the profits from farming. Since many planters are both farmers and landowners, they end up paying these taxes as landowners without getting anything back.

In the past, similar taxes on enslaved people were common in Europe, and there’s still a similar tax in Russia today. Because of this, poll-taxes have often been seen as signs of slavery. However, every tax is actually a sign of freedom for the person paying it. It shows that they are part of a government and, since they own some property, they aren’t owned by someone else. A poll tax on enslaved people is very different from one on free people. The tax on free people is paid by them, while the tax on enslaved people is paid by their owners. The tax on free people can be unfair or random, while the tax on enslaved people is based on how many enslaved people the owner has, so it’s not random. 

In Holland, taxes on servants are based on how much money people spend, not on their property. This is similar to taxes on things people buy. A new tax in Great Britain charges a guinea for every male servant, which hits middle-class people the hardest. For someone making two hundred a year, they can only afford to keep one servant.
