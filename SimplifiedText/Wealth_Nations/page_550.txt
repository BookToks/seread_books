Adam Smith talks about how work adds value to a society's wealth. For example, if a worker does ten pounds worth of work in six months but also uses ten pounds worth of corn and other things to live, he still adds ten pounds to the overall value of what the society produces. 

Even though he used ten pounds worth of stuff, he created work that can buy the same amount. So, what was consumed and produced in those six months is actually worth twenty pounds, not just ten. If the corn and other necessities were used by someone else, like a soldier or a servant, the total value at the end of six months would be ten pounds less without the worker's contribution.

The value of what the worker makes is not always more than what he consumes at any one time, but overall, because of his work, the total value of goods available is higher. When people say that what workers, manufacturers, and merchants consume equals what they produce, they probably mean that their earnings match their spending. If they had said their earnings are equal to what they produce, it would be clear that saving some of that money would actually help increase the society's wealth.

Lastly, farmers and laborers canâ€™t increase the society's wealth without being careful about how they spend. The total wealth of a society can only grow in two ways: by making the work they do more efficient or by having more people working.
