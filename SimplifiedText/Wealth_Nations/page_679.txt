If silver coins were made in different amounts, like instead of being worth five shillings and two pence, they were worth two shillings and seven pence or ten shillings and four pence, it would affect the money people make in different ways. This could be a problem for either the landowners or the government.

Over time, things will change, and these situations will come up. Even though empires eventually fall apart, they all want to last forever. So, any rules made for an empire should work well not just in certain situations but in all situations. They should be based on things that are always true, not just on things that change or happen by chance.

Some people in France, who call themselves economists, think that a tax on land rent is the fairest kind of tax because it changes with the rent. They believe that all taxes end up affecting land rent, so they should be charged equally based on that. It’s true that taxes should be as fair as possible, but we don’t need to get into complicated arguments about their ideas to see which taxes actually affect land rent and which don’t.

In Venice, farmers who rent land have to pay a tax that is one-tenth of their rent. The leases are kept in a public record by tax officials in each area. If a landowner farms their own land, it gets valued fairly, and they can deduct one-fifth of the tax, so they only pay eight percent instead of ten percent of the estimated rent. 

This type of land tax is definitely fairer than the one in England. However, it might not always be as reliable, and figuring out the tax could cause more hassle for the landowner. It could also be more expensive to collect.
