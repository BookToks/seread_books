A paper currency that is worth less than gold and silver doesn’t make those metals less valuable. The value of gold and silver compared to other goods depends on how much gold and silver is being mined at the time, not on the amount of paper money in a country. It also depends on how much work it takes to get gold and silver to the market compared to other goods.

If banks are not allowed to make bank notes for small amounts and have to pay them back immediately when asked, they can operate safely in other ways. Recently, there have been more banks in the UK, which some people find scary, but this actually makes things safer for everyone. It forces banks to be careful and not print too much money compared to what they have in cash. This helps protect them from sudden demands for money, especially since there are so many banks competing with each other. 

Having more banks means that if one fails, it won’t be as big of a deal for everyone. This competition also makes banks treat their customers better because they don’t want to lose them to other banks. Overall, when there’s more competition in any business, it usually benefits the public more.
