In one way, silver has always been cheaper than gold, and it probably will always be. But right now, in Spain, gold might actually be a bit cheaper than silver. When we talk about something being expensive or cheap, it doesn't just depend on its usual price. It also depends on how much that price is above the lowest amount that sellers can accept for a long time. 

This lowest price is the one that just covers the costs of getting the item to market while making a small profit. It doesn't give anything to the landlord, and it only pays for wages and profit. Right now, in Spain, gold is closer to this lowest price than silver is. The king of Spain taxes gold at only 5%, while he taxes silver at 10%. These taxes are the main income from most gold and silver mines in Spanish America, and gold taxes are paid even less than silver taxes. 

Since gold mine owners don’t usually get rich, their profits are usually lower than those of silver mine owners. So, the price of gold in Spain must be closer to the lowest price than the price of silver. When you add up all the costs, it seems that gold can't be sold as well as silver can in Spain. The king of Portugal also taxes Brazilian gold at the same rate as the old tax on silver from Mexico and Peru, which is 20%. So, it’s hard to say if American gold is closer to the lowest price in Europe than American silver is.

Diamonds and other precious stones might be even closer to their lowest market price than gold is. 

It's unlikely that the tax on silver, which is a luxury item and brings in a lot of money, will ever be removed as long as people can pay it. However, just like in 1736 when the tax was lowered from 20% to 10% because people couldn’t pay it, it might need to be lowered again in the future.
