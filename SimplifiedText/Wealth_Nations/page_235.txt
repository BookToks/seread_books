The Wealth of Nations

Money is important for society because it helps everyone get what they deserve. Even though coins and bills move around and help people, they aren’t actually part of the wealth itself.

Next, machines and tools used for work are similar to money. If you can save money on building and maintaining these machines without hurting how much work they can do, it helps the overall wealth of society. The same goes for saving money on collecting and managing cash.

It's pretty clear how saving money on machines can help society's wealth. A business owner has to split their money between fixed capital (like machines) and circulating capital (like cash). If the total amount of money stays the same, then if one part is smaller, the other part has to be bigger. The circulating capital is what provides materials and pays workers, making everything run smoothly. So, if a business can save on fixed capital without hurting its work, it can use that extra money to boost production and wealth for everyone.

Using paper money instead of gold and silver makes trading cheaper and easier. It’s like switching to a new tool that costs less to use and maintain. However, how this change actually helps society’s wealth isn’t super clear and needs more explanation.

There are different types of paper money, but banknotes are the most common and useful. When people trust a bank and believe it will always have money to exchange for its notes, those notes become just as valuable as gold and silver. 

A bank can lend its own notes to customers, let’s say, up to a hundred thousand.
