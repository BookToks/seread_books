Adam Smith

The tax on shops was meant to be the same for everyone. This was important because if the tax was too high, it would hurt small shop owners and push them out of business. If only big shops were left, they would have no competition and could charge whatever they wanted. This would mean that customers would end up paying more, while the shop owners would just pocket the extra cash. Because of this, the idea of a tax on shops was dropped, and instead, they decided to use a subsidy.

In France, there’s a tax called the personal taille, which is a big tax on the profits made from farming. Back in the day, when Europe was ruled by feudal lords, the king could only tax people who were too weak to refuse. The powerful lords didn’t want to pay taxes regularly, and the king couldn’t force them to. Most people who worked the land were originally peasants. Over time, many of them gained their freedom. Some became landowners, while others just rented land for a number of years, making them less dependent on their lords.

The powerful lords didn’t like seeing these lower-class people becoming more independent and better off, so they allowed the king to tax them. In some places, this tax only applied to land owned under certain conditions, and that’s when it was called a real taille. There were also land taxes set up by the king of Sardinia and the taille in regions like Languedoc, Provence, Dauphine, and Brittany.
