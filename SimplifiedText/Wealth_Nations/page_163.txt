During this time, part of Europe was getting better at making things, and more people wanted silver. But there was so much silver available that its value dropped a lot. Even though the silver mines in America were found over twenty years earlier, they didn’t really affect prices in England until after 1570.

From 1595 to 1620, the average price for a quarter of nine bushels of the best wheat at Windsor market was about £2:1:6. If we ignore the small change and take away a ninth of that, the price for a quarter of eight bushels was around £1:16:10. After doing the same calculations for the middle-quality wheat, its price was about £1:12:8, which is roughly six ounces and a third of an ounce of silver.

From 1621 to 1636, the average price for the same amount of the best wheat went up to £2:10s. After similar deductions, the average price for the quarter of eight bushels of middle wheat was about £1:19:6, or around seven ounces and two-thirds of an ounce of silver.

Between 1630 and 1640, especially around 1636, the impact of the American silver mines on the value of silver seemed to have reached its peak. After this, silver didn’t drop in value compared to corn any lower than it did at that time. It may have gone up a bit in the following years, even before the last century ended.

From 1637 to 1700, which covers the last sixty-four years of the last century, the average price for a quarter of nine bushels of the best wheat at Windsor market was about £2:11:0 1/3. This was only a little more expensive than the previous sixteen years. However, during these sixty-four years, two major events happened that caused a bigger shortage of corn than usual, which explains why prices went up slightly without needing to assume that silver's value dropped even more.

The first event was the civil war, which made farming harder and messed up trade, causing corn prices to rise much higher than they would have otherwise.
