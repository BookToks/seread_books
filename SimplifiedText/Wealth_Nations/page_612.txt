Starting in 1708, or at least by 1711, a company had no competition and controlled all trade between England and the East Indies. They did really well and made enough money to give their owners a decent profit each year. 

When the French war began in 1741, a French governor named Mr. Dupleix got them involved in conflicts in India. They had some big wins and some big losses, and eventually, they lost Madras, which was their main place in India. They got it back later through a peace treaty. Around this time, the people working for them in India got really into fighting and trying to take over more land.

During another French war that started in 1755, they had a lot of good luck, just like Britain. They defended Madras, took over Pondicherry, got Calcutta back, and gained control of a rich area that was making them over three million a year. They kept this money for a few years, but in 1767, the government said that this land and the money from it belonged to them. To keep things smooth, the company agreed to pay the government £400,000 each year.

Before this, they had been increasing their profits from about six to ten percent. They were making around £320,000 a year for their owners. They wanted to raise it even more to twelve and a half percent, which would match what they were paying the government. But during the two years of their agreement with the government, they couldn’t raise their profits because of two laws that aimed to help them pay off their debts, which were over six or seven million pounds.

In 1769, they renewed their deal with the government for another five years and agreed they could slowly raise their profits to twelve and a half percent, but only by one percent each year. So, when they finally reached that maximum profit, they could pay their owners and the government together an extra £680,000 compared to what they were paying before they got the new land.
