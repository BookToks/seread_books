Adam Smith

In Rome, the main courts of justice had either one judge or a few judges. Because they made decisions in public, any unfair or hasty choices they made could really affect their reputation. When faced with tough decisions, these judges often looked to past judges for guidance to avoid blame. This focus on following past examples helped shape Roman law into a clear and organized system that we still recognize today. Other countries that paid attention to this also developed better legal systems. 

The Romans were often seen as having better character than the Greeks, and this was likely due to how their courts worked rather than what other writers suggested. Romans were known for taking oaths seriously. People who swore oaths in front of knowledgeable judges were more likely to care about what they promised than those who did so in front of chaotic crowds.

Both the Greeks and Romans were just as skilled in civil and military matters as any modern nation. We might even think too highly of them. However, besides military training, the state didnâ€™t really focus on developing these skills. I doubt that learning music was that important for their abilities. Still, there were teachers for the upper class in every art and science that their society needed. This demand for learning led to the development of teaching skills, and the competition among teachers pushed them to become really good at what they did.

The ancient philosophers had a big impact on their listeners and were better at influencing people's thoughts and behaviors than modern teachers. Nowadays, public teachers can be affected by things that make them less focused on their success and reputation. Their pay can also affect how well they teach.
