Adam Smith talks about how trade with other countries has changed things in Europe. In some cities, trading with other places brought in better products that were good for selling far away. This trade and the products made from it also helped improve farming. The way people lived and the rules from their old governments pushed them into this strange situation.

When the German and Scythian tribes took over the western parts of the Roman Empire, it caused a lot of chaos that lasted for many years. The violence from these tribes made it hard for towns and farms to work together. Many towns were abandoned, and farms were left untended. The western parts of Europe, which were once wealthy under Roman rule, became very poor and uncivilized. 

During this time of chaos, the leaders of these tribes took most of the land for themselves. Much of the land was not being farmed, but every piece of land had an owner. Most of it ended up being owned by a few wealthy people. This grabbing of unused land was a big deal.
