Adam Smith says that good roads, canals, and rivers help make it easier and cheaper to transport goods. This means that faraway areas can compete better with towns. These improvements are really important because they help farmers in remote areas grow more crops. They also help towns by making it harder for local farmers to have all the power. Even though new products might come into the market, they also create new opportunities for farmers to sell their goods. 

Having competition is good for everyone because it pushes people to manage their businesses better. About fifty years ago, some counties near London asked the government to stop new roads from being built to faraway places. They were worried that farmers in those areas could sell their grass and corn for less money because labor was cheaper there. They thought this would lower their rents and hurt their farming. But actually, rents have gone up, and farming has improved since then.

A cornfield that isn’t super fertile can still produce a lot more food than a pasture of the same size. Even though growing corn takes more work, the extra food left over after paying for seeds and labor is also much greater. So, if a pound of meat is worth about the same as a pound of bread, that extra food is more valuable and helps both the farmer and the landlord. This has been true since farming first started.

However, the value of bread and meat changes over time. In the early days of farming, most of the land was used for cattle, so there was more meat than bread. Because of this, bread became more valuable since everyone wanted it. For example, in Buenos Ayres, a long time ago, an ox could be bought for just a few coins, while the price of bread wasn’t mentioned because it was probably normal. Catching an ox didn’t cost much, but growing corn was harder to do.
