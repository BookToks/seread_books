The money made from coins is only about fourteen thousand pounds a year. The actual cost for the government, like the salaries of the mint workers, is usually less than half of that amount. Saving such a small amount of money, or even making a little more, might seem unimportant to the government. But saving eighteen or twenty thousand pounds a year, especially if something likely happens, is definitely something the Bank of England should pay attention to.

Some of the ideas I talked about earlier might have fit better in the first book, where I discussed where money comes from and how to tell the real price of things from their fake price. But since the law encouraging coin production comes from common misunderstandings caused by the trading system, I thought it was better to keep those ideas for this chapter. The trading system really likes the idea of giving rewards for making money, which it believes is what makes a country wealthy. It's just one of the many smart ways to make the country richer.

The reasons for starting European colonies in America and the West Indies weren’t as clear as those for the ancient Greek and Roman colonies. The city-states in ancient Greece were small, and when the population grew too big for the land to support, some people would leave to find new places to live. They couldn’t expand their land much because they were surrounded by enemy states. The Dorians mostly settled in Italy and Sicily, which were home to wild and uncivilized tribes before Rome was founded. The Ionians and Aeolians, two other major Greek groups, moved to Asia Minor and the nearby islands.
