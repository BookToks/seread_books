The Wealth of Nations

To get more money into a country's shipping industry, you can't just push it harder than what would normally happen. 

When a country uses its money for local trade, it usually helps create more jobs and increases the value of what the country produces each year. This is better than using the same amount of money for foreign trade. Also, using money for foreign trade has even more benefits than using it for shipping goods. The wealth and power of a country depend on how much it produces each year, which is where all taxes come from. The main goal of a country's economy is to make it richer and more powerful. So, it shouldn't favor foreign trade over local trade or shipping over the other two. It shouldn't force or trick money into those areas more than what would naturally happen.

Each type of trade is important and necessary when things happen naturally without any pressure. If a certain industry produces more than what people in the country want, the extra has to be sent to other countries in exchange for things that are wanted at home. If this doesn't happen, some jobs will stop, and the country's overall production will go down. For example, Great Britain usually makes more corn, wool, and tools than people in the country want. So, the extra has to be sent out and traded for things that people want. This is the only way to make sure the extra goods are worth enough to cover the work and costs of making them. 

Being close to the sea or rivers is good for business because it makes it easier to send out extra goods and trade them for things that are needed. When the foreign goods bought with the extra production are more than what people at home want, the extra has to be sent out again and traded for things that are more in demand. For example, about 96,000 barrels of tobacco are bought every year in Virginia and Maryland.
