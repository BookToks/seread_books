Adam Smith

In America, some drinks can only be kept for a few days, so families have to make them at home, just like they cook their food. It wouldn’t be fair to have tax collectors checking every family’s home like they do with bars and breweries. If a tax on these drinks is needed for fairness, it could be done by taxing the ingredients used to make them. This could happen either where they are made or by charging a tax when they are brought into the area where they will be used.

For example, there’s already a tax of one penny per gallon on molasses brought into America from Britain. In Massachusetts, there’s an extra tax of eight pence for molasses brought in from other colonies, and South Carolina has a tax of five pence per gallon for molasses coming from the northern colonies. If these methods don’t work, families could pay a tax based on how many people are in their household, similar to how people in England pay a tax on malt. 

This way of taxing things that people use quickly isn’t always the best, but it could work if there are no better options. Sugar, rum, and tobacco are not essential for life but are used by many people, making them good choices for taxes. If the colonies and Britain were to unite, these items could be taxed either before they leave the factory or farm. If that doesn’t work, they could be stored in public warehouses until they are sold. The tax wouldn’t need to be paid until the items are given to the buyer. When these items are sent out of the country, they could be tax-free if the right guarantees are made that they will actually leave. These are some of the main items that would be affected by a union with the colonies.
