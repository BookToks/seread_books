The Wealth of Nations

The way Britain trades with its colonies has messed up the balance of its economy. Instead of having many small businesses, most of Britain's industry focuses on one big market. This means that their trade is mostly funneled through one main route instead of spreading out. Because of this, Britain's economy is less stable and healthy than it could be. 

Right now, Britain is like a sick body where some parts are too big and out of shape. If something goes wrong with that big part, it could cause serious problems for the whole country. People in Britain are more scared of losing their colonies than they ever were of a Spanish fleet or a French attack. This fear, whether it makes sense or not, led to the repeal of the stamp act, which many merchants supported. 

If Britain were to lose access to the colony market, even for a few years, many merchants thought it would ruin their businesses. Most factory owners believed it would destroy their work, and many workers feared they would lose their jobs. When Britain has conflicts with other countries in Europe, people donâ€™t panic as much because they think the effects will be smaller. If a small part of the economy is affected, it can usually recover without causing major issues. But if something happens to that big part, it could lead to chaos or even collapse. If one of those big industries, which have been artificially boosted by government support, faces a small problem, it can create a huge uproar that worries the government and complicates things for everyone.
