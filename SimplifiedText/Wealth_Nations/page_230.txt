Adam Smith talks about how the value of everything a country produces each year is divided into three parts. This value is shared among the people living in that country as wages for their work, profits from their businesses, or rent for their land.

Just like with a private estate, we can separate the total rent into two parts: gross rent and net rent. Gross rent is what the farmer pays, while net rent is what the landlord keeps after paying for things like repairs and management. The landlord's true wealth comes from the net rent, not the gross rent.

For everyone in a big country, gross revenue includes everything produced from their land and labor. Net revenue is what they have left after covering their basic expenses. This leftover money is what they can use for their needs and fun. Just like the landlord, people's real wealth is based on their net revenue, not the gross.

When we talk about fixed capital, which includes things like buildings and machines, we need to remember that the costs to maintain them shouldn't be counted as part of the society's net revenue. The materials and labor needed to keep these things running donâ€™t contribute to the net revenue. However, the wages paid to workers can be part of it since those workers can spend their earnings.

The purpose of fixed capital is to help workers be more productive, allowing them to do more work with the same number of people. For example, on a well-maintained farm with all the necessary buildings and equipment in good shape, the same number of workers can get a lot more done.
