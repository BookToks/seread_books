The Wealth of Nations was written in 1769. If we look at the average prices today compared to those ancient times, prices are probably a bit higher now. Hides, which are animal skins, are not as easy to transport as wool. They don’t last as long when stored. A salted hide is seen as worse than a fresh one and sells for less. This means that in places that don’t make hides but have to sell them, the price will likely drop. In places that do make them, the price might go up. So, in the past, prices probably went down, and now they go up. 

Tanners, who work with hides, haven’t been as good as cloth makers at showing that their work is important for the country’s success. Because of this, they haven’t received as much support. Selling raw hides to other countries has been banned, but bringing them in from other places has a tax. Even though this tax was removed for hides from Ireland and certain colonies for five years, Ireland can still sell its extra hides anywhere, not just to Great Britain. Recently, the hides from regular cattle have been restricted to only being sold to the mother country, but Ireland hasn’t faced heavy restrictions to help British businesses.

Any rules that lower the prices of wool or hides below what they should be will likely raise the prices of meat in a developed country. The prices for both large and small cattle raised on good land need to be high enough to cover the rent for landowners and the profits for farmers. If they aren’t, farmers will stop raising them. So, if wool and hides sell for less, the price of meat must go up. How this price is split among different parts of the animal doesn’t matter to the landowners and farmers, as long as they get paid. In a developed country, the interests of landowners and farmers won’t be much affected by these rules, but consumers might feel the impact from rising food prices. In a less developed country, however, it would be a different story.
