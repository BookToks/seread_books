To keep them working well, their masters need to make sure they are fed properly and feel good, just like they would for their work animals.

So, the amount of taxed goods they consume would probably be just as high in America and the West Indies as in other parts of the British Empire.

If the taxes on malt and malt drinks were changed to just one tax on malt, it would make smuggling a lot harder. Also, if customs taxes were only on a few commonly used items instead of almost everything, it would reduce smuggling opportunities, even if it didn’t completely eliminate them. With these simple changes, the taxes could still bring in as much money as they do now, even in less populated areas.

People say that Americans don’t have gold or silver money, and they use paper money for trade. The gold and silver that comes to America usually gets sent back to Great Britain to pay for goods. Some think that without gold and silver, Americans can’t pay taxes. But we already take all the gold and silver they have, so how can we expect them to give us more?
