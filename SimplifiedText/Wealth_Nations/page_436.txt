Adam Smith

The law says that wheat can't be exported when its price goes above forty-four shillings per quarter. Rye can't be exported if it goes above twenty-eight shillings, barley above twenty-two shillings, and oats above fourteen shillings. These prices seem way too low. It doesn't make sense to stop exports at these prices when the extra money that was supposed to encourage exports is taken away. They should have either removed the extra money at a lower price or allowed exports at a higher price.

So, this law seems worse than the old system. Even with its problems, we could say it’s like the laws of Solon: not the best, but the best that fits the interests and attitudes of the time. Maybe it will lead to something better later.

CHAPTER V

When a country makes a deal to allow certain goods from one foreign country while blocking others, or to let goods from one country in without taxes while taxing others, the country and its businesses benefit a lot. The businesses get a kind of monopoly, meaning they have less competition. This makes the market bigger and better for their products. The market is bigger because other countries' goods are either blocked or taxed more, so people buy more of theirs. It’s better for them because they can often sell their goods for higher prices without having to compete with everyone else.

However, these deals can hurt the businesses in the country that makes the deal. They end up giving a monopoly to a foreign country, which is unfair to their own businesses.
