Adam Smith talked about how some money rewards, called bounties, changed over time. 

At first, the bounty for tar was £4 for each ton, and the same for pitch. For turpentine, it was £3 per ton. Later, the £4 bounty for tar was only for a special kind, while the bounty for regular tar dropped to £2.4s per ton. The bounty for pitch went down to £1, and for turpentine, it became £1.10s per ton.

The second bounty was for importing indigo from British plantations. When plantation indigo was worth about 75% of the best French indigo, it got a bounty of 6d per pound. This bounty lasted for a while but was later lowered to 4d per pound. It ended after the parliamentary session that followed March 25, 1781.

The third bounty was for importing hemp or undressed flax from British plantations. This was set up around the time when America and Britain were having some issues. It lasted for 21 years, from June 24, 1764, to June 24, 1785. For the first seven years, the bounty was £8 per ton, then it dropped to £6 for the next seven years, and finally to £4. Scotland didn’t get this bounty because its climate wasn't great for growing hemp, and it would have hurt local farmers.

The fourth bounty was for importing wood from America. This lasted for nine years, from January 1, 1766, to January 1, 1775. In the first three years, the bounty was £1 for every 120 good deals of wood and 12s for every load of other square timber. In the next three years, it changed to 15s for deals and 8s for other squared timber. In the last three years, it became 10s for deals and 5s for other squared timber.

The fifth bounty was for importing raw silk from British plantations. This lasted for 21 years, from January 1, 1770, to January 1, 1791. For the first seven years, it was £25 for every £100 worth of silk, then it dropped to £20 for the next seven years, and finally to £15 for the last seven years.
