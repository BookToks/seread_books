If the tolls on roads in Great Britain ever become a way for the government to get money, we can see from other countries what might happen. These tolls are usually paid by the people who buy things, but they don’t pay based on how much they spend. Instead, they pay based on how heavy or big the stuff is. When taxes are based on the value of the goods instead of their size or weight, they act like extra taxes that can really hurt local businesses.

In some small countries, there are similar taxes on goods that are moved through their land or waters from one foreign country to another. These are called transit duties. Some small Italian states along the Po River make money from these taxes, and they are paid mostly by foreigners. This is one of the few taxes that one country can put on people from another country without messing up its own economy. The biggest transit duty in the world is charged by the king of Denmark on all ships that pass through a certain strait.

Taxes on luxury items, like most customs and excise duties, affect everyone differently. Even though everyone pays these taxes when they buy things, it doesn’t mean they pay the same amount based on how much money they have. How much someone spends depends on their personal choices. So, people who spend a lot end up paying more, while those who are careful with their money pay less than they should. 

When a wealthy person is young, they usually don’t pay much in taxes because they don’t spend much. People living in another country don’t contribute anything to the government where they make money. If that country doesn’t have a land tax or big fees for moving property, like in Ireland, these people can make a lot of money without paying anything to support the government. This unfairness is often worse in countries where the government relies on another country for support.
