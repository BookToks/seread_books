The people working for the company have tried many times to take control of some of the most important parts of trade, both with other countries and within their own. If they had been allowed to keep doing this, they would have eventually tried to limit how much of certain products they would let be made, only allowing enough for what they could buy and sell for a good profit. Over a hundred or two hundred years, the way the English company acted could have been just as harmful as the Dutch company's actions.

However, this harmful plan goes against what is really best for those companies, especially since they rule over the countries they have taken over. In most places, the ruler's money comes from the people. The more money the people make, the more they can give to the ruler. So, it’s in the ruler's best interest to help the people produce as much as possible. This is especially true for a ruler like the one in Bengal, whose income mainly comes from land rent. That rent depends on how much and how valuable the products are, which is linked to how big the market is. 

The amount of products will usually match how much people want to buy, and the prices will depend on how competitive buyers are. So, it’s in the ruler's best interest to create a big market for their country’s products and to allow free trade. This means getting rid of monopolies and any limits on moving goods around the country or sending them to other countries. By doing this, the ruler can increase both the amount and value of products, which also boosts their own income.

But it seems that a group of merchants can’t see themselves as rulers, even when they are. They still think their main job is to trade, which means buying things to sell them again. They weirdly see being a ruler as just an extra role that should help them buy things cheaper in India.
