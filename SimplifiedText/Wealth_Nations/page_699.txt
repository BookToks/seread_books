The tax on stocks in England, set by the land tax bill, is based on how much money people have. But it’s not meant to take away any of that money. It’s just a tax on the interest people earn from their money, similar to how rent is taxed. So, if the rent tax is four shillings for every pound, then the tax on interest is also four shillings for every pound. Other places like Hamburg, Underwald, and Zurich have similar taxes that focus on the interest or profit from stocks, not the actual money itself. In Holland, the tax was meant to be on the money itself.

In some countries, there are special taxes on the profits from stocks, especially when used in certain types of businesses or farming. In England, there’s a tax on street vendors, taxi services, and a fee that people who sell beer and spirits have to pay. During the last war, there was talk of a new tax on shops because it was said that the war was to protect trade, so the merchants benefiting from it should help pay for it.

However, a tax on profits from specific businesses usually ends up being paid by the customers. Dealers need to make a reasonable profit, and in a fair market, they usually can’t make much more than that. So, when dealers have to pay a tax, they just add it to the price of their goods, and customers end up paying for it, often with a little extra charge.

When the tax is based on how much business a dealer does, it doesn’t hurt them and is paid by the customers. But if the tax is the same for everyone, it can help bigger businesses and make it harder for smaller ones. For example, the tax on taxi services and the fee for chairs is fair because it matches how much business they do. It doesn’t favor big businesses or hurt small ones. But the fees for selling beer, spirits, and wine are the same for everyone, which can give bigger sellers an advantage and make it tougher for smaller sellers since they can more easily recover the tax in their prices.
