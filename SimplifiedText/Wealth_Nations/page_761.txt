The Wealth of Nations

When a country already has a lot of taxes, people will only accept new taxes if there's a big reason, like going to war or feeling unsafe. This is why the money meant to pay off debt often gets used incorrectly.

In Great Britain, since we started using the bad idea of always borrowing money, the amount of public debt has grown way faster during wars than it has shrunk during peaceful times. The huge debt we have now started during the war that began in 1668 and ended in 1697.

By the end of 1697, Great Britain's total debts were about £21.5 million. A lot of this debt was from short-term loans, and some was for life annuities. In less than four years, by the end of 1701, they managed to pay off over £5 million, which was more than they’ve paid off in such a short time since then. So, the remaining debt was about £16.4 million.

In the war that started in 1702 and ended with the treaty of Utrecht, the public debt grew even more. By the end of 1714, it was around £53.7 million. The South-sea fund, which included short and long annuities, made the debt even bigger, reaching about £55.3 million by the end of 1722. They started paying off the debt in 1723, but it was really slow. By the end of 1739, after 17 years of peace, they had only paid off about £8.3 million, while the total debt was still around £46.9 million.

The Spanish war that began in 1739 and the French war that followed made the debt go up again. By the end of 1748, after the war ended with the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the debt was about £78.3 million. Even after 17 years of peace, they had only paid off a little over £8 million, while a war that lasted less than nine years added over £31 million to the debt.

During Mr. Pelham's time in charge, they tried to lower the interest on the public debt from four to three percent, increased the sinking fund, and paid off some of the debt. In 1755,
