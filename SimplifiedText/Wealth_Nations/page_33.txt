In some situations, things can be cheap in one place and expensive in another. But really, it’s the items that are cheap in one place and costly in another.

So, when we talk about work, it can have two kinds of prices: a real price and a nominal price. The real price is about how much stuff you can get with your pay, like food and other necessities. The nominal price is just the amount of money you earn. A worker is considered rich or poor based on the real price of their work, not just the money they make.

Understanding the difference between real and nominal prices is important. The real price stays the same in value, but the nominal price can change a lot because of how gold and silver are valued at different times. For example, if someone sells land and wants to keep a rent that stays valuable, it’s better if that rent isn’t just a fixed amount of money. This is because the value of that money can change in two ways: first, the amount of gold and silver in coins can vary over time, and second, the value of gold and silver can change.

Kings and governments often think it’s a good idea to reduce the amount of metal in their coins, but they rarely think about increasing it. Because of this, the amount of metal in coins has mostly been going down, which usually makes money less valuable.

When gold and silver mines were found in America, it made these metals less valuable in Europe. Many people believe this decrease is still happening and will continue for a long time. Because of this, it’s more likely that the value of money rent will go down rather than up, even if it’s supposed to be paid in a specific amount of silver instead of just a set amount of money.

Rents paid in crops have kept their value better than those paid in money, even if the money hasn’t changed. For example, a law from Queen Elizabeth I said that a third of the rent for college leases should be paid in crops, either directly or based on current market prices.
