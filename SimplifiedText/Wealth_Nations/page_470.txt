Great Britain keeps some of the best products from its colonies for itself. To make up for that, it gives some colonies a better deal in the market. Sometimes, this means charging higher taxes on similar products from other countries. Other times, it means giving money back for bringing in products from the colonies. This helps the colonies sell their sugar, tobacco, and iron better. It also helps with their raw silk, hemp, flax, indigo, naval supplies, and timber. The way Britain encourages its colonies with money back is something unique to them. Other countries, like Portugal, just charge higher taxes or even ban things like tobacco from other places.

When it comes to bringing in goods from Europe, England treats its colonies better than other countries do. Britain lets its colonies get some of the money back from the taxes paid on foreign goods when they send those goods to other countries. If they didn’t do this, no other country would want to buy those goods because they would be too expensive due to the heavy taxes. So, giving some money back is important for trade.

However, our colonies aren’t independent countries. Britain has the right to be the only one supplying them with goods from Europe. They could have made the colonies pay the same heavy taxes as other countries do. But until 1763, the colonies got the same money back on foreign goods as independent countries did. In 1763, a new law changed that a bit. It said that no money back would be given for certain goods from Europe or the East Indies sent to British colonies, except for wines and some fabrics. Before this law, many foreign goods were cheaper in the colonies than in Britain, and some still might be. Most of the rules about colony trade are important for the merchants who are involved in it.
