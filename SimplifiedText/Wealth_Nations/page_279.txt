The Wealth of Nations

Bankruptcies happen to only a tiny number of people in business, maybe just one in a thousand. For someone who is innocent, going bankrupt is one of the worst things that can happen. Most people try hard to avoid it. Some people, though, end up in that situation, just like some people end up on death row.

Big countries usually don’t lose money because of private businesses, but they can lose money because of bad government spending. In many countries, most of the public money goes to support people who don’t create anything. This includes fancy courts, big churches, and large armies. During peacetime, these groups don’t produce anything, and during wartime, they don’t earn back what they cost to keep. 

Since these unproductive people don’t make anything, they rely on the work of others. If there are too many of them, they can eat up a lot of the resources, leaving less for the workers who need to produce more for the next year. If this keeps happening, the next year will have even less to offer than the last. Those who should only take a little from the people's earnings might end up taking so much that it forces many to use up their savings meant for productive work. This can lead to a big drop in what can be produced, no matter how careful and responsible individuals are.

However, being careful and responsible usually helps to balance out not just the wastefulness of individuals but also the government’s overspending. The consistent effort of everyone trying to improve their lives is what helps a country grow, even when the government is wasteful or makes big mistakes. It’s like how living things can recover from sickness, even when doctors make bad decisions.

The total value of what a country produces each year can only go up if there are more workers who can produce or if the workers become more efficient at what they do.
