Adam Smith

It controls how much money things from the land cost, like corn, grass, hay, meat, and even horses. This price changes over time, but it always affects how much everything else costs. For example, if corn prices go up, the prices for things like grass and meat will also change.

When the price of corn goes up, it also affects how much workers get paid. If workers earn more, it can change the cost of making stuff. So, if corn prices go up, everything else that comes from land or labor will also change in price.

Even if farmers can sell their corn for more money, like 4 shillings instead of 3 shillings and 6 pence, it doesn’t really help them or their landlords if the higher price doesn’t buy them more things. If 4 shillings can buy the same amount of stuff as 3 shillings and 6 pence did before, then neither the farmer nor the landlord will be better off. They might get a slight benefit when buying things from other countries, but not when buying local products, which is what they spend most of their money on.

When the value of silver goes down because there’s more of it available, it doesn’t really matter much for any specific country. Prices may go up, but that doesn’t make people richer or poorer in real terms. For example, fancy silverware might cost less, but everything else stays the same.

However, if the value of silver drops because of something specific to a country, that can be a big deal. It doesn’t make anyone richer and can actually make everyone poorer. When prices go up just in that country, it can hurt local businesses and make it easier for other countries to compete.
