Some people might talk about him, but there aren’t many jobs in mechanics that can’t be explained clearly in a short pamphlet. The French Academy of Sciences is actually publishing a history of the arts where many of these jobs are explained this way. 

The way things are done can change with the weather and other factors, so it takes a lot more skill and judgment than jobs that are pretty much the same all the time. 

Farming, for example, and many other country jobs need more skill and experience than most mechanical jobs. A person working with metals like brass and iron uses tools and materials that are usually pretty consistent. But a farmer who plows the field with horses or oxen has to deal with animals that can be strong or weak depending on the day. The conditions of the soil also change, and both the animals and the soil need careful handling. 

Even though people often think of farmers as not very smart, they usually have good judgment and know how to make decisions. Farmers might not talk to people as much as mechanics in towns do, and their way of speaking can be hard to understand for those not used to it. However, farmers have to think about many different things, which often makes them smarter than mechanics, who usually focus on just one or two simple tasks all day. 

It’s well known that people in country jobs are often better off than those in towns. In places like China and India, country workers are said to earn more and have a higher status than many city workers. This would probably be true everywhere if it weren't for laws that favor city workers. 

The advantage that city workers have over country workers in Europe isn’t just because of these laws. There are many other rules that help city industries, like high taxes on foreign goods and imports. These laws help city residents earn more and keep their jobs secure.
