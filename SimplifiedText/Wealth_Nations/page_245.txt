The Wealth of Nations
of this sum, together with the interest and commission, some of
those banks, from the distress into which their excessive circula-
tion had thrown them, had sometimes no other means of satisfy-
ing this draught, but by drawing a second set of bills, either upon
the same, or upon some other correspondents in London; and the
same sum, or rather bills for the same sum, would in this manner
make sometimes more than two or three journeys; the debtor bank
paying always the interest and commission upon the whole accu-
mulated sum. Even those Scotch banks which never distinguished
themselves by their extreme imprudence, were sometimes obliged
to employ this ruinous resource.
The gold coin which was paid out, either by the Bank of En-
gland or by the Scotch banks, in exchange for that part of their
paper which was over and above what could be employed in the
circulation of the country, being likewise over and above what
could be employed in that circulation, was sometimes sent abroad
in the shape of coin, sometimes melted down and sent abroad in
the shape of bullion, and sometimes melted down and sold to the
Bank of England at the high price of four pounds an ounce. It was
the newest, the heaviest, and the best pieces only, which were care-
fully picked out of the whole coin, and either sent abroad or melted
down. At home, and while they remained in the shape of coin,
those heavy pieces were of no more value than the light; but they
were of more value abroad, or when melted down into bullion at
home. The Bank of England, notwithstanding their great annual
coinage, found, to their astonishment, that there was every year
the same scarcity of coin as there had been the year before; and
that, notwithstanding the great quantity of good and new coin
which was every year issued from the bank, the state of the coin,
instead of growing better and better, became every year worse and
worse. Every year they found themselves under the necessity of
coining nearly the same quantity of gold as they had coined the
year before; and from the continual rise in the price of gold bul-
lion, in consequence of the continual wearing and clipping of the
coin, the expense of this great annual coinage became, every year,
greater and greater. The Bank of England, it is to be observed, by
supplying its own coffers with coin, is indirectly obliged to supply
the whole kingdom, into which coin is continually flowing from
those coffers in a great variety of ways. Whatever coin, therefore,
was wanted to support this excessive circulation both of Scotch
and English paper money, whatever vacuities this excessive circu-
lation occasioned in the necessary coin of the kingdom, the Bank
of England was obliged to supply them. The Scotch banks, no
doubt, paid all of them very dearly for their own imprudence and
inattention: but the Bank of England paid very dearly, not only
for its own imprudence, but for the much greater imprudence of
