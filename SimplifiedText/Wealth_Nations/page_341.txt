The idea that wealth is just money, or gold and silver, is something many people believe. This comes from how money works in two ways: it helps us buy things and it tells us how much things are worth. When we have money, it's easier to get what we need compared to using other stuff. The main goal for most people is to get money. Once you have money, buying things becomes easy. 

We also use money to figure out how valuable other things are. For example, we say a rich person is worth a lot of money, while a poor person is worth very little. If someone is careful with their money or wants to be rich, we say they love money. On the other hand, if someone is careless or generous, we say they don’t care much about it. So, getting rich means getting money, and in everyday talk, wealth and money are pretty much the same thing.

A rich country is thought to have a lot of money, just like a rich person. People believe that collecting gold and silver is the best way to make a country rich. After America was discovered, the Spaniards would always ask if there was gold or silver in new places they found. This helped them decide if it was worth settling there or conquering the land. Similarly, a monk named Plano Carpino, who was sent by the king of France to meet a son of Gengis Khan, said that the Tartars often asked if there were many sheep and cows in France. They wanted to know if the land was rich enough to conquer. For the Tartars, who didn’t really use money, cattle were what counted as wealth, just like gold and silver were for the Spaniards. In a way, the Tartar view might be closer to the truth.

Mr. Locke points out that money is different from other goods. He says that other goods can be used up quickly, so wealth based on them isn’t very reliable. A country that has a lot of these goods one year might not have them the next year just because people used them all up.
