Adam Smith talks about how people use money to buy things, especially when it comes to foreign goods. He believes that while some individuals might spend a lot more money without earning more, most people tend to be careful with their money. This means that, as a group, lazy people won’t really increase their spending just because of banking activities. 

Even if a few lazy individuals spend more, the overall demand for foreign goods from these people stays pretty much the same. Most of the money that goes out to buy foreign goods will be used for work and not for being lazy. 

When we think about how much work can be done with the money in society, we should only count the things that are actually used to create products, like food, materials, and finished items. Money itself is just a way to buy those things and doesn’t help in making anything. 

To get work done, we need three things: materials to work on, tools to work with, and payment for the workers. Money isn’t a material or a tool. Even though workers get paid in money, what really matters is what they can buy with that money, not the money itself. 

The amount of work that can be done depends on how many workers can be given the right materials, tools, and pay. Money is needed to buy these things, but the total amount of work that can be done is based on the value of the materials and tools, not just the money spent on them. 

When paper money replaces gold and silver, the total amount of materials, tools, and pay that can be provided might increase by the value of the gold and silver that was previously used for buying.
