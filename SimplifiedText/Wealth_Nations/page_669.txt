The Wealth of Nations

Democracies can sometimes be wasteful, so it's not clear if they can handle big projects well. 

The post office is a business idea that works well. The government pays to set up different offices and gets the horses or cars needed. Then, they make money back from the fees on what is delivered. It’s probably the only business that has been successfully run by all kinds of governments. The money needed to start isn’t too much, and the process is pretty straightforward. The returns are not only guaranteed but also come quickly.

However, kings and queens often try to get into other business ventures to make money, just like regular people do. But they usually don’t do well. Their lavish spending makes it hard for them to succeed. The people working for a king think their boss has endless money, so they don’t care about how much they spend when buying or selling things. These workers often live like royalty too, and sometimes they even end up getting rich themselves by managing the money well. For example, Machiavelli tells us that the agents of Lorenzo de Medici, a capable prince, ran his business. The city of Florence had to pay off the debts caused by their spending. So, Lorenzo decided to stop being a merchant, which is how his family got rich in the first place, and instead used his remaining money and state funds for projects that fit his royal status.

Being a trader and a ruler seem like two very different things. The English East India Company shows this well. When they were just traders, they did well and could pay their investors a fair return. But after they became rulers and had a lot of money coming in, they ended up needing help from the government to avoid going broke. When they were traders, their workers in India saw themselves as clerks for merchants. Now, those same workers see themselves as officials for rulers.

Sometimes, a government can get some of its money from public revenue.
