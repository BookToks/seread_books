The Wealth of Nations

It's hard to expect a group of people running a company to pay close attention all the time. The East India Company, after they pay back their money and lose their special rights, can still keep going as a company and trade with the East Indies like everyone else. But in this case, a private trader who is really focused would probably get tired of the trade pretty quickly.

A well-known French writer, the Abbe Morellet, made a list of fifty-five joint-stock companies for trading with other countries that started in Europe since 1600. He says all of them failed because they were poorly managed, even though they had special rights. He got some details wrong about a few of them that weren't actually joint-stock companies and didn't fail. But there are definitely some joint-stock companies that did fail, and he didn't mention those.

The only types of businesses that seem to work well for joint-stock companies without special rights are those that can be done in a set way, with little change. These include banking, insurance for fire and sea risks, building and maintaining canals, and providing water for big cities.

Even though banking might seem complicated, it can be done by following strict rules. If a bank tries to break those rules for a chance at big profits, it can be really risky and often leads to failure. Joint-stock companies usually stick to the rules better than smaller private partnerships. Because of this, they are well-suited for banking. The main banks in Europe are joint-stock companies, and many do well without any special rights. The Bank of England only has one special rule: no other bank in England can have more than six people. The two banks in Edinburgh are also joint-stock companies without special rights.

While it's hard to figure out the exact risks from fire, sea loss, or capture, we can still make rough estimates that help us understand the situation better.
