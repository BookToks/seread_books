Adam Smith says that people don’t buy more coins than anyone else because when they get mixed with other money, it’s hard to tell them apart. Like other coins, they are worth the same amount, which is about £46:14:6. But if you melt them down, you can get a pound of gold that can be sold for between £47:14s. and £48. This gold is just as good for making coins as the original coins were. So, melting down new coins can actually make a profit, and it happens so fast that the government can’t stop it. The mint is kind of like a spider’s web; what they make during the day gets undone at night. Instead of making new coins, the mint mostly replaces the best coins that get melted down every day.

If people took their gold and silver to the mint to get coins, it would make those metals more valuable, just like how trendy items cost more. Coined gold and silver would be worth more than uncoined. If the mint's fees weren’t too high, they would add to the value of the metal. Since the government controls the minting, no coins can be sold for less than what they decide. But if the fees were too high, it could encourage people to make fake coins, which could hurt the value of the real coins. In France, even though the mint fee is eight percent, it doesn’t cause big problems. The risks of getting caught making fake coins are too high for people to take the chance for a small profit.

In France, the mint fee makes the coins worth more than just the gold in them. For example, in January 1726, the price for fine gold was set at seven hundred and forty livres nine sous and one denier for a certain weight. The gold coins in France actually contain twenty-one carats of gold.
