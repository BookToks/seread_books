The Wealth of Nations

Whether a coal mine can make money depends on a few things. For example, how good the mine is and where it’s located matter a lot.

A mine can be called good or bad based on how much mineral can be taken out with a certain amount of work. If a mine produces more than most others, it’s considered good. 

Some coal mines are in great locations but can’t be worked because they don’t produce enough coal to cover costs. If they can’t make a profit, they can’t pay rent either. 

There are also mines that just make enough to pay the workers and cover the costs of running them. These mines might give some profit to the owner, but they don’t pay rent to anyone else. Only the owner can work these mines and make money from them. In Scotland, many coal mines are worked this way, and the owners won’t let anyone else work them without paying rent, which no one can afford.

Other coal mines in Scotland are good but can’t be worked because of where they are. Even though they could produce enough coal to cover costs with normal work, they can’t sell it because they are in a remote area with no good roads or rivers for transport.

Coal is not as nice to use as wood for fuel, and some say it’s not as healthy. So, coal usually costs less where it’s used compared to wood.

The price of wood changes based on farming, similar to how cattle prices change. In the beginning, most land is covered in trees, which don’t help the owner and can be given away for free. As farming improves, some trees are cut down, and others die because there are more cattle. While cattle don’t grow as fast as crops, they do increase because people take care of them and store food for tough times. People also make sure they have more food than what nature provides.
