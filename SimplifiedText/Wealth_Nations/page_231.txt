The Wealth of Nations

When you have strong animals working on a farm, they can produce a lot more than if the land is just as good but doesn’t have the same tools and help. In factories, if you have the same number of workers but better machines, they can make way more products than with old, less effective tools.

When you spend money to improve things, like machines or buildings, you usually get back a lot more than what you spent. These improvements do need some resources, though. Some materials and workers that could have been used to make food, clothes, and homes are instead used for these improvements. Even though these changes are really helpful, they still take away from other important needs.

That’s why any upgrades in machines that let workers do the same amount of work with cheaper and simpler tools are seen as good for society. The materials and workers that used to keep complicated and expensive machines running can now be used to make more products with the new machines. For example, if a factory owner spends $1,000 a year to keep their machines running but finds a way to cut that cost to $500, they can use the extra $500 to buy more materials and hire more workers. This means they can produce more goods, which benefits everyone.

The cost of keeping machines and tools in good shape in a big country is kind of like the repairs needed on a private property. Repairs are often necessary to keep the property producing well, which helps the landlord earn money. If the costs can be lowered without hurting production, the landlord can keep making the same amount of money, or even more.

However, while the costs for maintaining machines are usually not counted in the profit of society, it’s different for the money that is constantly being used. This money is made up of cash, food, materials, and finished products. The last three are regularly taken out of circulation.
