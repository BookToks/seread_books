Adam Smith talks about how companies that are owned by many people often don't manage their business well. Just like how stewards of a rich person might ignore small details, these companies often neglect important things. Because of this, they usually struggle to compete with individual traders. They rarely succeed unless they have special rights, and even then, they often mess things up.

For example, the Royal African Company had special rights to trade, but those rights weren't officially confirmed by the government. After a big change in the country, anyone could join the trade. The Hudson's Bay Company is in a similar situation; their special rights also weren't confirmed. The South Sea Company had confirmed rights while they were still trading, just like the current company trading with the East Indies.

The Royal African Company realized they couldn't compete with individual traders, who they still called interlopers. In 1698, the government made these traders pay a 10% tax on their trade to help the company maintain their forts. Even with this tax, the company still struggled. By 1712, they were in so much debt that the government had to step in to protect both the company and its creditors. They decided that if two-thirds of the creditors agreed, it would help the company manage its debts.

By 1730, the company was in such bad shape that they couldn't even keep their forts running, which was the main reason they existed. From that year until they shut down, the government had to give them Â£10,000 each year just to help with that. By 1732, they were losing money from the trade of transporting enslaved people to the West.
