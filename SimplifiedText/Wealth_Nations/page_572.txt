Adam Smith talks about how Highlanders, who were shepherds and lived in one place, didn’t really like to follow their leader during wars. When they won something, they wanted to go home quickly, and their leader couldn’t keep them out in the field for long. They weren’t as obedient as groups like the Tartars and Arabs. Because they stayed in one place, they didn’t practice military skills as much and weren’t as good with weapons compared to those other groups.

However, if a militia fights in several battles over time, they start to act like a regular army. The soldiers get better at using their weapons and learn to follow orders quickly, just like a standing army. What they were like before doesn’t matter much. After a few battles, they become a real army. If the war in America goes on for another season, the American militia could become just as strong as the standing army, which showed bravery in the last war, matching the best soldiers from France and Spain.

This difference is important because history shows that a well-trained standing army is usually much stronger than a militia. One of the first standing armies we know about is from Philip of Macedon. He fought a lot against different groups and slowly turned his troops, which started as a militia, into a disciplined standing army. Even when he had peace, which wasn’t often, he didn’t break up his army. This army defeated the strong militias of ancient Greece and later easily took down the weaker militias of the Persian Empire. The fall of the Greek city-states and the Persian Empire shows how a standing army is way stronger than any militia. This was a major change in history that we have clear records of.
