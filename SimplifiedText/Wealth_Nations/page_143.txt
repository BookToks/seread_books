The Wealth of Nations

To make money from coal, the price needs to cover the costs of getting it to market and make a profit. In a coal mine where the owner can’t charge rent, they either have to mine it themselves or leave it alone. The price of coal usually ends up being around this cost.

When it comes to coal, the rent is usually a smaller part of the price compared to other land products. For regular land, rent is often about a third of what it produces, and it stays pretty steady regardless of how much is harvested. But in coal mines, a fifth of the total production is considered a high rent, while a tenth is more common. This rent can change a lot based on how much coal is produced. In places where land is valued at thirty times its yearly income, coal mines are often valued at just ten times.

The worth of a coal mine often depends on where it is located, while the value of a metal mine relies more on how much metal it has. Metals like gold and silver are super valuable, so they can afford to be transported over long distances. Their market isn’t just local; it’s global. For example, copper from Japan is sold in Europe, and silver from Peru is traded all the way to China.

The price of coal in one area, like Westmoreland or Shropshire, doesn’t really affect its price in another area, like Newcastle. But the prices of metals from faraway mines can influence each other. For instance, the price of copper in Japan can impact its price in Europe. Similarly, the price of silver in Peru affects its price not just in Europe but also in China. After the silver mines in Peru were discovered, many European silver mines were abandoned because the value of silver dropped so much that it wasn’t worth the cost to keep mining.
