Adam Smith talks about the job of teaching, whether in schools or privately. He believes that sharing knowledge is a more respected and useful job than writing for a publisher, especially since printing has made it easier to publish books. 

Becoming a great teacher takes just as much time, effort, and skill as becoming a top lawyer or doctor. However, teachers usually get paid a lot less than lawyers or doctors. This is because many people go into law and medicine after being trained for free by the government, while teaching has fewer people who are supported in the same way. 

Even though teachers don’t earn much, their pay would be even lower if there weren’t so many struggling writers trying to make a living. Before printing was invented, being a scholar was almost the same as being a beggar. Back then, university leaders often allowed their students to ask for money. 

In ancient times, before there were charities to help people study for professional jobs, the pay for great teachers was much better. A teacher named Isocrates criticized other teachers for promising their students a lot but only asking for a small amount of money in return. He thought that if someone was selling wisdom for such a low price, they must be foolish. 

Isocrates was serious about the pay he mentioned, which was about £13 to £16 for teaching. This means that the best teachers in Athens were usually paid at least that much. Isocrates himself charged £33 from each student and taught around a hundred students at once. This number seems normal for a big city like Athens, especially since he was teaching a popular subject called rhetoric. He must have made a good amount of money from his teaching.
