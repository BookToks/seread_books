The Wealth of Nations

The way people vote for church leaders has caused problems in many places. But in a big country like Scotland, a small issue in one area isn’t likely to upset the whole government like it would in a smaller country. A law from Queen Anne brought back the rights of patrons, who are people that can recommend someone for a church position. In Scotland, the law says that the church must give the job to whoever the patron picks. However, the church sometimes wants to check with the local community before officially giving that person the job, which is called the cure of souls. Sometimes, they wait to make sure the people agree. 

Some local clergy might try to influence this agreement, either to help or to stop it. They use their skills to sway opinions, which might keep alive some old, intense feelings among the church leaders and the people in Scotland.

In the Presbyterian church system, all clergy are supposed to be equal in authority and pay. While authority is equal, the pay isn’t always the same. However, the differences in pay aren’t usually big enough to make someone with a smaller salary grovel for a better position. In Presbyterian churches, when the rights of patrons are strong, the clergy try to earn respect through their knowledge, good behavior, and hard work instead of through flattery. Patrons sometimes complain that the clergy seem too independent, thinking it shows ingratitude for past help. But really, it might just be that they know they won’t get any more favors.

In Europe, you might not find a more educated, respectable, and independent group than the Presbyterian clergy in places like Holland, Geneva, Switzerland, and Scotland. When church salaries are similar, none of them are very high. While this might not always be ideal, it does have some good effects. A person with a small income can gain respect through their good character. On the other hand, being shallow and vain can ruin that respect.
