I won’t go back to that drunken German.”\n\nRaskolnikov tried to reason with her. \n\n“It’s unseemly to wander like this,” he said. “You’re meant to run a boarding school.”\n\n“Ha! A castle in the air!” Katerina laughed, ending in a cough. \n\n“I threw an inkpot at that general. Scoundrels! I’ll provide for the children myself!”\n\nShe turned to Sonia. \n\n“Polenka, show me what you have!”\n\n“Only two farthings,” Polenka replied.\n\n“Mean wretches!

Show you’re well brought-up!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna expresses her despair over their situation while insisting on providing for her children despite the challenges they face."
