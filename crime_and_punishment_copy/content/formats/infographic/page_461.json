Do you go often?” \n\n“N-no,” she whispered. \n\nRaskolnikov smiled faintly. \n\n“You won’t go to your father’s funeral tomorrow?” \n\n“Yes, I will. I was at church last week. A requiem service.” \n\n“For whom?” \n\n“For Lizaveta. She was killed with an axe.” \n\n“Were you friends?” \n\n“Yes. She was good. We read and talked.” \n\n“She will see God.” \n\nRaskolnikov felt dizzy. \n\n“I’ll be a religious maniac soon! It’s infectious!” \n\n“Read!” he cried, irritation creeping in. \n\nSonia’s heart raced. She hesitated, then opened the book.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov urges Sonia to read from the New Testament, revealing their shared connection to faith and loss."
