We need to talk,” Pulcheria replied. \n\n“Breakfast?” she asked, inviting him to join. \n\nAvdotya rang for tea. \n\nA ragged waiter brought it, messy and disordered. \n\nPulcheria blushed with embarrassment. \n\nRazumihin hesitated, thinking of Luzhin. \n\nQuestions flowed from Pulcheria, easing his discomfort. \n\nHe talked for three quarters of an hour.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin visits the ladies at Bakaleyev's house, where he is met with unexpected gratitude and a desire to discuss important matters."
