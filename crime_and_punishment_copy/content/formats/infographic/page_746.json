  "text": "He hid the trinkets and purse under a stone. \n\nRodion Raskolnikov couldn’t remember the trinkets. \n\nHe never opened the purse. \n\n\"How much is in it?\" he thought. \n\nThree hundred and seventeen roubles and sixty copecks. \n\nSome notes were damp from lying there too long. \n\nLawyers debated his truthfulness. \n\n\"Why lie about this?\" they asked. \n\n\"Maybe he didn’t look,\" one suggested. \n\nThey spoke of temporary insanity. \n\nWitnesses confirmed his strange behavior. \n\nRaskolnikov said little in his defense. \n\n\"What was your motive?\" they pressed. \n\nHe remained silent, lost in thought.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's confession and the circumstances of his crime suggest a complex interplay of mental derangement and poverty rather than straightforward criminal intent."
