He ate greedily, feeling calmer. \n\nThe door creaked open. \n\n“Ah, he’s eating,” Razumihin said, taking a seat. \n\nWorry etched on his face, he spoke quietly. \n\n“Are you alright?” \n\nRaskolnikov nodded, but doubt lingered in the air.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a mix of unease and relief as he grapples with his conscience and the impending funeral of Katerina Ivanovna."
