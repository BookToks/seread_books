  "text": "Svidrigaïlov studied Raskolnikov closely. \n\n“Interesting, isn’t it?” he said, a smirk in his eyes. \n\n“Marfa Petrovna told Avdotya Romanovna about me. \n\nI might seem romantic to some. \n\nShe felt pity for me, a lost soul. \n\nWhen a girl’s heart is moved to pity, it’s dangerous. \n\nShe wants to save him, to lift him up. \n\nI saw her flying into her own cage. \n\n“Do you frown, Rodion Romanovitch?” \n\n“Don’t worry. It all ended in smoke.” \n\nHe sighed, taking another drink. \n\n“I wish Avdotya had lived in the second century. \n\nShe would have smiled through her martyrdom.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov reflects on the dangerous allure of pity and the potential for manipulation in relationships, particularly regarding Avdotya Romanovna."
