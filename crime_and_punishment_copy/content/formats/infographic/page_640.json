It’s better for both of us.”  \nRaskolnikov thought.  \n“Maybe you’re mistaken.”  \n“No, I have a fact.”  \n“What fact?”  \n“I can’t tell you. I must arrest you.”  \nRaskolnikov smirked.  \n“That’s shameless. Why confess if prison is safer?”  \n“Don’t trust my words. Prison may not be restful.”  \n“Are you hiding something?”  \nPorfiry smiled knowingly.  \n“Perhaps.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry Petrovitch proposes that Raskolnikov should confess to benefit both of them, despite Raskolnikov's skepticism about the necessity of a confession."
