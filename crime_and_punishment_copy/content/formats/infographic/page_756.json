Thin cabbage soup with beetles. \n\nHe had endured worse as a student. \n\nHis clothes were warm enough. \n\nHe barely felt the fetters. \n\nBut shame gnawed at him. \n\nNot for his shaven head or patched coat. \n\nNot before Sonia, who feared him. \n\nYet he tortured her with contempt. \n\nHis pride was wounded. \n\nHe longed to blame himself. \n\nShame and disgrace would be bearable. \n\nBut his conscience judged him harshly. \n\nHe found no terrible fault. \n\nJust a simple blunder. \n\nBlind fate had brought him low. \n\nHe must now humble himself.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's illness stems not from the hardships of prison life, but from his wounded pride and inability to accept his fate."
