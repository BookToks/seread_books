You ought to be killed!” \n\nHe remained silent. \n\nA prisoner lunged at him. \n\nRaskolnikov stood still, unflinching. \n\nThe guard intervened just in time. \n\nWhy did they love Sonia? \n\nShe rarely visited. \n\nYet they all knew her. \n\nShe had sent them pies at Christmas. \n\nConnections grew, simple and strong.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels isolated and despised by fellow prisoners, contrasting their love for life with his own turmoil, while Sonia earns their affection despite her minimal interactions."
