  "text": "Raskolnikov stopped at each landing, curiosity pulsing through him. \n\nHe paused on the first landing. The window framework was gone. \n\n“Not like this before,” he thought. \n\nOn the second floor, he saw the flat was shut and newly painted. \n\nHe moved to the third and fourth floors. \n\n“Here!” \n\nThe door stood wide open. Voices echoed inside. \n\nHe hesitated, then climbed the last stairs. \n\nInside, workmen bustled about. \n\nBare walls stared back at him. \n\nHe sat on the window-sill, feeling oddly out of place. \n\nTwo young workmen papered the walls with lilac flowers. \n\nHe frowned at the change. \n\n“Why are you preening?” the elder asked the younger. \n\n“I’m ready to do anything to please you, Tit Vassilitch!” \n\nRaskolnikov listened, feeling a strange annoyance.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is disturbed to find the flat he once knew being renovated and occupied by workmen, contrasting his memories of the past."
