They passed on, leaving him feeling like a beggar. \n\nHe closed his hand around the coins and walked ten paces. \n\nThe Neva sparkled under a cloudless sky. \n\nHe turned to the palace, the cathedral gleaming in sunlight. \n\nPain from the lash faded. \n\nA familiar unease filled him. \n\nHe stood still, gazing into the distance. \n\nMemories of university days flooded back. \n\nEach time, he marveled at the spectacle, yet felt cold inside. \n\nHe mistrusted himself, postponing the search for answers.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov receives a small donation from a woman, prompting him to reflect on his past feelings of detachment and the beauty of his surroundings."
