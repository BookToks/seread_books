When she looked like she wanted to back away in fear, he felt a sharp pang inside him.\n\n“I didn’t expect to see you,” he said quickly, giving her a look that made her freeze. “Please, sit down. You must have come from Katerina Ivanovna. Not there. Sit here…”\n\nRazumihin, who had been lounging on one of Raskolnikov’s three chairs near the door, stood up to let her in. Raskolnikov initially pointed to the spot on the sofa where Zossimov had been, but then realized that the sofa was too personal, so he quickly gestured for her to take Razumihin’s chair instead.\n\n“You sit here,” he told Razumihin, nudging him toward the sofa.\n\nSonia sat down, visibly trembling, and glanced nervously at the two ladies. It was clear she couldn’t believe she was actually sitting next to them. The thought made her so anxious that she jumped up again and, in a fluster, turned to Raskolnikov.\n\n“I… I… just came for a minute. Sorry to disturb you,” she stammered. “I’m from Katerina Ivanovna, and she didn’t have anyone else to send. She wanted me to ask you… to be at the service… in the morning… at Mitrofanievsky… and then… to come to us… to her… to honor her… she told me to ask you…” Sonia trailed off, lost for words.\n\n“I’ll try, of course, definitely,” Raskolnikov replied. He stood up too, but he was at a loss for words as well.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels a sudden pang of sympathy for Sonia, who appears humiliated and terrified as she seeks his presence on behalf of Katerina Ivanovna."
