  "text": "Raskolnikov noticed something important: Porfiry Petrovitch wasn’t flustered. In fact, Raskolnikov felt like he might have walked into a trap. Something was off, and he sensed that Porfiry had everything ready to spring on him at any moment.\n\nHe stood up, grabbed his cap, and got straight to the point. “Porfiry Petrovitch,” he said, trying to keep his cool despite feeling irritated, “yesterday you wanted me to come by for some inquiries” (he emphasized “inquiries” like it was a big deal). “I’m here now. If you have questions, ask them. If not, let me go. I’m busy… I need to get to the funeral of that guy who got run over, the one you know about,” he added, instantly regretting it and feeling even angrier. “I’m done with all this, got it? It’s part of why I’m feeling sick. So, either ask me what you need to or let me leave. And if you’re going to question me, do it properly! Otherwise, I’m out of here.”\n\n“What do you mean? What should I even ask you?” Porfiry Petrovitch replied, his tone shifting as he stopped laughing. “Don’t stress yourself,” he said, moving around nervously and trying to get Raskolnikov to sit down again. “There’s no rush, really.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels trapped and irritated during a tense encounter with Porfiry Petrovitch, who seems to have ulterior motives for their meeting."
