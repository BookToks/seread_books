I’ve wronged you.”\n\n“So you come from that house?”\n\n“I was standing at the gate with them… don’t you remember? We’ve worked in that house for years. We cure and prepare hides, take work home… mostly, I was just really upset…”\n\nSuddenly, the whole scene from two days ago flashed in Raskolnikov’s mind.

He recalled one voice suggesting they take him straight to the police station.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov encounters a man who admits to feeling guilty for having evil thoughts about him."
