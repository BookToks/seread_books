You think I’m weird?”  \n“Yeah, kinda weird.”  \n“Wanna know what I was reading? Look at all these papers I had them bring me. Suspicious, right?”  \n“Well, what’s up?”  \n“Are you listening closely?”  \n“What do you mean—‘listening closely’?”  \n“I’ll explain later, but right now, my dude, I swear… no, wait, I confess… no, that’s not it; let’s say I’m making a statement, and you’re taking notes. I was reading, searching….” He squinted and paused. “I was searching—and I came here on purpose—to find news about the old pawnbroker’s murder,” he finally said, almost whispering, leaning in close to Zametov. Zametov stared back, not flinching or pulling away. What struck Zametov as odd later was that they stayed silent for a whole minute, just staring at each other.  \n“So what if you’ve been reading about it?” he finally snapped, confused and annoyed. “That’s not my problem! What’s it to me?”  \n“It’s about that same old woman,” Raskolnikov continued in the same whisper, ignoring Zametov’s irritation. “The one you were talking about at the police station when I fainted. Get it now?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confesses to Zametov that he has been searching for news about the murder of the old pawnbroker woman."
