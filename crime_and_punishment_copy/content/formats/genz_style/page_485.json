Raskolnikov stood up from the sofa, abruptly cutting off his hysterical giggles.\n\n“Porfiry Petrovitch,” he said, his voice loud and clear, even though his legs shook and he could barely stand. “I see it now. You actually think I killed that old woman and her sister Lizaveta. Let me be real with you: I’m done with this. If you think you can legally go after me, then do it. Arrest me. But I won’t let you mock me to my face and keep bothering me…”\n\nHis lips quivered, eyes blazing with anger, and he couldn't hold back his voice. \n\n“I won’t allow it!” he shouted, slamming his fist on the table. “Do you hear me, Porfiry Petrovitch? I won’t allow it.”\n\n“What on earth?!” Porfiry exclaimed, looking genuinely scared. “Rodion Romanovitch, what’s wrong with you?”\n\n“I won’t allow it,” Raskolnikov shouted again.\n\n“Shh! They’ll hear us!” Porfiry whispered, panic in his voice, leaning in close. “What would we even say to them?”\n\n“I won’t allow it, I won’t allow it,” Raskolnikov repeated, almost mechanically, but his tone turned into a whisper too.\n\nPorfiry quickly turned and rushed to open the window. “Let’s get some fresh air! And you need some water, my friend.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confronts Porfiry, expressing his frustration over being suspected of murder and demanding to be prosecuted if that is the case."
