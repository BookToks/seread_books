  "text": "Luzhin spotted me and pulled me to the window, asking quietly if I’d seen you at Katerina Ivanovna’s gathering. It was super important for him that you were there! That’s the deal!\n\nLuzhin smirked, but he looked pale. He seemed to be thinking about how to get out of this mess. He probably wished he could just bail, but that wasn’t really an option now. Admitting the truth behind the accusations would be a big deal. Plus, the crowd was already hyped up from drinking, and they weren’t about to let him off easy. The commissariat clerk, who didn’t fully get what was going on, was yelling louder than anyone and throwing out some nasty suggestions aimed at Luzhin.\n\nNot everyone was drunk, though; lodgers were coming in from all over. The three Poles were super fired up, shouting, “The pan is a lajdak!” and muttering threats in Polish. Sonia was listening closely, but she seemed a bit dazed, like she was just waking up. Her eyes were glued to Raskolnikov, knowing he was her only hope. Katerina Ivanovna was breathing heavily and looked completely worn out. Amalia Ivanovna stood there, looking confused and clueless, with her mouth hanging open, not sure what had just gone down. All she knew was that Pyotr Petrovitch was in deep trouble.\n\nRaskolnikov tried to speak again, but the crowd wouldn’t let him. Everyone was surrounding Luzhin, hurling threats and insults. But Pyotr Petrovitch was not backing down.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Luzhin, cornered and pale, faces accusations and hostility from the crowd, while Raskolnikov struggles to intervene."
