  "text": "This uncle of mine is a decent guy with a thousand roubles (money) saved up. He lives off his pension and doesn’t really need that cash. For the past two years, he’s been bugging me to borrow it and pay him six percent interest. I get it—he just wants to help. Last year, I didn’t need it, but this year, I’ve decided to take him up on it as soon as he gets here. \n\nThen I’ll borrow another thousand from you, and we’ll have enough to kick things off. So, what’s the plan? \n\nRazumihin then laid out his idea. He explained that most publishers and booksellers have no clue about what they’re selling, which makes them pretty terrible at their jobs. The truth is, good publications usually turn a profit—sometimes a big one. Razumihin had been dreaming of starting his own publishing business. He’s been working in publishing for two years and speaks three European languages pretty well, even though he told Raskolnikov just six days ago that he was “schwach” (weak) in German to convince him to share a translation job (and the payment). He was totally lying, and Raskolnikov knew it. \n\n“Why should we let this chance slip away when we’ve got our own money to invest?” Razumihin exclaimed with passion. “Sure, it’ll be a lot of work, but we’ll make it happen— you, Avdotya Romanovna, me, Rodion… We can score some serious profits with the right books! The best part is, we’ll know exactly what we’re doing.” 📚✨\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin proposes a publishing partnership, leveraging borrowed money to capitalize on the potential profitability of the book market."
