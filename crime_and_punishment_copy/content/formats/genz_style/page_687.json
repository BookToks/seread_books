He probably thought he was being all gentlemanly! Honestly, I wouldn’t have believed it either if I hadn’t heard it myself, but I trust my ears. He laid it all out for Sofya Semyonovna too. At first, she couldn’t believe it, but she eventually saw the truth with her own eyes.”\n\n“What were the reasons?”\n\n“It’s a long story, Avdotya Romanovna. Let me break it down. It’s like a theory I have: one bad deed is okay if it leads to something good. Just one mistake for hundreds of good things! It’s frustrating for a talented young guy with a big ego to realize that if he just had a measly three thousand, his whole life would look different, but he doesn’t have it. Plus, he’s stressed from being hungry, living in a dump, and wearing rags, all while feeling the weight of his family’s struggles. And let’s not forget the vanity and pride—though he might have some good traits too. I’m not judging him, don’t get me wrong; it’s not my place. \n\nThen there’s this little theory he has—dividing people into two groups: the material and the superior. The superior ones think the rules don’t apply to them because they’re better, and they make the laws for everyone else. It sounds good in theory, but…”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The conversation explores the justification of wrongdoing through a theory that posits some individuals are superior and above the law, leading to moral dilemmas and justifications for their actions."
