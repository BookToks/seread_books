  "text": "Dounia can handle a lot, that’s for sure. If she can deal with Mr. Svidrigaïlov and all his drama, she can definitely handle Mr. Luzhin. This guy thinks wives from tough backgrounds owe everything to their husbands—he even brings this up right away. Sure, he might say it casually, but he’s smart enough to know what he’s doing. \n\nDounia gets him, but living with him? No way! She’d rather eat black bread and water than sell her soul for comfort. Not even for all the riches in Schleswig-Holstein, and definitely not for Luzhin’s cash. That’s just not who she is. \n\nYeah, the Svidrigaïlovs are a tough pill to swallow. Being a governess in the provinces for just two hundred roubles is rough, but she’d rather be a servant somewhere else than lose her dignity by tying herself to a man she doesn’t respect. \n\nEven if Luzhin were pure gold or a giant diamond, she wouldn’t agree to be his legal partner. So why is she even considering it? The answer is simple: for herself, she wouldn’t sell out. But for someone else? That’s a different story.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia refuses to sacrifice her moral freedom for personal comfort, yet considers compromising her values for the sake of her loved ones."
