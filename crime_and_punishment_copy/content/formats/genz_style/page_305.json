Sorry, I still don’t know your name!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna jumped in.\n\n“Dmitri Prokofitch.”\n\n“I really want to know, Dmitri Prokofitch… what’s his vibe like now? What does he like or dislike? Is he always this irritable? Can you share his hopes and dreams? What’s influencing him these days? In short, I want to know everything…”\n\n“Mom, how can he answer all that at once?” Dounia chimed in.\n\n“Goodness, I didn’t expect him to be like this, Dmitri Prokofitch!” \n\n“Of course,” Razumihin replied. “I don’t have a mom, but my uncle visits every year, and he barely recognizes me, even though he’s smart.

I’ve known Rodion for a year and a half; he’s pretty dark, gloomy, and full of pride.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin describes Raskolnikov's character as morose, gloomy, proud, and haughty, while Pulcheria Alexandrovna expresses her eagerness to understand her son's current state."
