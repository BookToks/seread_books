  "text": "Raskolnikov heard heavy footsteps on the stairs. Then silence. \n\n“What now?” he thought. He unhooked the door and opened it—no one was around. Without thinking, he slipped out and headed downstairs. \n\nAfter three flights, he heard a loud shout from below. Panic hit him. Where could he hide? He turned back toward his flat. \n\n“Hey! Catch that guy!” \n\nA guy burst out of a flat below, yelling and stumbling down the stairs. \n\n“Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Blast him!” \n\nHis shout ended in a scream, and then everything went quiet. But just then, a group of men started climbing the stairs, chatting loudly. Raskolnikov recognized the voice of the young man. “They!” \n\nHe felt a wave of despair. If they stopped him, it was over. If they let him go, that was bad too; they’d remember him. They were getting closer, just a flight away. \n\nThen, suddenly, he spotted hope! A door to an empty flat on the right stood wide open. The painters must’ve just left it. It was like a lifeline thrown to him.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, filled with despair, faces a critical moment of potential discovery as he navigates a tense situation in the stairwell."
