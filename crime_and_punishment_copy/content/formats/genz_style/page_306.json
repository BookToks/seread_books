  "text": "Raskolnikov has been acting super suspicious lately—maybe for a long time. He’s got a good heart but hates showing it. Sometimes, he’s just cold and distant, like he’s switching between two different people. He can be really closed off! He claims he’s too busy for anything, yet he just lies in bed doing nothing. He doesn’t mock things, not because he can’t, but because he thinks it’s a waste of time. He barely listens to anyone and doesn’t care about what others find exciting. He has a high opinion of himself, and maybe he’s right about that. So, what else? I really think your visit will help him a lot. 🙏\n\n“Let’s hope so,” said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, worried about her son Rodya.\n\nRazumihin finally mustered the courage to look at Avdotya Romanovna more directly. He glanced at her often while talking but quickly looked away. Avdotya was at the table, listening closely, then started pacing with her arms crossed, lips pressed together, occasionally asking questions while walking. She had a habit of tuning out what was said too. She wore a simple dark dress and a white scarf around her neck. Razumihin quickly noticed signs of their extreme poverty. If Avdotya had been dressed like royalty, he thought it would have felt different.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov exhibits a complex personality, alternating between noble kindness and cold callousness, while his family hopes for a positive change with the arrival of a visitor."
