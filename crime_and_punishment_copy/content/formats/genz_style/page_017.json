  "text": "Raskolnikov snapped back to reality as he found himself in the next street. He looked around and noticed a tavern with steps leading down to the basement. Just then, two drunk guys stumbled out, yelling and leaning on each other as they climbed the steps. Without thinking, Raskolnikov headed down the steps. He had never been to a tavern before, but now he felt dizzy and super thirsty. He craved a cold beer, thinking his weakness was just from being hungry.\n\nHe plopped down at a sticky little table in a dark corner, ordered some beer, and gulped down the first glass. Instantly, he felt better, and his thoughts started to clear up. \n\n“All that’s nonsense,” he said to himself, feeling hopeful. “Nothing to stress over! Just a little beer and some dry bread—and boom, my brain feels sharper, my mind clearer, and my will stronger! Phew, this is all so trivial!”\n\nDespite his dismissive thoughts, he felt surprisingly cheerful, like a weight had been lifted off his shoulders. He glanced around at the other people in the tavern with a friendly vibe. But deep down, he sensed that this sudden happiness wasn’t quite right. \n\nThe tavern was pretty empty. Besides the two drunks he’d seen earlier, a small group of five guys and a girl with a concertina had just left, leaving the place quiet and a bit lonely.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, feeling giddy and tormented by thirst, enters a tavern for the first time, seeking relief through beer, which temporarily clears his mind but also raises concerns about his mental state."
