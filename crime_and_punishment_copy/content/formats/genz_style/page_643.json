If you’d gone with another theory, you could’ve done something way worse. You might want to thank God for that. Who knows? Maybe God has a plan for you. But keep your chin up and don’t be scared! Are you worried about facing the consequences? You shouldn’t be. After making such a choice, you need to toughen up. There’s a sense of justice in this. I know you might not believe it, but life will help you get through this. You’ll move on in time. What you really need now is fresh air—lots of it!\n\nRaskolnikov jumped a bit. \n\n“Who are you?
