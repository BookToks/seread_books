A minute later, Lebeziatnikov appeared at the door, just standing there, listening with keen interest and a bit of confusion.\n\n“Sorry to interrupt, but this is important,” Pyotr Petrovitch said, addressing everyone in the room. “Amalia Ivanovna, as the lady of the house, please pay attention to what I’m about to say to Sofya Ivanovna.” He turned to Sonia, who looked shocked and anxious. “Right after your visit, I noticed a hundred-rouble note went missing from my table in Mr. Lebeziatnikov’s room. If you know where it is, please tell us. I promise, on my word, that this will end here. If not, I’ll have to take serious action, and then it’ll be on you.”\n\nThe room fell silent. Even the crying kids stopped. Sonia went pale, staring at Luzhin, unable to speak. She seemed lost. Seconds ticked by.\n\n“Well, what’s it going to be?” Luzhin asked, staring intently at her.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pyotr Petrovitch accuses Sonia of stealing a hundred-rouble note, threatening serious consequences if she does not confess."
