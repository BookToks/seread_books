  "text": "Dmitri stayed in the house for about ten minutes before heading out again. He didn’t see Nikolay after that and finished the job solo. Their job was on the same staircase as the murder, on the second floor. When I heard Dushkin’s story, I kept quiet but couldn’t shake my suspicions. \n\nThis morning—three days later, just so you know—I saw Nikolay come in. He wasn’t totally sober but could still hold a conversation. He plopped down on a bench and didn’t say a word. There was only one random guy in the bar, a man I knew snoozing on another bench, and our two boys. \n\nI asked Nikolay, “Have you seen Dmitri?” He said no. “And you haven’t been here either?” He replied, “Not since the day before yesterday.” Then I asked, “Where did you sleep last night?” He said he crashed in Peski with the Kolomensky guys. \n\nCurious, I asked about the earrings he had. “Found them in the street,” he said, but he looked super sketchy and wouldn’t make eye contact. I pressed, “Did you hear about what went down that night on that staircase?” He said no, but his face went pale and his eyes got wide. I told him everything, and he started to get up. \n\n“Hold on, Nikolay,” I said. “Want a drink?” I signaled the boy to block the door, but he bolted out and ran down the street. I haven’t seen him since. That sealed it for me—he was involved, no doubt about it. 🤔 \n\n“I’d say so,” Zossimov chimed in.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dushkin recounts his suspicions about Nikolay's involvement in a murder after observing his strange behavior and evasive answers."
