  "text": "Yesterday, someone told me that all a guy really needs is fresh air. I’m gonna talk to him soon to see what he really means by that. \n\nRazumihin was deep in thought, piecing things together. “He’s a political conspirator! He’s definitely planning something big. And Dounia knows it,” he suddenly realized. \n\n“So, Avdotya Romanovna comes to see you, and now you’re off to meet a guy who says we need more air. That letter she got must be connected too,” he thought.\n\n“What letter?” \n\n“She got a letter today. It really shook her up—like, a lot. I mentioned you, and she asked me to drop it. Then she said we might have to part ways soon. She thanked me for something, then went to her room and locked the door.”\n\n“She got a letter?” Raskolnikov asked, lost in thought.\n\n“Yeah, didn’t you know? Hmm…” \n\nThey fell silent. \n\n“Goodbye, Rodion. There was a time when I… Never mind, goodbye. I must go too. No drinking tonight; that’s just nonsense!” \n\nHe rushed out but paused at the door, almost closing it.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin suspects that Raskolnikov is involved in a political conspiracy and is troubled by a letter that has upset Dounia."
