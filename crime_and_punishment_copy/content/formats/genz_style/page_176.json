  "text": "“Hey, Raskolnikov,” Razumihin started, “if you’re up for it, I’ve got thirty-five roubles for you. Semyon Semyonovitch got the cash from Afanasy Ivanovitch at your mom’s request, just like before. You know him?” \n\n“Yeah, I remember… Vahrushin,” Raskolnikov replied, lost in thought. \n\n“See? He knows Vahrushin!” Razumihin exclaimed. “He’s in ‘an intelligible condition’! You’re clearly sharp too. Always nice to hear some wisdom.” \n\n“That’s the guy, Vahrushin. Your mom sent you money like this before, and he did it again, hoping for better things to come.” \n\n“‘Hoping for better things’—now that’s the best thing you’ve said! And ‘your mom’ isn’t bad either. So, what’s the deal? Is he fully conscious?” \n\n“Yeah, it’s all good. He just needs to sign this paper.” \n\n“He can scribble his name. Do you have the book?” \n\n“Yep, here it is.” \n\n“Hand it over. Rodya, sit up. I’ll support you. Grab the pen and write ‘Raskolnikov’ for him. Right now, brother, money is sweeter than candy.” 🍬 \n\n“I don’t want it,” Raskolnikov said, pushing the pen away. \n\n“Not want it?” \n\n“I won’t sign it.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov refuses to sign for a remittance of thirty-five roubles sent by his mother, indicating his disconnection from his circumstances."
