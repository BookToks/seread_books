  "text": "Raskolnikov stayed quiet, staring hard at Porfiry. Razumihin looked upset, like he was catching on to something. The vibe was tense. Raskolnikov decided it was time to leave.\n\n“Are you leaving already?” Porfiry asked, way too friendly. He reached out his hand, all polite. “Really glad to meet you. About your request, don’t worry. Just write what I said, or better yet, come see me in a day or two… tomorrow, actually. I’ll be there at eleven for sure. We’ll sort everything out and have a chat. Since you’re one of the last to be here, you might have something to share,” he added, wearing a big smile.\n\n“You want to grill me officially?” Raskolnikov shot back, sharp.\n\n“Oh, no need for that right now. You’re misunderstanding me. I take every chance I get, you know. I’ve talked to everyone with pledges… got some info from them, and you’re the last one,” he said, suddenly brightening up. “By the way,” he turned to Razumihin, “you were going on about that Nikolay… I know, I know he’s innocent, but what can we do? We had to bother Dmitri too… Anyway, the key point is, when you went up the stairs, it was past seven, right?”\n\n“Yeah,” Raskolnikov replied, feeling uneasy.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov engages in a tense conversation with Porfiry, who hints at his suspicions while maintaining a facade of politeness."
