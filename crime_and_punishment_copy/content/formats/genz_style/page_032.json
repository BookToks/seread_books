  "text": "Marmeladov was in the tavern, totally ignoring the new people coming in. He looked weak, but as he drank more, he got chatty. Remembering his recent job success seemed to give him a little spark. Raskolnikov was all ears. \n\n\"That was five weeks ago,\" he said. \"When Katerina Ivanovna and Sonia heard about it, it was like I stepped into Heaven. Before, it was all insults and chaos. Now? They were tiptoeing around, keeping the kids quiet. 'Semyon Zakharovitch is tired from work, shh!' They even made me coffee before I went to work and boiled cream—real cream! Can you believe that? \n\nAnd somehow, they scraped together money for a decent outfit—eleven roubles and fifty copecks. I got boots, a cotton shirt-front—everything looked amazing for that price. The first morning after I started working, I came home to find Katerina Ivanovna had cooked a full dinner—soup and salt meat with horseradish. We’d never had that before! She didn’t have any nice clothes, but she dressed up like she was going out. She did her hair, put on a clean collar and cuffs, and suddenly she looked younger and way better.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marmeladov recounts how his recent job success transformed his family's treatment of him, leading to a brief period of care and attention from Katerina Ivanovna and Sonia."
