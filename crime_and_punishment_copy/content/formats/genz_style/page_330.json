You said this yesterday.”\n\n“Brother,” Dounia replied, steady and dry. “You’re misunderstanding things. I thought it over last night and figured it out. You think I’m sacrificing myself for someone else. That’s not it at all. I’m marrying for me because life is tough. Sure, I’d be happy to help the family, but that’s not the main reason.”\n\n“He’s thinking, ‘She’s lying,’ biting his nails in frustration. ‘Such pride! She won’t admit she wants to help out of kindness! Too stuck up! Ugh, I hate them all!’”\n\n“Honestly,” Dounia continued, “I’m marrying Pyotr Petrovitch because I’m choosing the lesser of two evils. I plan to do everything he expects from me, so I’m not deceiving him… Why did you smile just now?” She flushed, anger flashing in her eyes.\n\n“All?” he asked, smirking.\n\n“Within limits. The way Pyotr Petrovitch courts me made it clear what he wants. He might think too highly of himself, but I hope he respects me too… Why are you laughing again?”\n\n“And why are you blushing again? You’re lying, sister.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia asserts that she is marrying for her own sake rather than out of sacrifice or charity, despite her brother's accusations."
