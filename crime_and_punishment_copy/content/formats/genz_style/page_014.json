  "text": "Raskolnikov noticed how clean everything was and peeked at the cotton curtain covering the door to the old woman's other tiny room, where her bed and chest of drawers were. This was the whole flat. \n\n“What do you want?” the old woman asked sharply, stepping into the room and staring him down.\n\n“I’ve got something to pawn,” he replied, pulling out an old silver watch with a globe engraved on the back. The chain was steel.\n\n“But your last pledge is overdue. It was due the day before yesterday.”\n\n“I’ll bring you the interest for another month. Just wait a bit.”\n\n“That's my choice, not yours. I can wait or sell your stuff right now.”\n\n“How much for the watch, Alyona Ivanovna?” \n\n“You come with these little things. It’s hardly worth anything. I gave you two roubles for your ring, and you could buy it new for a rouble and a half.”\n\n“Give me four roubles for it. I’ll redeem it; it was my dad’s. I’ll have money soon.”\n\n“A rouble and a half, plus interest in advance, if you want!” \n\n“A rouble and a half?” he exclaimed, frustrated. \n\n“Suit yourself,” she said, handing the watch back. He took it, fuming.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov attempts to pawn a silver watch but is met with the old woman's harsh refusal and undervaluation of his item."
