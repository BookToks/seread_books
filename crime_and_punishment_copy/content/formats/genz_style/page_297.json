  "text": "\"It wonâ€™t be a hassle, trust me. Just chat with herâ€”talk about anything, really, as long as youâ€™re there. Youâ€™re a doctor, right? Try to help her with something. Seriously, you wonâ€™t regret it. She has a piano, and I mess around on it a bit. Iâ€™ve got this song, a real Russian classic: â€˜I shed hot tears.â€™ Sheâ€™s into the real deal, and it all kicked off with that song. Now youâ€™re like a pro, a total maestro. You wonâ€™t regret it! ðŸŽ¹\n\nâ€˜But did you promise her anything? Like a marriage thing?â€™  \nâ€˜Nope, nothing like that! Besides, sheâ€™s not that type. Tchebarov tried thatâ€¦â€™  \nâ€˜Then just forget her!â€™  \nâ€˜I canâ€™t just drop her!â€™  \nâ€˜Why not?â€™  \nâ€˜I just canâ€™t, okay? Thereâ€™s something pulling me in.â€™  \nâ€˜Then why are you even into her?â€™  \nâ€˜Iâ€™m not the one whoâ€™s enchanted; maybe I got caught up in my own mess. But she doesnâ€™t care if itâ€™s you or me, as long as someoneâ€™s there, sighing awayâ€¦ I canâ€™t explain it, man. Youâ€™re good at math, right? Why not teach her integral calculus? Seriously, Iâ€™m not joking. Sheâ€™ll stare at you and sigh for a whole year. I once talked to her for two days about the Prussian House of Lords (had to talk about something)â€”she just sighed and sweated! And donâ€™t mention loveâ€”she gets super shy about it. ðŸ˜³\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin encourages Raskolnikov to engage with a woman by simply being present and talking to her, suggesting that emotional connection can develop without the need for promises or declarations of love."
