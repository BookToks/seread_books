  "text": "You’ve made this super easy for me, Avdotya Romanovna. But where’d you get the revolver? Was it from Mr. Razumihin? Wait, that’s my revolver! I’ve been searching for it everywhere. Those shooting lessons I gave you in the country really paid off. \n\n“It’s not yours. It belonged to Marfa Petrovna, the woman you killed! There was nothing of yours in her place. I took it when I started to realize what you could do. If you take one step closer, I swear I’ll shoot.” She was losing it. \n\n“But what about your brother? Just curious,” Svidrigaïlov said, still not moving. \n\n“Go ahead and tell! Don’t move! I’ll shoot! I know you poisoned your wife; you’re a murderer!” She aimed the revolver. \n\n“Are you sure I poisoned Marfa Petrovna?” \n\n“You did! You hinted at it yourself; you talked about poison. I know you went to get it… you had it ready. It was your doing. Scoundrel!” \n\n“Even if that’s true, it was for your sake… you would’ve caused it.” \n\n“You’re lying! I’ve always hated you!” \n\n“Oho, Avdotya Romanovna! You seem to forget how you softened up to me during all that propaganda. I saw it in your eyes. Remember that moonlit night when the nightingale was singing?” \n\n“That’s a lie,” Dounia shot back, fury flashing in her eyes. “That’s a lie and a slander!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia confronts Svidrigaïlov with a revolver, accusing him of murder and refusing to let him approach her."
