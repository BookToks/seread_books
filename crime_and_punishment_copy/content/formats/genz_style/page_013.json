The setting sun lit everything up nicely. \n\n‘So the sun shines like this too!’ he thought, quickly scanning the room to remember how it looked. But there wasn’t much to see. The furniture was old and yellow wood: a sofa with a big, curved back, an oval table in front of it, a dressing table with a mirror between the windows, some chairs along the walls, and a few cheap prints in yellow frames showing German girls with birds. That was about it. \n\nIn one corner, a light flickered in front of a small ikon (a religious image). Everything was spotless; the floor and furniture gleamed. \n\n‘Lizaveta must have cleaned,’ he thought. There wasn’t a speck of dust anywhere. \n\n‘You find the cleanest places in the homes of cranky old widows,’ he mused.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov visits an old woman to pawn something, feeling uneasy about her mistrust and observing the cleanliness of her modest flat."
