  "text": "In the courtyard, Sonia turned right. “Bah!” muttered the stranger, following her up the stairs. Only then did she notice him. When she reached the third floor, she turned down the hall and rang the bell at No. 9. The door had “Kapernaumov, Tailor” written in chalk. “Bah!” the stranger said again, surprised by the coincidence, and he rang the bell next door at No. 8. The doors were close—just a couple of yards apart.\n\n“You live at Kapernaumov’s,” he said, laughing as he looked at Sonia. “He fixed a waistcoat for me yesterday. I’m staying nearby at Madame Resslich’s. How strange!” Sonia studied him closely.\n\n“We’re neighbors!” he continued cheerfully. “I just got to town two days ago. See you later!” Sonia didn’t respond; she quickly slipped inside her apartment, feeling oddly ashamed and uneasy.\n\n*****\n\nOn the way to Porfiry’s, Razumihin was clearly pumped up. \n\n“That’s great, brother!” he said over and over. “I’m so glad! So glad!” \n\n“What’s he so happy about?” Raskolnikov wondered.\n\n“I didn’t know you were pawning stuff at the old woman’s too. How long ago was that? Were you there recently?” \n\n“What a naive guy!” Raskolnikov thought.\n\n“When was it?” he paused to think. “Must’ve been two or three days before she died.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia encounters a stranger who reveals they are neighbors, leading her to feel uneasy."
