What’s the rush? Got a date or something? We’ve got all the time in the world. I’ve been waiting around for you for three hours. I checked on you twice, and you were knocked out both times. I also tried to reach Zossimov, but he’s not home. No biggie, he’ll show up. Plus, I was out handling my own stuff today. You know, moving in with my uncle now. But let’s get to it. Hand me that parcel, Nastasya. We’ll open it up right away. How are you feeling now, brother?”  \n“I’m good, really. Not sick. Razumihin, how long have you been here?”  \n“I told you, I’ve been waiting for three hours!”  \n“No, I mean before that.”  \n“Before? I explained everything this morning. Don’t you remember?”  \nRaskolnikov thought for a moment. The morning felt like a blur. He looked at Razumihin, confused.  \n“Hmm,” Razumihin said, “you’ve forgotten. I thought you weren’t quite yourself. But hey, you look way better now. Seriously, first-rate! Now, let’s get down to business.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov wakes up from a long sleep to find Razumihin waiting for him and discussing their plans."
