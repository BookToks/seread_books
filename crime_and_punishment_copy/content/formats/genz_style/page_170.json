  "text": "The noise from the fighting, crying, and swearing got louder and louder. To his shock, Raskolnikov recognized his landlady’s voice. She was screaming and begging, probably pleading to avoid getting beaten, as it sounded like she was being attacked on the stairs. The person hitting her had a voice full of rage, almost like a croak, and was speaking too quickly to understand. \n\nSuddenly, Raskolnikov felt a chill; he realized it was Ilya Petrovitch. Ilya was there, beating the landlady! He could hear her head banging against the steps, clear as day. It felt like the world had flipped upside down. People were rushing from every floor, shouting, knocking, and slamming doors. “Why is this happening?” he kept asking himself, worried he might be losing it. But no, he heard it too clearly! They might come for him next, probably because of what happened yesterday. “Oh no!” \n\nHe wanted to lock his door but couldn’t move his hand. Plus, it wouldn’t help anyway. Fear gripped his heart like ice, leaving him frozen and in pain. After about ten minutes, the chaos started to calm down. The landlady was still groaning, and Ilya was still cursing, but eventually, he fell silent. “Did he leave? Oh my God!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is horrified to hear his landlady being violently beaten by Ilya Petrovitch, leading him to question his sanity amidst the chaos."
