  "text": "You might think you’re living your best life, but it can all crash down. You could end up lost in a dark place. Trust me, if you stay alone, you’ll lose it like I almost did. You’re already on the edge. So we need to stick together! Let’s go! \n\n“Why? What’s the point?” Sonia asked, clearly shaken by what he said.\n\n“What’s the point? You can’t keep going like this! Face reality already instead of crying like a kid and saying God won’t allow it. What if you end up in the hospital tomorrow? Your mom is losing it and she’s sick. What about the kids? You think Polenka will be okay? Have you seen how kids here are sent out to beg? I know where those moms live and it’s a nightmare. Kids can’t stay innocent in those places! By seven, they’re already stealing. But remember, kids are supposed to be cherished: ‘theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.’ Jesus told us to love them; they’re our future.\n\n“What do we do? What do we do?” Sonia cried, her hands twisting in despair.\n\n“What do we do? Break what needs to be broken, once and for all. Take on the pain yourself. You don’t get it now, but you will later. It’s all about freedom and power—especially power! Over everything and everyone! That’s the goal. Keep that in mind! This might be my last message to you.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov urges Sonia to confront harsh realities and take decisive action for their future, emphasizing the need for power and freedom."
