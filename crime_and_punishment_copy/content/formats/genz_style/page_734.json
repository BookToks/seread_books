  "text": "I’m turning into a total mess, showing off to myself. Why am I even embarrassed? Ugh, people are so pushy! That fat guy—definitely a German—just bumped into me. Does he even know who he pushed? Over there’s a peasant woman with a baby, begging. It’s wild that she thinks I’m happier than she is. Maybe I should give her something, just for the irony. I’ve got this five copeck piece in my pocket—where did that even come from? Here, take it, lady! \n\n“God bless you,” she said, her voice all teary. \n\nI stepped into the Hay Market. Being in a crowd felt gross, but I walked where the people were. Honestly, I’d trade anything to be alone, but I know I wouldn’t last a second by myself. There’s a drunk guy in the crowd, trying to dance but just falling over. A bunch of people are watching him. I squeezed through, stared at the guy for a bit, then let out a short laugh. A minute later, I totally forgot about him, even though I was still looking. I finally moved away, not even sure where I was going. \n\nBut then, in the middle of the square, something hit me hard, both in my body and mind. I remembered Sonia’s words: “Go to the crossroads, bow down to the people, kiss the earth, because you’ve sinned against it too, and shout to the world, ‘I’m a murderer.’” I felt a shiver just thinking about it. All that hopeless misery and anxiety came flooding back.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov grapples with his guilt and shame in a crowded market, reflecting on his actions and the advice of Sonia to confess his sins."
