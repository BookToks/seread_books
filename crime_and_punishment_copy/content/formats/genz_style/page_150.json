She quickly curtsied almost to the ground and gracefully left the office.\n\n“Here we go again—thunder and lightning, a hurricane!” Nikodim Fomitch said to Ilya Petrovitch in a friendly tone. “You’re fired up again! I heard you on the stairs!” \n\n“Well, what of it?” Ilya Petrovitch replied casually, walking over to another table with a relaxed swagger. “Look here: an author or a student—whatever—won’t pay his debts, gave an IOU, won’t leave his room, and people keep complaining. And he even protested about my smoking in front of him!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The conversation highlights the disdain for authors and students who fail to pay their debts and create disturbances."
