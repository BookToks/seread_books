Not to mention, you’re comparing me to some rude kid. You’re even suggesting you might break your promise to me. When you say ‘you or he,’ it shows how little I mean to you… I can’t just let this slide, considering our relationship and the obligations we have.’\n\n‘What!’ Dounia exclaimed, her face flushing. ‘I’m putting your interests next to everything that’s been most important in my life, the stuff that makes up who I am, and you’re upset because I don’t value you enough?’\n\nRaskolnikov smirked sarcastically, Razumihin fidgeted, but Luzhin didn’t take the hint. Instead, he got even more pushy and irritable, almost enjoying the tension. \n\n‘Your love for the future partner in your life, your husband, should be stronger than your love for your brother,’ he declared dramatically. ‘And I can’t be compared to him… Even though I promised not to speak openly in your brother’s presence, I need to ask your mother for an important clarification that affects my dignity.
