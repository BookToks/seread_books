Not at all!” Sonia said, her voice filled with panic.  \n“And the kids? What can you do but take them in?”  \n“Oh, I don’t know,” Sonia cried, nearly in tears, putting her hands on her head.  \nIt was clear this thought had crossed her mind before, and he was just bringing it back up.  \n“And what if you get sick and end up in the hospital while Katerina Ivanovna is still alive? What then?” he pressed, showing no mercy.  \n“How can you say that? It can’t happen!”  \nSonia’s face twisted in fear.  \n“Can’t happen?” Raskolnikov said with a harsh grin. “You’re not safe from that, are you? What will happen to them then? They’ll be on the streets, she’ll be begging, banging her head against walls like today, and the kids will be crying… Then she’ll collapse, get taken to the police station and the hospital, she’ll die, and the kids…”  \n“Oh, no… God won’t let that happen!” Sonia finally burst out, overwhelmed.  \nShe looked at him, pleading, hands clasped in silent prayer, as if everything depended on him.  \nRaskolnikov stood up and started pacing the room.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia expresses despair over the potential suffering of Katerina Ivanovna and the children, fearing their dire future if circumstances worsen."
