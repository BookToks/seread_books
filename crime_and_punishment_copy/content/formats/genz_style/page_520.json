  "text": "‘And you’re just developing her, right? Hehe! Trying to show her that modesty is a joke?’  \n‘Not even close! You’re totally missing the point of development! Seriously, how … basic you are! We’re all about women’s freedom here, and you’re stuck on one idea. Let’s set aside the whole chastity and modesty debate—they’re just outdated ideas. I respect her choices completely. If she ever said she wanted me, I’d be thrilled because I really like her. But until then, I treat her with the utmost respect. I’m just waiting for her to make a move, that’s all!’  \n‘You should just get her a gift or something. Bet you didn’t think of that.’  \n‘You don’t get it! Sure, she’s in a tough spot, but that’s a different issue! You look down on her because you see something you think is pathetic, but you’re missing the humanity in her. You have no idea what kind of person she is! I just wish she’d start reading again. I used to lend her books, and it’s a shame she stopped. She’s shown a lot of spirit in standing up for herself, but she lacks the confidence to shake off some old prejudices and silly ideas. Still, she gets some things really well.’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The conversation reveals a character's belief in the importance of women's freedom and dignity, while critiquing societal prejudices against them."
