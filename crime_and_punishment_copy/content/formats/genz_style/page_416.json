  "text": "Chapter II\n\nIt was almost eight o’clock. The two guys rushed to Bakaleyev’s place to beat Luzhin there.\n\n“Who was that?” Razumihin asked as soon as they hit the street.\n\n“That was Svidrigaïlov, the landowner. He’s the one who made my sister’s life hell when she was a governess at his place. His wife, Marfa Petrovna, kicked her out because of his creepy behavior. Later, Marfa begged Dounia for forgiveness, but she just died out of nowhere. We were just talking about her this morning. I don’t know why, but I’m really uneasy about that guy. He showed up right after his wife’s funeral. He’s super weird and seems set on doing something… We need to keep Dounia safe from him. That’s what I wanted to tell you, got it?”\n\n“Keep her safe! What could he do to hurt Avdotya Romanovna? Thanks for the heads up, Rodya. We will protect her. Where does he live?”\n\n“No idea.”\n\n“Why didn’t you ask? That’s a bummer! I’ll find out, though.”\n\n“Did you see him?” Raskolnikov asked after a moment.\n\n“Yeah, I noticed him. I got a good look.”\n\n“You really saw him? You’re sure?” Raskolnikov pressed.\n\n“Yep, I remember him clearly. I’d recognize him anywhere.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses concern about Svidrigaïlov's intentions towards his sister Dounia after the recent death of Svidrigaïlov's wife."
