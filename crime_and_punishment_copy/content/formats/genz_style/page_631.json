How could I not start thinking certain things? \n\nYou can’t turn a bunch of rabbits into a horse, right? (That’s an English saying.) A hundred suspicions don’t equal proof. But hey, lawyers are human too—we can’t help but have our biases. \n\nRemember that article you wrote for that journal? We talked about it on your first visit. I teased you back then, but it was just to get you to open up. Honestly, Rodion, you’re sick and restless. I recognized your boldness and passion long before.

I might have laughed at you, but I actually love those first attempts at writing. They’re raw and full of youthful fire. Your article is wild and a bit out there, but it has this clear honesty and a brave spirit. It’s dark, sure, but that’s what makes it special. I read it and thought, “This guy isn’t going to take the usual path.” And that’s just the beginning!\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The speaker reflects on the complexities of human emotions and the misunderstandings that arise from them, particularly in relation to Rodion's character and his literary aspirations."
