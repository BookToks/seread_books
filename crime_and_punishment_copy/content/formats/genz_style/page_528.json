  "text": "Katerina Ivanovna was totally confused when she returned. Meanwhile, Lebeziatnikov was hanging by the window, pacing around, trying not to interrupt. Once Sonia left, he walked over to Pyotr Petrovitch and offered his hand seriously.\n\n“I saw everything,” he said, emphasizing “saw.” “That was honorable, I mean, it’s humane! You were trying to avoid gratitude, right? I noticed that! And even though I can’t really vibe with private charity (it doesn’t fix the problem and sometimes makes it worse), I have to admit, I liked what you did—yeah, I really liked it.”\n\n“That’s just nonsense,” Pyotr Petrovitch mumbled, looking a bit thrown off as he studied Lebeziatnikov.\n\n“No, it’s not nonsense! A guy like you, who went through a tough time yesterday but still feels for others? That’s someone to respect! Even if you’re making a social mistake, I didn’t expect that from you, Pyotr Petrovitch. Your ideas really hold you back! You’re upset about your bad luck yesterday, right?” Lebeziatnikov said, feeling a wave of affection for him. \n\n“And what’s the deal with your need for legal marriage? Why cling to that? Go ahead, hit me if you want, but honestly, I’m glad it didn’t happen. You’re free, and you’re not completely lost to humanity…”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Lebeziatnikov expresses admiration for Pyotr Petrovitch's humane actions despite his conflicting beliefs about private charity and marriage."
