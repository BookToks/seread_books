  "text": "You remember that rag we gave you? You clung to it for a whole day! We couldn’t pry it from your hands. It’s probably still under your quilt right now. And then you kept begging for fringe for your trousers. We tried to figure out what kind you wanted, but it was a total mystery.\n\nNow, onto business! Here’s thirty-five roubles. I’m taking ten for myself, and I’ll give you a breakdown of that in a bit. I’ll also let Zossimov know what's up since he should’ve been here ages ago—it's almost noon. Nastasya, check in on him while I’m out to see if he needs a drink or anything. I’ll handle Pashenka myself. Later! \n\n“He calls her Pashenka! He’s clever!” Nastasya said as he left. Then she opened the door, listened for a moment, and couldn't help but run after him. She was super curious about what he’d say to the landlady. Clearly, she was into Razumihin.\n\nAs soon as she was gone, the sick guy threw off his blankets and jumped out of bed like he was on fire. He’d been waiting impatiently for them to leave so he could get to work. But work on what? Now, it seemed to slip away from him. \n\n“Good God, just tell me one thing: do they know yet or not? What if they do and are just pretending? What if they’re mocking me while I’m stuck here? Then they’ll walk in and say it’s been found out ages ago, and I... What am I supposed to do now? I can’t even remember! It’s like I’ve forgotten everything on purpose.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The sick man is consumed by anxiety and impatience, fearing that his secret has been discovered while he is incapacitated."
