You can believe it or not, but the moment she walked in, I sensed she’s the main issue here…’  \n‘That’s ridiculous!’ Dounia shot back, annoyed. ‘What nonsense, Mom! He only met her the night before and didn’t even recognize her.’  \n‘Just wait and see… She makes me uneasy. Remember how she looked at me? I could barely sit still when he introduced her. It’s odd, but Pyotr Petrovitch writes about her like she’s important, and he brought her to us—to you! He must think a lot of her.’  \n‘People say all kinds of things. We’ve been talked about too, remember? I’m sure she’s a nice girl, and this is just silly.’  \n‘Let’s hope you’re right!’  \n‘And Pyotr Petrovitch is just a petty gossip,’ Dounia snapped.  \nPulcheria Alexandrovna felt defeated; the conversation ended there.  \n*****  \n‘Here’s what I need to talk to you about,’ Raskolnikov said, pulling Razumihin to the window.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pulcheria Alexandrovna expresses her concern that Sofya Semyonovna is the cause of their troubles, while Dounia dismisses her mother's presentiments as nonsense."
