I shouldn’t ask, but just tell me—are you going far?”  \n“Really far.”  \n“What’s waiting for you there? A job or something?”  \n“Whatever God sends… just pray for me.” Raskolnikov headed for the door, but she grabbed him, her eyes full of fear.  \n“Enough, Mom,” he said, wishing he hadn’t come.  \n“It’s not forever, right? You’ll be back tomorrow?”  \n“I will, I will. Bye.” He finally pulled away.  \n\nIt was a warm, fresh evening; the day had cleared up. Raskolnikov hurried to his place. He wanted to wrap things up before sunset. He didn’t want to run into anyone. As he climbed the stairs, he noticed Nastasya peeking from the samovar, watching him closely.  \n“Did someone come to see me?” he wondered, feeling a wave of disgust at the thought of Porfiry. But when he opened his door, he found Dounia inside. She was sitting alone, deep in thought, looking like she’d been waiting forever. He paused in the doorway. She stood up, clearly upset, her eyes locked on him.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses a sense of urgency and emotional turmoil as he prepares to leave, reassuring his mother while feeling the weight of his actions."
