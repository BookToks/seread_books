You’re such a weirdo.”  \n“I don’t want to,” the other replied, pulling his hand away again.  \n“Then why the heck did you come? Are you out of your mind? This is… kind of rude! I’m not letting you just walk out like that.”  \n“Well, I came to you because you’re the only one who could help… to start… because you’re nicer than anyone—cleverer, I mean, and can actually judge… and now I see I don’t want anything. Do you get it? Nothing at all… no one’s help… no one’s sympathy. I’m on my own… alone. That’s enough. Just leave me alone.”  \n“Stay a minute, you idiot! You’re completely crazy. Do what you want; I don’t care. I have no lessons today, and that’s fine, but there’s this bookseller, Heruvimov—he’s like a lesson substitute. I wouldn’t trade him for five lessons. He’s publishing stuff, like natural science manuals, and they’re selling like crazy! The titles alone are worth it! You always said I was a fool, but honestly, there are bigger fools out there! Now he’s acting all high and mighty, even though he doesn’t know anything, but I’m encouraging him. Check this out: I’ve got two signatures of a German text—it’s total nonsense; it’s asking, ‘Is woman a human being?’ And, of course, it “proves” that she is. Heruvimov is going to publish this as part of the woman question, and I’m translating it; he’ll expand those two and a half signatures.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The conversation reveals a sense of isolation and a rejection of help, highlighting the protagonist's internal struggle and desire for independence."
