  "text": "Pyotr Petrovitch was fuming. He thought, “They should’ve never turned me down so easily! These people can’t just ghost me after all the gifts and cash I’ve given them. Their conscience would eat at them: how can we ditch a guy who’s been so generous?” He realized he’d messed up. \n\nGrinding his teeth, he called himself a fool—just in his head, of course. \n\nWhen he got home, he was even angrier than before. As he walked by, he got curious about the funeral dinner Katerina Ivanovna was planning. He’d heard about it yesterday and thought he’d been invited, but he was too wrapped up in his own issues to pay attention. \n\nHe asked Madame Lippevechsel, who was busy setting the table while Katerina was out at the cemetery. She said it was going to be a big deal. All the lodgers were invited, even those who didn’t know the deceased. Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov was coming too, despite their past fight. Pyotr Petrovitch found out he was not just invited but was actually expected—he was the most important lodger! \n\nEven Amalia Ivanovna got a fancy invite, despite their recent drama. She was all dressed up in new black silk and was really into the preparations. This sparked an idea in Pyotr Petrovitch, so he headed to his room, which was actually Lebeziatnikov’s, feeling a bit thoughtful. He had learned that Raskolnikov was supposed to be there too.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pyotr Petrovitch feels frustrated and irritated by various personal and social obligations, particularly regarding a funeral dinner he is expected to attend."
