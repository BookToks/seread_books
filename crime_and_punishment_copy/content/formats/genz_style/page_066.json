Is she banking on the scraps left from her pension after Afanasy Ivanovitch’s debt is settled? She knits shawls and embroiders cuffs, straining her poor eyes. All that work barely adds up to twenty roubles a year on top of her hundred and twenty. So, she’s really pinning all her hopes on Mr. Luzhin being generous: “He’ll offer it himself; he’ll insist!” Good luck with that! \n\nThis is classic—people with noble hearts always think every goose is a swan until the bitter end. They cling to hope and ignore the red flags. Even when they sense something’s off, they refuse to face it. The thought of it freaks them out; they push the truth away until that charming guy shows his true colors and makes them look foolish. I wonder if Mr. Luzhin has any medals. I bet he has an Anna pin he wears when dining with contractors or merchants. He’ll definitely flaunt it at the wedding! Enough about him, honestly!\n\nAs for mom, I get it; that’s just her, bless her heart. But Dounia? Come on, sweetie, I know you too well! You were almost twenty the last time I saw you, and I understood you then. Mom says, “Dounia can handle a lot.” Trust me, I know that. I’ve been thinking about it for the past two and a half years.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The narrator expresses skepticism about Dounia's engagement to Mr. Luzhin, doubting his generosity and questioning her ability to endure his character."
