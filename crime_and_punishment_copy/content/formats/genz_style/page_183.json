  "text": "Rodya has people who care about him—a mom who would give up everything for him (even her 125 roubles pension) and a sister who would do anything to help. That’s his safety net. You look surprised, but I’ve got the scoop on your life, my guy. You were pretty open with Pashenka when you thought you might marry her, and I’m saying this as a friend. \n\nHere’s the deal: honest people are open, while business folks just take and take. So, Pashenka gave an IOU to Tchebarov, and he wasted no time demanding payment. When I heard that, I wanted to confront him to clear my conscience. But by then, things were good between me and Pashenka, so I decided to handle it differently. I promised you’d pay. I went on the hook for you, bro. \n\nWe called Tchebarov, tossed him ten roubles, and got that IOU back. Now she trusts you. Here it is, all torn up. Razumihin placed the note on the table. Raskolnikov just stared at the wall, not saying a word. Even Razumihin felt a bit guilty. \n\nAfter a moment, he said, “Looks like I’ve been a fool again. I thought I’d cheer you up with my rambling, but I think I just annoyed you.” \n\n“Were you the one I didn’t recognize when I was delirious?” Raskolnikov asked, still facing the wall.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin helps Raskolnikov by settling a debt and presenting him with a note, highlighting the support of family and friends amidst Raskolnikov's struggles."
