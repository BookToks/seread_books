I never deal with the police!” he thought, freaking out. “Just get it over with!” \n\nHe dropped to his knees to pray but ended up laughing— not because prayer was funny, but because he felt ridiculous. \n\nHe started getting dressed in a hurry. “If I’m doomed, then whatever! Should I put on this sock?” he wondered. “It’ll just get dirtier, and then no one will notice.” \n\nBut as soon as he put it on, he felt disgusted and ripped it off. Then he realized he had no other socks, so he picked it up and put it back on— and laughed again. \n\n“That’s just how it is; it’s all relative,” he thought for a second, but he was shivering all over. “Great, I’ve got it on!” \n\nBut soon, the laughter turned to despair. \n\n“Nope, this is too much…” he thought. His legs were shaking. “It’s just fear,” he muttered. His head was spinning and pounding with fever. “It’s a trap! They’re trying to lure me in and confuse me,” he mused as he stepped onto the stairs. “The worst part?
