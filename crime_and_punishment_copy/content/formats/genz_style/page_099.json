  "text": "\"But you think she's ugly?\" the officer asked.  \n\"Yeah, she's dark-skinned and looks like a soldier in a costume. But honestly, she's not ugly at all. Her face is kind, and her eyes really stand out. A lot of people are drawn to her. She's super gentle and just goes with the flow, always ready to help. And her smile? It's actually really sweet.\" ðŸ˜Š  \n\"You seem to like her,\" the officer chuckled.  \n\"Not like that! Look, I could totally kill that awful old woman and take her money without feeling guilty at all,\" the student said, getting fired up. The officer laughed again, but Raskolnikov felt a chill. It was all so bizarre!  \n\"Hey, I need to ask you something serious,\" the student said, his tone shifting. \"I was joking, but think about it: on one hand, we have this horrible, useless, spiteful old woman. She's not just a waste of space; she's causing real harm and doesn't even know why she's alive. She's going to kick the bucket soon anyway. You get what I mean?\"  \n\"Yeah, I get it,\" the officer replied, paying close attention to his friend.  \n\"Now, on the other hand, there are fresh young lives being wasted because they can't get help. Thousands of them! With that old woman's money, we could do a hundred thousand good deeds. Instead, it'll just sit in a monastery! We could save hundreds, maybe thousands of lives!\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The student argues that killing a worthless old woman could be justified if her money is used to save many lives."
