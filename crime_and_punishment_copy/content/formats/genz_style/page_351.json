I’ll read it on his face; if I don’t, it could ruin me.\n\n“Hey, bro,” he said with a sly grin, “you’re acting kinda jumpy today. Am I right?”\n\n“Jumpy? Not at all,” Razumihin shot back, clearly annoyed.\n\n“Yeah, really. You were sitting on that chair all weird, like you were on the edge of a volcano. You kept fidgeting and jumping up for no reason. One minute you’re mad, then your face is all soft, like candy. You even blushed a ton when they asked you to dinner.”\n\n“Not true! What are you talking about?”\n\n“Why are you dodging it like a kid caught in a lie? Look, you’re blushing again!”\n\n“What a jerk!”\n\n“Why are you so embarrassed? Romeo! Just wait, I’ll spill the tea today. Ha-ha! Mom’s gonna crack up, and maybe someone else too…”\n\n“Okay, okay, this is serious… What are you gonna say, you monster?” Razumihin was totally shaken, feeling cold dread. “Come on, bro… what a jerk!”\n\n“You’re like a summer rose. And honestly, it looks good on you; a tall Romeo! And you even cleaned up today—look at those nails!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov observes Razumihin's unusual excitement and playfully teases him about it."
