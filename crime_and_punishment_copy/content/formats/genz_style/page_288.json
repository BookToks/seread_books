  "text": "I’m human because I mess up! You can’t find truth without making a ton of mistakes—like fourteen or even a hundred and fourteen. But hey, that's part of it! The problem is, we can’t even mess up on our own terms. Speak your own nonsense, and I’ll totally support you. Going off course in your own way is way better than following someone else’s path. If you do the latter, you’re just a bird, not a person. You won’t miss the truth, but life can feel pretty limited. Trust me, there are examples of that.\n\nSo, what are we up to? In science, ideas, and everything else, we’re still in the beginner’s class. We stick to other people’s thoughts because that’s what we know! Right?

Give me your hand… you too! I want to kiss your hands right here, right now!” And he dropped to his knees on the empty pavement.\n\n“Stop, please! What are you doing?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna cried, really worried.\n\n“Get up, get up!” Dounia laughed, even though she was a bit concerned too.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of making one's own mistakes as a path to truth and individuality, rather than conforming to others' ideas."
