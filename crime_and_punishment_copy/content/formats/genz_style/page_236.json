  "text": "“Can’t handle that?” \n\n“Could you? I couldn’t. For a hundred roubles, face that kinda nightmare? Walking into a bank with fake notes? That’s their whole job—catching people like us! No way I could do it. Would you?”\n\nRaskolnikov felt a strong urge to just stick his tongue out. Chills ran down his spine. \n\n“I’d do it way differently,” he said. “Here’s my plan: I’d count the first thousand notes a few times, back and forth, checking every single one. Then I’d start on the second thousand. Halfway through, I’d hold up a fifty-rouble note to the light, check it out, then flip it over and check again to see if it's legit. I’d say something like, ‘You know, my relative lost twenty-five roubles recently because of a fake note,’ and spill the whole story. \n\n“Then, when I get to the third thousand, I’d act all flustered: ‘Wait, I think I messed up on the seventh hundred in that second thousand. I’m not sure.’ I’d ditch the third thousand and go back to the second, repeating this until I’m done. \n\n“When I finish, I’d grab one from the fifth and one from the second thousand, hold them up to the light again, and say, ‘Change these, please.’ I’d put the clerk in such a panic he wouldn’t know how to get rid of me. After I’m done and leave, I’d pop back in, ‘Oh, excuse me, can I get some clarification on this?’ That’s how I’d roll.”\n\n“Yikes! That’s some wild stuff you’re saying!” Zametov laughed.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov discusses a meticulous and deceptive method for exchanging counterfeit money, revealing his complex thoughts on crime."
