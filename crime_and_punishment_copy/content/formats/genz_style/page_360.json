Were you even thinking straight? Now that it’s all over, I can be real with you.” \n\n“I was super sick of them yesterday,” Raskolnikov shot back at Porfiry, smirking defiantly. “I ditched them to find a place where they wouldn’t bug me, and I took a bunch of cash with me. Mr. Zametov saw it. Hey, Zametov, was I sane or delirious yesterday? Settle this for us.” \n\nHe felt like he could strangle Zametov right then and there. The guy’s expression and silence were infuriating. \n\n“In my opinion, you were talking sensibly and even cleverly, but you were really irritable,” Zametov said dryly. \n\n“And Nikodim Fomitch told me today,” Porfiry added, “that he saw you super late last night at the place of a guy who got run over.” \n\n“And there,” Razumihin jumped in, “weren’t you out of your mind? You gave your last cash to the widow for the funeral. If you wanted to help, at least keep three roubles for yourself! But you threw all twenty-five at her!” \n\n“Maybe I found treasure or something, and you don’t know about it? That’s why I was so generous yesterday… Mr. Zametov knows I found treasure! Sorry for bothering you for half an hour with this nonsense,” he said to Porfiry, his lips trembling.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses his defiance and irritation while discussing his recent actions and financial decisions with Razumihin and Zametov."
