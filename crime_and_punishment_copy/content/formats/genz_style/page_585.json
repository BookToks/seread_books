  "text": "I found out lessons cost half a rouble. Razumihin is working hard! But I was in a mood and wouldnâ€™t go. (Yep, sulking is the right word!) I sat in my room like a spider. Youâ€™ve seen my little space. Do you know, Sonia, that low ceilings and tiny rooms really mess with your head? Ugh, I hated that attic! But still, I wouldnâ€™t leave it! I did it on purpose! Iâ€™d stay in for days, not working, not eatingâ€”just lying around. If Nastasya brought me food, cool. If not, Iâ€™d go all day without. I didnâ€™t want to ask for anything because I was sulking! At night, I had no light; I just lay in the dark, too cheap to buy candles. I shouldâ€™ve studied, but I sold my books. Thereâ€™s a thick layer of dust on my notebooks. I chose to just lie there and think. \n\nAnd think I did. I had all sorts of weird dreamsâ€”no need to get into that! But then I started to wonder: why am I so dumb? If everyone else is clueless (and I know they are), why canâ€™t I be smarter? Then it hit me, Sonia: waiting for everyone to get wiser would take forever. I realized that people wonâ€™t change, and itâ€™s pointless to stress over it. Thatâ€™s just how they are, Sonia. I get it now! The strong in mind and spirit will always have power over them. The bold ones are seen as right. Those who look down on most things will set the rules, and the ones who dare the most will be the ones everyone listens to! ðŸ’ª\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reflects on his isolation and the futility of waiting for others to change, concluding that true power lies in strength of mind and daring."
