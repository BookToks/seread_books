Cut me some slack, my friend. I’m not exactly a saint. Ha-ha!”\n\n“But you did take care of Katerina Ivanovna’s kids. Even if you had your reasons… I get it now.”\n\n“I’ve always liked kids—really, I do,” Svidrigaïlov chuckled. “Let me tell you something interesting. When I first got here, I hit up all the spots. After seven years, I couldn’t wait to dive back in. You probably noticed I’m not rushing to reconnect with my old crew. I can skip them for now. \n\nBack when I was with Marfa Petrovna in the countryside, I couldn’t stop thinking about these places. Anyone who knows the scene can find a lot going on. The peasants have their vodka, while the educated youth, stuck in their heads, are lost in wild dreams and theories. Meanwhile, the Jews are making bank, and everyone else is just partying hard. \n\nFrom the moment I arrived, the town hit me with its familiar smells. I ended up in this awful dive—I like my dives grimy—where a dance was happening. They were doing a cancan like I’ve never seen before. That’s what they call progress. Suddenly, I saw this twelve-year-old girl, all dressed up, dancing with a guy who knows how to do it, while another guy was across from them. Her mom was just sitting there against the wall. You wouldn’t believe the cancan they were doing! The girl was embarrassed, blushing, and eventually, she felt so insulted that she started crying. 😢”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov reflects on human nature, self-deception, and the moral decay he observes in society."
