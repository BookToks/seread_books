Go ahead!’ \n\nDounia lifted the revolver, pale as a ghost, staring at him while sizing up the distance. Her lower lip trembled, and her big black eyes were like fire. He’d never seen her look so stunning. The intensity in her gaze lit a spark in him, and he felt a sharp pain in his heart. He stepped forward, and then a shot rang out. The bullet skimmed his hair and hit the wall behind him. He stood there, chuckling softly.\n\n‘Ouch, a wasp got me. She aimed right for my head. What’s this? Blood?’ He pulled out a handkerchief to dab the thin stream running down his temple. The bullet had just barely grazed him.\n\nDounia lowered the revolver, staring at Svidrigaïlov, not really terrified but in a state of wild shock. It was like she didn’t know what she was doing or what was happening.\n\n‘Well, you missed! Go ahead and shoot again; I’ll wait,’ Svidrigaïlov said softly, still smiling, but there was a dark edge to it. ‘If you keep hesitating, I’ll have time to grab you before you can reload.’\n\nDounia jolted back to reality, quickly cocking the pistol again and raising it once more.\n\n‘Let me go!’ she shouted in desperation. ‘I swear I’ll shoot again. I … I’ll kill you.’\n\n‘At this distance, you probably can’t miss. But if you don’t … well, then.’ His eyes flashed, and he took two steps closer.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia confronts Svidrigaïlov with a revolver, demonstrating her desperation and determination amidst a tense standoff."
