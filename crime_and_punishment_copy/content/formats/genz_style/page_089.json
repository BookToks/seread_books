He tossed aside the whip and grabbed a thick shaft from the cart. He held it up with both hands, ready to swing. \n\n“He’s gonna crush her!” people shouted. “He’ll kill her!” \n\n“It’s my property!” Mikolka shouted back, bringing the shaft down hard. A heavy thud echoed. \n\n“Keep going! Why’d you stop?” yelled voices from the crowd. \n\nMikolka swung again, hitting the poor mare squarely on her back. She collapsed but then struggled to pull the cart, swaying side to side, trying to escape. But the six whips were coming down on her from every direction. The shaft came down again and again, hitting her with brutal force. Mikolka was furious that he couldn’t finish her off in one blow. \n\n“She’s tough,” someone in the crowd shouted. \n\n“She’ll go down soon, just wait,” another spectator said, impressed. \n\n“Get an axe! End it!” shouted a third voice. \n\n“Just watch me! Step back!” Mikolka screamed, throwing the shaft aside. He bent down, grabbed an iron crowbar from the cart, and shouted, “Look out!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Mikolka violently beats a mare in front of a cheering crowd, demonstrating cruelty and indifference to suffering."
