  "text": "Raskolnikov and Razumihin were brainstorming a new project. They planned to create a flashy title that was half a page long and sell it for half a rouble. Easy money! Razumihin was getting paid six roubles per signature, so that meant around fifteen roubles for the whole job. He had already received six in advance. \n\nAfter this gig, they wanted to tackle a translation about whales and some boring scandals from the second part of \"Les Confessions.\" Someone mentioned to Heruvimov that Rousseau was like a Radishchev (a notable figure). Razumihin wasn’t about to correct him—why bother? \n\nThen he asked, “Want to help with the second signature of ‘Is Woman a Human Being?’” If Raskolnikov was interested, he could grab the German text, pens, and paper—all set up. Razumihin offered three roubles for Raskolnikov’s share since he had already gotten six roubles for the whole thing. \n\nHe added, “Don’t think I’m doing you a favor. Honestly, I need your help. I struggle with spelling, and my German is all over the place. I often just wing it. But hey, it has to be an improvement, right? Or maybe not. So, what do you say?” \n\nRaskolnikov took the German sheets without a word, grabbed the three roubles, and left. Razumihin watched him, surprised. But then, Raskolnikov turned back, climbed the stairs again, placed the German article and the three roubles on the table, and walked out again—still silent.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reluctantly accepts a translation job from Razumihin but later returns the materials and payment without explanation."
