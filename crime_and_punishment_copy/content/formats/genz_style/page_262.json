  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nMarmeladov didn’t recognize Raskolnikov and started looking around, clearly uneasy. Katerina Ivanovna had a sad but serious expression, with tears streaming down her face. \n\n“My God! His whole chest is crushed! Look at all this blood,” she said, panicking. “We need to take off his clothes. Semyon Zaharovitch, can you turn a bit?” she urged him.\n\nMarmeladov finally recognized her. “A priest,” he croaked.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna walked to the window, resting her head against the frame, and cried out in despair, “Oh, cursed life!”\n\n“A priest,” Marmeladov repeated after a moment of silence.\n\n“They’ve gone to get him,” Katerina Ivanovna shouted, and he fell silent, looking at her with sad, timid eyes. She returned to his side, and he seemed a bit more comfortable, but not for long.\n\nHis gaze landed on little Lida, his favorite, who was trembling in the corner, staring at him with wide, innocent eyes. \n\n“A-ah,” he gestured toward her, wanting to say something.\n\n“What now?” Katerina Ivanovna asked, concerned.\n\n“Barefoot, barefoot!” he muttered, his eyes frantic as he pointed at the child’s bare feet.\n\n“Be quiet,” Katerina Ivanovna snapped, “you know why she’s barefoot.”\n\n“Thank God, the doctor,” Raskolnikov said, feeling relieved.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna is in despair over Marmeladov's severe injuries and the dire situation of their family."
