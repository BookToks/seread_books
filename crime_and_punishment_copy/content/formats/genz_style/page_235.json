They were like a little society, forging tickets!\"\n\nRaskolnikov shrugged. \"That was ages ago. I saw that a month back,\" he replied coolly. \"So you think they’re real criminals?\" He smiled, almost teasing.\n\n\"Of course they are!\" Zametov shot back.\n\n\"Really? They’re just kids, naive fools, not criminals! I mean, come on—half a hundred people trying to pull off something like that? Three would be too many! They trust each other more than themselves. Just one drunk spilling secrets and it all falls apart. Total simpletons! They even hired unreliable people to change the cash—what a dumb move! Imagine if they actually succeeded and each made a million. They’d be stuck depending on each other forever! Might as well just end it now. Plus, they didn’t even know how to change the notes right. The guy who did it took five thousand roubles, but he was so nervous his hands shook. He counted the first four thousand but skipped the last one—too eager to pocket the cash and run. Of course, that raised suspicion! And it all crashed because of one idiot! Can you believe it?\"\n\nZametov nodded. \"Yeah, I get that. Sometimes people just can’t handle the pressure.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov dismisses a recent gang of false coiners as simpletons rather than true criminals, highlighting the fragility of their scheme and the risks of dependence on others."
