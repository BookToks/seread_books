  "text": "Raskolnikov felt a heavy weight in his heart, knowing Sonia would be with him forever, no matter where life took him. It was a bittersweet feeling as he approached a crucial moment.\n\nHe walked into the yard, determined. He had to climb to the third floor. \"This might take a while,\" he thought, feeling like he had plenty of time to think it over.\n\nThe same old mess greeted him: eggshells on the spiral stairs, open doors to apartments, and the familiar smells wafting from the kitchens. He hadn't been here since that day. His legs felt weak, but he pushed through. He paused to catch his breath and steady himself. \"Why am I doing this?\" he wondered. \"If I have to face it, might as well do it now.\" \n\nHe pictured the 'explosive lieutenant,' Ilya Petrovitch. Was he really going to him? Couldn’t he just go to Nikodim Fomitch instead? That would be more private. But no! It had to be the 'explosive lieutenant.' If he had to face it, he might as well do it quickly.\n\nFeeling cold and barely aware of himself, he opened the office door. There weren’t many people inside—just a house porter and a peasant. The doorkeeper didn’t even look up from behind his screen. Raskolnikov stepped into the next room. \"Maybe I don’t even have to say anything,\" he thought.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels the weight of his fate as he prepares to confront a pivotal moment in his life, reflecting on his connection to Sonia and the inevitability of his actions."
