You don’t get it; you’re acting like a kid!” she shouted, out of breath and coughing. “I’m not going back to that drunk German. Let everyone in Petersburg see these kids begging! Their dad was a good man who worked hard and died serving others.” (She had totally made up this story but believed it.) “Let that awful general see it! And you’re being foolish, Sonia. What are we even going to eat? We’ve already bothered you enough. I can’t keep this up!”\n\nSuddenly, she spotted Raskolnikov. “Oh, Rodion Romanovitch! There you are!” she exclaimed, rushing over. “Please tell this silly girl that this is the best we can do! Even organ-grinders make a living, and everyone will see we’re different—an honorable family fallen on hard times. That general will lose his job, just wait! We’ll perform outside his window every day, and if the Tsar drives by, I’ll kneel down, put the kids in front of me, and say, ‘Protect us, Father!’ He’s the father of the fatherless; he’ll help us, you’ll see! And that awful general… Lida, stand up straight! Kolya, you’re dancing again. Why are you crying? Stop it! What are you scared of, silly? What am I supposed to do with them, Rodion Romanovitch?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna insists on begging in the streets to expose their plight, despite Sonia's pleas to return home."
