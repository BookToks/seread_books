The tavern was a dump, not even second-rate.\n\n“I was looking for you,” Raskolnikov said. “But I don’t know why I turned from the Hay Market to X. Prospect just now. I never go this way. I usually turn right from the Hay Market. And somehow, here you are. It’s weird!” \n\n“Why not just say it’s a miracle?” Svidrigaïlov shot back.\n\n“Because it could just be chance.”\n\n“Ah, that’s how you all are,” Svidrigaïlov laughed. “You won’t admit it, even if deep down you think it’s a miracle! You say it might just be chance. And the people here? They’re too scared to have their own opinions. You, Rodion Romanovitch, you’re different. You think for yourself, and that’s what caught my interest.”\n\n“Is that all?” \n\n“Well, it’s enough, you know,” Svidrigaïlov replied, clearly a bit tipsy but not too far gone—he’d only had half a glass of wine.\n\n“I think you came to see me before you realized I could think for myself,” Raskolnikov said.\n\n“Oh, that’s a different story. Everyone’s got their own plans. Speaking of miracles…”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov unexpectedly encounters Svidrigaïlov at a dismal tavern, leading to a discussion about chance and belief in miracles."
