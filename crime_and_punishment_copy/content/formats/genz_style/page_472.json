Here you are … in our space,” Porfiry started, stretching out both hands. “Come on, sit down, man … or maybe you don’t want to be called ‘my dude’ and ‘man!’—/tout court? Don’t think I’m being too familiar…. Here, take a seat on the sofa.”\n\nRaskolnikov plopped down, his gaze locked on him. “In our space,” the awkward apologies, and that French phrase tout court were all classic signs.\n\n“He offered both hands, but he pulled one back just in time,” Raskolnikov thought, feeling suspicious. They were both sizing each other up, but when their eyes met, they quickly looked away.\n\n“I brought you this paper … about the watch. Here it is. Is it cool, or should I rewrite it?” \n\n“What? A paper? Yeah, yeah, don’t stress, it’s all good,” Porfiry Petrovitch replied quickly. After saying that, he grabbed the paper and glanced at it. “Yep, it’s fine. Nothing else needed,” he declared just as fast, then tossed the paper on the table.\n\nA minute later, while chatting about something else, he picked it up from the table and set it on his bureau.\n\n“I think you mentioned yesterday you wanted to question me … formally … about my connection with the murdered woman?” Raskolnikov started again. “Why did I say ‘I think’?” flashed through his mind. “Why am I so anxious about saying ‘I think’?” came the next thought. Suddenly, he felt that his discomfort around Porfiry, from the first words to the first looks, had ballooned into something huge.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels intense unease and suspicion during his encounter with Porfiry Petrovitch, reflecting his inner turmoil and fear."
