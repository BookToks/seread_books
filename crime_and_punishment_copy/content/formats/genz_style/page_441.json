If I pitched it to a publisher, they’d probably hesitate—so clueless! \n\nAnd don’t worry about the business side—printing, paper, selling—I’ve got that covered. We’ll start small and grow big.

But let’s discuss it later…”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The characters discuss the potential of starting a publishing venture, highlighting their confidence in its success and the experience of one member in the business."
