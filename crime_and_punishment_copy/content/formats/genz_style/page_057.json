She got annoyed and said, “Words aren’t actions,” which is totally true. \n\nDounia couldn’t sleep all night. She thought I was out cold, but she was pacing the room. Eventually, she knelt in front of the ikon and prayed hard. In the morning, she told me she’d made a decision. \n\nI already mentioned that Pyotr Petrovitch is heading to Petersburg soon. He’s got a lot on his plate, including opening a legal office. He’s been in the game for years, handling civil and commercial cases, and just recently won a big one. He needs to be in Petersburg for an important case before the Senate. So, Rodya, he could really help you out in so many ways. Dounia and I think this could kickstart your career and set your future in motion. If this works out, it’d be like a blessing from above. Dounia can’t stop thinking about it.

He was careful in his response…\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia has decided to pursue a potential opportunity with Pyotr Petrovitch, believing it could significantly benefit her brother Rodya's future."
