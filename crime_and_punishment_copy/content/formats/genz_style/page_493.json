What will you say if you plan to arrest me?” Raskolnikov grabbed his cap and headed to the door.\n\n“Wait! Don’t you want to see my little surprise?” Porfiry chuckled, grabbing Raskolnikov’s arm to stop him.\n\nThis playful vibe just made Raskolnikov even angrier. “What surprise?” he asked, anxiety creeping in.\n\n“It’s behind that door, he-he-he!” Porfiry pointed to a locked door. “I locked him in so he wouldn’t run away.”\n\n“What is it? Where? Let me see…” Raskolnikov approached the door, ready to open it, but it wouldn’t budge.\n\n“It’s locked. Here’s the key!” Porfiry pulled a key from his pocket.\n\n“You’re lying!” Raskolnikov shouted, losing it. “You’re just messing with me!” He lunged at Porfiry, who calmly stepped back to the other door.\n\n“I get it now! You’re just trying to make me slip up…” \n\n“Oh, please. You couldn’t give yourself away any more than you already have, my friend.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confronts Porfiry about his suspicions and feels trapped in a psychological game."
