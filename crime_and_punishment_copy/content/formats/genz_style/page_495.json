  "text": "### Chapter VI\n\nWhen Raskolnikov thought back on it, this is how he saw the scene unfold.\n\nThe noise behind the door got louder, and suddenly it creaked open a bit.\n\n“What’s going on?” Porfiry Petrovitch snapped, clearly annoyed. “I gave orders…”\n\nFor a moment, no one answered. It was clear there were a bunch of people at the door, and they seemed to be pushing someone back.\n\n“What’s happening?” Porfiry asked again, looking uneasy.\n\n“The prisoner Nikolay has been brought in,” someone replied.\n\n“He’s not needed! Get him out of here! Let him wait! What’s he doing here? This is so irregular!” Porfiry shouted, rushing to the door.\n\n“But he…” the same voice started, then trailed off.\n\nIn just a couple of seconds, there was a struggle, and then a very pale man strode into the room.\n\nAt first glance, this guy looked strange. He stared straight ahead, as if he wasn’t seeing anything. There was a fierce look in his eyes, but his face was deathly pale, like he was being led to his execution. His white lips twitched slightly.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov recalls the chaotic moment when the prisoner Nikolay is unexpectedly brought into the room, causing confusion and annoyance among the officials."
