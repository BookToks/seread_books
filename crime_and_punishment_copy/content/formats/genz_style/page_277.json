So, give me your hand!” \n\n“What’s up with you, Rodya?” \n\n“Nothing… let’s go… you’ll see.” \n\nAs they climbed the stairs, Razumihin thought maybe Zossimov was right after all. “Great, I’ve messed him up with my talking!” he muttered to himself. \n\nWhen they got to the door, they heard voices inside. \n\n“What’s going on?” Razumihin shouted.
