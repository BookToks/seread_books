Dounia’s face kept popping into his mind, making him shudder. “I need to let that go,” he thought, trying to shake it off. “It’s weird. I’ve never really hated anyone or wanted revenge, which is kind of messed up. I don’t even like fighting or losing my cool—definitely not a good sign. And those promises I made to her? Ugh!
