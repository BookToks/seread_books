  "text": "I couldn’t help but notice Avdotya Romanovna right away. I saw the risk and decided to ignore her. But guess what? She made the first move. Can you believe it? Marfa Petrovna was actually annoyed with me for not talking about your sister and for brushing off her endless praises of Avdotya. I have no idea what she wanted from me!\n\nOf course, Marfa Petrovna spilled all the family tea to Avdotya. She had this annoying habit of telling everyone our secrets and complaining about me. How could she resist sharing with such a charming new friend? They probably talked about me non-stop, and I bet Avdotya heard all the weird rumors floating around about me. I wouldn’t be surprised if you’ve heard some of that gossip too.\n\n“I have,” you said. “Luzhin accused you of causing a child’s death. Is that true?”\n\n“Please don’t bring up those ridiculous stories,” Svidrigaïlov replied, clearly annoyed. “If you really want to know about that nonsense, I’ll explain one day, but not now…”\n\n“I also heard about some footman you treated badly in the country.”\n\n“Can we please drop this topic?” Svidrigaïlov cut in, visibly irritated.\n\n“Was that the footman who came to you after he died to fill your pipe? You told me about that yourself.” Raskolnikov was getting more and more frustrated.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov reflects on the gossip surrounding him and his relationships, particularly regarding Avdotya Romanovna and Marfa Petrovna's influence."
