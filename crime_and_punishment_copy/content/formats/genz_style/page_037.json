He’ll say, “You’re like swine, made in the image of the Beast, but still, come here!” \n\nThe wise will ask, “Lord, why accept these people?” And He’ll reply, “I accept them because none of them think they deserve it.” He’ll stretch out His hands, and we’ll fall down before Him… we’ll weep… and we’ll finally understand everything!

His words hit hard, creating a moment of silence, but soon laughter and curses broke out again. \n\n“That’s his idea!”  \n“Talking nonsense!”  \n“What a clerk he is!”  \nAnd so on, and so on.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marmeladov expresses a profound belief in divine forgiveness for all, including the marginalized and sinful, before succumbing to exhaustion and indifference from those around him."
