If they ended up in Nikolayâ€™s hands on the same day and hour, thereâ€™s got to be a story there. Thatâ€™s a big deal.â€™  \nâ€˜How did they get there? How did they get there?â€™ Razumihin shouted. â€˜Youâ€™re a doctor! You study people and you know human nature better than anyone. How can you not see the truth in this whole situation? The answers he gave during the exam are the real deal! He found the box and picked it up, just like he said.â€™  \nâ€˜The real deal? But didnâ€™t he admit he lied at first?â€™  \nâ€˜Listen closely.

They all say Nikolay had Dmitri on the ground, beating him up while Dmitri was pulling his hair and hitting back. They were sprawled out in the middle of the street, blocking traffic. People were yelling at them while they were acting like kidsâ€”falling over each other, squealing, and laughing with goofy faces. Then they ran into the street like a bunch of children.
