  "text": "It’s been ten years since I last hit up Petersburg. I’ve heard all the new trends, reforms, and ideas have made their way to the provinces, but to really get the vibe, you gotta be in the city. I think you learn the most by watching the younger crowd. Honestly, I’m pretty impressed… \n\n“Impressed by what?” \n\n“That’s a big question. I might be wrong, but I feel like I see clearer opinions, more criticism, and a bit more practicality…” \n\n“That’s true,” Zossimov chimed in. \n\n“Come on! There’s no practicality!” Razumihin shot back. “Finding practicality is tough; it doesn’t just fall from the sky. For the last two hundred years, we’ve been totally out of touch with real life. Sure, ideas are bubbling up,” he said to Pyotr Petrovitch, “and there’s a desire for good, even if it’s a bit naive. You can find honesty, but there are also tons of crooks. Bottom line: practicality is nowhere to be found. It walks around with fancy shoes.” \n\n“I disagree,” Pyotr Petrovitch said, clearly enjoying the debate. “Sure, people get carried away and mess up, but we should be forgiving. Those mistakes just show how passionate they are and how tough the outside world is. If not much has happened yet, it’s only been a short time. I won’t even get into resources. Personally, I think we’ve made some progress. Fresh, valuable ideas and works are replacing our old, dreamy authors. Literature is maturing, and a lot of harmful prejudices are getting kicked to the curb.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The discussion highlights differing perspectives on the practicality and progress of ideas and literature in Petersburg's younger generation."
