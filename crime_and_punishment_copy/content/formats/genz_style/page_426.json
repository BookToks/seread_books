  "text": "I need this sorted out ASAP. Honestly, I can’t see it any other way. If you care about me at all, we need to wrap this up today, no matter how tough it gets. If my brother messed up, he’ll apologize. \n\n“I’m shocked you’d even ask that,” Luzhin said, getting more annoyed. “I can totally adore you and still not like your family. Just because I want to marry you doesn’t mean I’ll take on duties that don’t fit…”\n\n“Come on, don’t be so quick to get offended, Pyotr Petrovitch,” Dounia cut in, sounding sincere. “Be the smart and generous guy I know you can be. I’ve made a big promise—I’m engaged to you. Trust me here; I can be fair. My role as judge is just as surprising for my brother as it is for you. When I asked him to join our talk after your letter, I didn’t tell him my plan. \n\nLook, if you two can’t make up, I have to choose between you. It’s either you or him. That’s the deal. I need to be sure I’m making the right choice. For your sake, I might have to cut ties with my brother. For his sake, I might have to let you go. I want to know if he’s really my brother and if you truly care about me.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia insists that she must choose between her brother and her fiancé, Pyotr Petrovitch, to resolve their conflict."
