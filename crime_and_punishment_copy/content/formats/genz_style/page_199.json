  "text": "Dushkin's story goes like this: He gave a guy named Nikolay two roubles. When he asked where Nikolay got them, the answer was that he found them in the street. Dushkin didn’t pry any further. \n\nHe thought, \"If Nikolay isn’t pawning it with me, he’ll just do it elsewhere.\" Either way, it’d probably go toward booze, so better to keep it close. His plan? If he hears any gossip, he’ll take it to the cops. But honestly, that’s just nonsense. Dushkin is a pawnbroker and a receiver of stolen goods. He didn’t cheat Nikolay out of a thirty-rouble trinket to hand it over to the police. He was just scared. \n\nAnyway, back to Dushkin. He’s known Nikolay since they were kids. They’re both from Ryazan. Nikolay isn’t a full-blown drunk, but he does drink. Dushkin knew he was working in a house, painting with Dmitri, who’s also from their village. Once Nikolay got that rouble, he changed it, had a few drinks, grabbed his change, and left. Dushkin didn’t see Dmitri with him at that time.\n\nThen the next day, news broke that someone had murdered Alyona and her sister, Lizaveta, with an axe. Dushkin knew them and immediately thought about the earrings, since Alyona lent money on pledges. He went to the house and started asking questions without letting anyone in on what he was doing. First, he asked, \"Is Nikolay here?\" Dmitri told him Nikolay had gone on a bender and came home drunk at dawn.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dushkin, a pawnbroker, recounts his suspicions regarding Nikolay, a painter, after hearing about the murder of Alyona and Lizaveta Ivanovna."
