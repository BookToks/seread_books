  "text": "\"Did you forget?\"  \n\"No, I remember.\"  \n\"I heard my dad talk about you. I didn’t know your name, and he didn’t either. So, I came here and asked, 'Where does Mr. Raskolnikov live?' I didn’t realize you only had a room too. Anyway, I’ll tell Katerina Ivanovna.\"  \n\nShe was super relieved to finally leave. She hurried away, looking down, wanting to disappear as fast as possible. Just twenty steps to the right, and she'd be alone. Then she could think, remember, and go over every word and detail. She’d never felt anything like this before. A whole new world was opening up for her, even if she didn’t fully get it yet.  \n\nSuddenly, she remembered Raskolnikov was supposed to visit her today—maybe even right now!  \n\"Not today, please, not today!\" she kept whispering, her heart sinking, like she was begging someone. \"Mercy! Not to that room… he’ll see… oh no!\"  \n\nIn that moment, she didn’t notice a stranger watching her and following closely behind. He had come with her from the gateway. Just as Razumihin, Raskolnikov, and she were parting on the pavement, this guy heard Sonia say, \"I asked where Mr. Raskolnikov lived?\" He quickly glanced at all three, especially at Raskolnikov.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia feels a mix of anxiety and anticipation as she reflects on her encounter with Raskolnikov, sensing a new world opening before her."
