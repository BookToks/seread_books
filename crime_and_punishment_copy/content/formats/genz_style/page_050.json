  "text": "Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov was a real piece of work. He treated Dounia pretty rudely and made snarky comments at the dinner table. ðŸ˜’ But I wonâ€™t dive into those painful details since itâ€™s all behind us now. \n\nDespite Marfa Petrovna, Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lovâ€™s wife, being kind and generous, Dounia had a tough time. Things got worse when Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov, fueled by alcohol, reverted to his old nasty habits. \n\nYou wonâ€™t believe this: he actually had a crush on Dounia from the start but hid it behind his rude behavior. Maybe he felt ashamed of his feelings because of his age and being a family man, which just made him angrier at Dounia. He probably thought being a jerk would keep people from guessing the truth. \n\nBut eventually, he lost it and made Dounia a disgusting proposal, promising her all sorts of things and even suggesting they run away together to another estate or abroad. Can you imagine what she went through? \n\nLeaving her job wasnâ€™t an optionâ€”not just because of the money she owed but also to protect Marfa Petrovnaâ€™s feelings. If she left, it would raise suspicions and cause a family rift. Plus, it would create a huge scandal for Dounia, and nobody wanted that. There were a lot of reasons why Dounia felt trapped in that awful situation.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia endured a difficult situation with Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov, who concealed his passion for her under rudeness and ultimately made her an indecent proposal."
