  "text": "They stepped out into the street.  \n“Dounia, I had the weirdest dream this morning. I saw Marfa Petrovna—she was all in white. She came up, took my hand, and shook her head at me, like she was scolding me. Is that a good sign? Oh, and by the way, you don’t know, Dmitri Prokofitch, that Marfa Petrovna’s dead!”  \n“No, I didn’t know. Who’s Marfa Petrovna?”  \n“She died suddenly, and just imagine…”  \n“Let’s save that for later, Mom,” Dounia interrupted. “He doesn’t know who Marfa Petrovna is.”  \n“Oh, you don’t know? I thought you were in the loop. Sorry, Dmitri Prokofitch. I’ve been all over the place lately. I see you as a lifesaver for us, so I assumed you knew everything. I kind of think of you as family… Don’t be mad at me for saying that. By the way, what happened to your right hand? Did you hurt it?”  \n“Yeah, I bruised it,” Razumihin said, clearly pleased.  \n“I sometimes spill my heart too much, and Dounia gets on my case about it… But seriously, what a tiny place he lives in! I wonder if he’s awake. Does his landlady really think this is a room? You say he doesn’t like to show emotions, so maybe I’ll just annoy him with my feelings? What do you think, Dmitri Prokofitch? I feel so lost right now.”  \n“Just don’t ask him too many questions if he looks upset. And steer clear of asking about his health; he hates that.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia expresses concern about how to interact with her brother, Raskolnikov, while discussing their family situation and the recent death of Marfa Petrovna."
