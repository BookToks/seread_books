Voices went from loud to quiet. There were a lot of them—basically everyone in the building. “But, seriously, how could this happen? And why did he come here?” \n\nRaskolnikov collapsed onto the sofa, but sleep wouldn’t come. He lay there for half an hour, feeling a terror he’d never felt before. Suddenly, a bright light burst into his room. Nastasya walked in with a candle and a plate of soup. She checked to see if he was awake, then set the candle on the table and started laying out what she brought—bread, salt, a plate, a spoon. \n\n“You haven’t eaten since yesterday, right? You’ve been wandering around all day, and you’re burning up with fever.” \n\n“Nastasya… why were they beating the landlady?” \n\nShe stared at him. \n\n“Who beat the landlady?” \n\n“Just now… half an hour ago, Ilya Petrovitch, the assistant superintendent, on the stairs… Why was he treating her like that, and why was he here?” \n\nNastasya studied him, silent and frowning. Her gaze felt like it lasted forever. He grew uneasy, even scared, under her intense stare. \n\n“Nastasya, why don’t you say anything?” he finally asked in a weak voice. \n\n“It’s the blood,” she replied softly, almost as if she was afraid.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is consumed by terror and confusion after hearing a violent incident involving his landlady."
