Porfiry Petrovitch stood there, deep in contemplation, but then shook it off and shooed away the onlookers. They quickly left, shutting the door behind them.\n\nPorfiry turned to Raskolnikov, who was in the corner, eyes wide and fixated on Nikolay. He stepped closer but hesitated, glancing between the two. Then he suddenly charged at Nikolay.\n\n“Calm down!” he yelled, almost mad. “I didn’t ask for your story. Just tell me—did you kill them?”\n\n“I’m the murderer… I want to confess,” Nikolay said.\n\n“Ugh! What did you use?” \n\n“An axe. I had it ready.”\n\n“Wow, you’re rushing! Did you do it alone?”\n\nNikolay looked confused. \n\n“Did you do it by yourself?”\n\n“Yes, alone. Mitka had nothing to do with it.”\n\n“Hold on about Mitka! Why did you run downstairs like that? The porters saw you both!”\n\n“I was trying to throw them off the trail… I ran after Mitka,” Nikolay replied quickly, as if he had rehearsed it.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Nikolay confesses to being the murderer, claiming he acted alone with an axe."
