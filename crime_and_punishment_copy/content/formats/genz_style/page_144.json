  "text": "Raskolnikov stood there, not sitting down even though there was a chair next to the woman. \n\n“Thank you,” she said, and with a soft rustle of her fancy silk dress, she settled into the chair. Her light blue dress, trimmed with white lace, puffed out like a balloon and took up almost half the room. She smelled super strong of perfume. But you could tell she felt awkward about taking up so much space and being so fragrant. Her smile was a mix of cocky and nervous, showing her unease.\n\nFinally, the lady in mourning finished up and got up. Suddenly, an officer swaggered in, strutting with a unique shoulder swing. He tossed his fancy cap onto the table and plopped down in an easy chair. The small woman practically jumped from her seat when she saw him, curtsying like she was in a dream. But the officer didn’t even glance her way, and she didn’t dare sit back down around him. He was the assistant superintendent, sporting a reddish moustache that jutted out on either side of his face, with tiny features that didn’t show much except for a bit of arrogance. He shot a disdainful look at Raskolnikov, clearly judging him for his shabby clothes. Raskolnikov had accidentally stared at him for too long, making the officer feel insulted.\n\n“What do you want?” he barked, clearly shocked that someone so ragged wasn’t shrinking away from his intimidating gaze.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a mix of relief and embarrassment in a tense social encounter with a lady and an officer."
