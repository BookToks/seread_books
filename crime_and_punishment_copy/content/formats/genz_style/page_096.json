  "text": "**Chapter VI**\n\nLater, Raskolnikov found out why the huckster and his wife invited Lizaveta. It was pretty basic—nothing special. A family new to town had fallen on hard times and was trying to sell their stuff, mostly women’s clothes and household items. Since they wouldn’t get much at the market, they needed a dealer. That’s where Lizaveta came in. She usually took on these gigs because she was honest, always set a fair price, and stuck to it. She didn’t talk much and was pretty timid.\n\nBut Raskolnikov had been feeling superstitious lately. Those vibes stuck around for a while, and he started seeing everything as strange and mysterious, like there were hidden influences at play. Last winter, a student he knew named Pokorev had casually mentioned the address of Alyona Ivanovna, the old pawnbroker, in case Raskolnikov ever needed to pawn something. He didn’t go to her for a long time because he was busy with lessons and somehow managing. But six weeks ago, he remembered that address. He had two things he could pawn: his dad’s old silver watch and a little gold ring.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov learns about Lizaveta's work with a family in poverty, revealing his growing superstitions and connections to the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna."
