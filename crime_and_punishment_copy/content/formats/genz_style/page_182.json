  "text": "Raskolnikov looked away, mumbling, “No,” but he knew it was better to keep talking. \n\n“Is she clever?” Razumihin asked, clearly excited to get a response. “Not really, right? She’s kind of an enigma! Honestly, I’m baffled sometimes. She says she’s thirty-six, but I swear she’s at least forty. She can say whatever she wants, though. From my perspective, it’s like we have this weird connection—some kind of symbolism or whatever. I can’t even explain it! But here’s the deal: since you’re not a student anymore and you’ve lost your stuff, she got scared. With the young lady gone, she doesn’t feel the need to treat you like family anymore. So, she’s been planning to cut ties with you for a while. She was just hesitant to give up the I O U because you told her your mom would pay it back.”\n\nRaskolnikov replied, “It was wrong of me to say that… My mom’s basically broke, and I lied just to keep my place and get some food.” \n\n“Smart move, honestly. But here’s the kicker: Mr. Tchebarov shows up—he’s a businessman. Pashenka wouldn’t have done anything on her own; she’s too shy. But this guy? He’s all about business. First thing he asks is, ‘Can we cash in that I O U?’ And the answer is yes…”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reflects on his deceit regarding his mother's financial situation and the implications it has on his relationships."
