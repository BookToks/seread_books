  "text": "**Crime and Punishment**  \n**Chapter III**  \n\n“He’s doing well, really well!” Zossimov said with a smile as they walked in.  \n\nHe had arrived ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the same spot on the sofa. Raskolnikov was in the opposite corner, fully dressed and finally looking clean and combed—something he hadn’t done in a while. The room quickly filled up, but Nastasya managed to slip in and stayed to listen.  \n\nRaskolnikov was almost back to normal compared to the day before, but he still looked pale and drained. He resembled someone who had been through a serious ordeal. His brows were furrowed, his lips tight, and his eyes had a feverish gleam. He barely spoke, and when he did, it felt like a chore. He moved restlessly, as if he couldn’t settle down.  \n\nHe looked like he needed a sling or a bandage to really sell the image of someone with a painful injury. When his mother and sister walked in, his face lit up for a moment, but it only added to his overall look of suffering instead of lifting his spirits. That brief spark faded quickly, leaving behind a lingering expression of pain. Zossimov, eager and observant like a young doctor just starting out, noticed that Raskolnikov showed no joy at his mother’s arrival.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov appears physically better but remains emotionally tormented and listless despite the presence of his mother and sister."
