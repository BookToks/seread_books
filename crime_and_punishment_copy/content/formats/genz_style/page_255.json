He’s got a family: a wife, kids, and a daughter. It’ll take ages to get him to the hospital, but there’s definitely a doctor at his house. I’ll pay! I’ll pay! At least he’ll get help right away. Otherwise, he might die before you even get him to the hospital.” He discreetly slipped something into the cop’s hand. It was legit, and help was closer here. They lifted the injured man, and others jumped in to help.\n\nKozel’s house was just thirty yards away. Raskolnikov walked behind, carefully supporting Marmeladov’s head and guiding the way. “This way, this way! We need to take him upstairs headfirst. Turn around! I’ll pay, I promise it’ll be worth it,” he muttered.\n\nMeanwhile, Katerina Ivanovna was pacing her tiny room, as she often did, moving from the window to the stove and back, arms crossed, talking to herself and coughing. Lately, she’d been chatting even more with her oldest daughter, Polenka, who was ten. Polenka didn’t get everything, but she understood her mom needed her, so she watched closely with her big, smart eyes, trying hard to seem like she understood. Right then, Polenka was helping her little brother undress. He’d been sick all day and was getting ready for bed.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov urgently seeks help for an injured man, emphasizing the need for immediate care at a nearby house."
