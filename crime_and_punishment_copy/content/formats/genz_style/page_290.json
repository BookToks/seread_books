  "text": "At last, we’re on the right track, while Pyotr Petrovitch is totally lost. I’ve called them all sorts of names, but I respect them, kinda. Except for Zametov—I just think he’s a bit of a puppy. Zossimov? He’s solid. Honest and knows his stuff. But enough of that. Is it all forgiven? Let’s move on. \n\nI know this corridor. Been here before—there was a scandal at Number 3. Where are you? Number eight? Lock yourselves in for the night. Don’t let anyone in. I’ll be back in about fifteen minutes with news and then Zossimov will follow. Trust me! Gotta go! \n\n“Good heavens, Dounia, what’s going to happen?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked, looking worried.\n\n“Don’t stress, Mom,” Dounia said, taking off her hat and cape. “God sent this guy to help us, even if he just came from a drinking party. We can count on him, I promise. He’s done a lot for Rodya…”\n\n“Oh, Dounia, who knows if he’ll even show up! I can’t stand leaving Rodya like this. I imagined our reunion would be so different! He looked so gloomy, like he didn’t even want to see us…”\n\nTears filled her eyes.\n\n“No, it’s not that, Mom. You were crying the whole time. He’s just really shaken up from being seriously ill—that’s all.” \n\n“Oh, that illness! What’s going to happen?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia reassures her mother that a gentleman from a drinking party will help them, despite their worries about Rodya's condition."
