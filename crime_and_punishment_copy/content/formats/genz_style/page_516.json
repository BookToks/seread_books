  "text": "“It’s all lies and nonsense!” Lebeziatnikov shouted, clearly uncomfortable with the topic. “It wasn’t like that at all. You got it wrong; it’s slander. I was just defending myself. She came at me first, scratching and pulling my whiskers. I mean, isn’t it okay to defend yourself? I don’t let anyone use violence on me—it's just wrong. So, I pushed her back.”\n\n“He-he-he!” Luzhin cackled, enjoying the drama. “You’re just acting like this because you’re in a bad mood. But this is nonsense and has nothing to do with the whole woman issue! You don’t get it. I used to think if women are equal to men in everything, even strength (which people say now), then fighting should be equal too. But then I realized that fighting shouldn’t even be a thing. In the future, it won’t exist, and looking for equality in fighting is just weird. I’m not that clueless… but sure, fighting happens now. It won’t later, but right now, it does… ugh, you make everything so confusing! \n\nThat’s not why I’m not going. I’m skipping it on principle, not wanting to be part of those ridiculous memorial dinners! Though, I could go just to laugh at it… too bad there won’t be any priests there. I’d definitely go if there were.” \n\n“Then you’d just sit at someone else’s table and insult it and the people who invited you. Right?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Lebeziatnikov defends his actions against a woman while discussing the complexities of gender equality and societal conventions."
