  "text": "Katerina Ivanovna was losing it. She tried to explain to the kids why they had to sing, but when they didnâ€™t get it, she snapped and started hitting them. ðŸ˜Ÿ Then sheâ€™d charge at the crowd. If she spotted someone well-dressed watching, sheâ€™d beg them to see how these kids from a fancy family had ended up like this. When people laughed or mocked, sheâ€™d go right at them, ready to argue. Some folks chuckled, others frowned, but everyone was drawn to the scene of this frantic woman and her scared kids.\n\nRaskolnikov didnâ€™t see the frying pan Lebeziatnikov mentioned, but Katerina didnâ€™t need it. Instead, she clapped her bony hands to make Lida and Kolya dance while Polenka sang. She joined in too, but her voice cracked on the second note, and a harsh cough made her curse and cry. What really set her off was seeing Kolya and Lida terrified and crying. \n\nThey tried to dress the kids up like street performers. Kolya wore a turban made of red and white fabric to look like a Turk. Lida had on a red knitted capâ€”more like a nightcap from Marmeladovâ€”with a broken piece of white ostrich feather that had been in the family for ages. Polenka was in her usual clothes, looking confused and scared, staying close to her mom and hiding her tears. She sensed something was off with her mother and glanced around nervously.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna desperately tries to make her children perform in the streets, driven by her madness and despair."
