  "text": "\"Crime and Punishment\"\n\n\"You're not cut out for this job. Why not just shoot yourself? Or is that not your vibe?\"\n\n\"Are you trying to get under my skin? Make me leave?\"\n\n\"What a strange guy! Anyway, welcome to the staircase. That’s the way to Sofya Semyonovna. No one’s home, I swear. Don’t believe me? Ask Kapernaumov. She leaves the key with him. Speaking of which, here’s Madame de Kapernaumov. Hey, what’s up? She’s a bit hard of hearing. Is she out? Did you catch that? She’s not around and probably won’t be until late tonight. \n\nSo, want to come to my room? You wanted to see me, right? Here we are. Madame Resslich isn’t home either. She’s always busy, a solid person, trust me. She could’ve helped you if you’d been a bit smarter.\n\nAnyway, check this out! I’m pulling this five-percent bond from the bureau—look at how many I have! This one’s getting cashed today. I can’t waste time. The bureau’s locked, the flat’s locked, and here we are back on the stairs. Should we grab a cab? I’m heading to the Islands. Want a ride? I’ll take this carriage. \n\nOh, you’re passing? Tired of it all? Come on, let’s go for a drive! Looks like it might rain. No worries, we can put the hood down….\"\n\nSvidrigaïlov was already in the carriage. Raskolnikov figured his suspicions were off for now. Without saying a word, he turned and walked back toward the Hay Market. If he had just glanced back, he might have seen Svidrigaïlov hop out a short distance away, wave off the cab, and stroll down the sidewalk. But he turned the corner and missed it all.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, feeling disgusted, distances himself from Svidrigaïlov, suspecting his intentions regarding his sister."
