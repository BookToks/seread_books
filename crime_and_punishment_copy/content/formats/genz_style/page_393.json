  "text": "The quieter the moonlight, the harder his heart pounded, to the point of pain. And it was completely silent. Then he heard a sharp crack, like a splinter breaking, and everything went still again. A fly buzzed against the window, sounding desperate. That’s when he noticed something hanging in the corner between the window and the cupboard—a cloak. “Why is that here?” he wondered. It wasn’t there before.\n\nHe crept closer and sensed someone hiding behind it. Carefully, he moved the cloak and saw the old woman hunched over in a chair, her face hidden. It was her. He towered over her. “She’s scared,” he thought. Quietly, he grabbed the axe from the noose and swung it at her skull—once, then again. But oddly, she didn’t move, like she was made of wood. Fear gripped him as he leaned in to see her face, but she just bent down lower. He crouched down to peek up at her, and a chill ran through him: she was sitting there, laughing silently, shaking with laughter, trying hard not to make a sound.\n\nSuddenly, he thought he heard the bedroom door creak open, with laughter and whispering coming from inside. Panic hit him, and he started swinging the axe at the old woman’s head with all his strength. But with every blow, the laughter and whispers from the bedroom grew louder, and the old woman just kept shaking with laughter. He tried to escape, but the hallway was packed with people, and the apartment doors were wide open.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, in a state of panic and frenzy, attacks an old woman with an axe, but is haunted by her laughter and the sounds from the bedroom."
