  "text": "As soon as they split up, each couldn't stop thinking about the other. Sonia remembered what Svidrigaïlov had told her: Raskolnikov had two choices—Siberia or something else. She also knew he struggled with pride and doubt. \n\n\"Does he really only have cowardice and fear of death keeping him alive?\" she thought, feeling hopeless.\n\nMeanwhile, the sun was setting. Sonia stood there, feeling down, staring out the window at the dull, blank wall of the next building. Just when she began to fear he might be dead, he walked in.\n\nShe gasped in joy, but then her heart sank as she looked closely at his face.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Raskolnikov said with a smile. \"I came for your cross, Sonia. You told me to go to the cross-roads. Why are you scared now that it's happening?\" \n\nSonia was shocked. His tone felt off; a chill ran through her. But she quickly realized he was putting on a front. He avoided her gaze as he spoke.\n\n\"Listen, Sonia, I've decided this is the way to go. There's something important... but it’s a long story, and we don’t need to get into it. What really ticks me off? Those clueless faces staring at me, bombarding me with dumb questions that I’ll have to answer—they’ll be pointing at me... Ugh! I’m not going to Porfiry. I’m done with him. I’d rather see my buddy, the Explosive Lieutenant.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov visits Sonia, expressing his decision to confront his fate while revealing his inner turmoil and disdain for societal judgment."
