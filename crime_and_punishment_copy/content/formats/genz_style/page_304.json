  "text": "At nine o’clock sharp, Razumihin arrived at Bakaleyev’s place. The two ladies were waiting for him, super anxious. They had been up since seven or even earlier. He walked in looking really gloomy, awkwardly bowed, and instantly felt mad at himself for it. He didn’t see this coming: Pulcheria Alexandrovna rushed at him, grabbed his hands, and nearly kissed them. \n\nHe stole a glance at Avdotya Romanovna. Instead of the usual sneers he expected, her face showed real gratitude and respect. It threw him off even more than if she had insulted him. Luckily, there was something to talk about, so he jumped on that.\n\nWhen Pulcheria Alexandrovna heard everything was going well and that Rodya was still asleep, she was relieved. She said she needed to discuss something super important first. Then she asked about breakfast and invited him to join them. They had been waiting to eat with him. Avdotya rang the bell, and a scruffy waiter finally showed up to take their order. The tea came, but it was served in such a messy way that the ladies felt embarrassed. \n\nRazumihin started to dive into the details of the place, but then he remembered Luzhin and felt awkward. Thankfully, Pulcheria Alexandrovna kept firing questions at him, which helped ease the tension. He talked for about thirty minutes straight.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin visits the ladies at Bakaleyev's house, where he is met with unexpected gratitude and a desire to discuss important matters."
