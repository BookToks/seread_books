  "text": "Avdotya Romanovna was curious as she looked at Razumihin; her dark eyes sparkled. Razumihin was taken aback by her gaze. \n\nPulcheria Alexandrovna felt overwhelmed. “I’m not going anywhere,” she whispered to Razumihin, filled with despair. “I’ll stay here and make sure Dounia gets home safe.”\n\n“You’re going to ruin everything,” Razumihin replied, whispering back, losing his patience. “Just come out to the stairs. Nastasya, can you turn on the light? Listen, he almost went after the doctor and me this afternoon! Do you get it? Even the doctor gave up and left him alone to avoid making things worse. I stayed downstairs to keep watch, but he got dressed and snuck out. He’ll do it again if you push him tonight, and it could end badly…”\n\n“What are you talking about?” \n\n“And Avdotya Romanovna can’t be left in that place without you. Seriously, think about where you’re staying! That jerk Pyotr Petrovitch couldn’t find you a worse spot… But hey, I’ve had a bit to drink, so I might be rambling; just ignore me…”\n\n“I’ll go talk to the landlady,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna insisted. “I’ll ask her to find a place for Dounia and me for the night. I can’t leave him like this, I just can’t!” \n\nThis chat happened on the landing right outside the landlady’s door. Nastasya lit the way from a step below. Razumihin was super worked up.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin urges Pulcheria Alexandrovna to leave Raskolnikov alone for the night to avoid further irritation."
