  "text": "Marfa Petrovna reminded him that he was the head of the family and called him out for tormenting a defenseless girl who was already struggling. Honestly, dear Rodya, the letter was so beautifully written that it made me cry when I read it, and I still tear up every time. Plus, the servants backed up Douniaâ€™s story; they knew way more than Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov thoughtâ€”classic servant insight, right? ðŸ˜… Marfa Petrovna was totally shocked and felt \"crushed,\" but she became convinced of Douniaâ€™s innocence.\n\nThe next day, Sunday, she went straight to the Cathedral, knelt down, and prayed with tears, asking Our Lady for strength to handle this new challenge and to do what was right. After that, she rushed over to us, told us everything, cried a lot, and sincerely asked Dounia to forgive her. That same morning, she hit the town, going door to door, shedding tears, and praising Douniaâ€™s character and actions. She even showed everyone Douniaâ€™s letter to Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov and let them make copiesâ€”which I think was a bit much. For days, she was busy driving around town because some people felt slighted about who got attention first. So, she had to rotate visits, making sure everyone got their turn.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marfa Petrovna's efforts to clear Dounia's name and restore her reputation lead to her public repentance and acknowledgment of Dounia's innocence."
