  "text": "The doctor walked in, a precise little old German guy, looking around like he was on edge. He approached the sick man, checked his pulse, felt his head, and with Katerina Ivanovna's help, he unbuttoned the blood-soaked shirt to reveal the injured man’s chest. It was a mess—gashes, crush injuries, and broken ribs on the right side. On the left, over the heart, there was a nasty yellowish-black bruise—a brutal kick from a horse. The doctor frowned. The cop explained that the man got caught in the wheel and was dragged for thirty yards.\n\n“It’s amazing he’s even conscious,” the doctor whispered to Raskolnikov. \n\n“What do you think?” Raskolnikov asked.\n\n“He will die right away.”\n\n“Is there really no hope?”\n\n“Not a chance! He’s on his last breath... His head is messed up too... Hm... I could bleed him if you want, but it won’t help. He’s going to die in the next five or ten minutes.”\n\n“Then let’s bleed him.”\n\n“If that’s what you want... Just know it’s completely pointless.”\n\nJust then, more footsteps were heard. The crowd in the hallway parted, and a little gray priest showed up, carrying the sacrament. A cop had gone to fetch him after the accident. The doctor switched places with the priest, exchanging looks. Raskolnikov asked the doctor to stay a bit longer. He shrugged and hung around.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The doctor assesses a critically injured man, revealing that he is unlikely to survive due to severe injuries."
