  "text": "\"I can’t spill all the tea, haha! But seriously, think about the perks. Confessing now would totally cut down your sentence. Another guy’s already taken the fall, which messes up the whole case. Just think about that! I promise, your confession will catch everyone off guard. We’ll clear up all those psychological doubts. Your crime will look like a total slip-up, which, let’s be real, it kinda was. I’m a straight shooter, Rodion, and I’ll keep my promise.\"\n\nRaskolnikov stayed quiet, looking down. He thought for a while, then managed a sad smile. \"No! I don’t care about a lighter sentence.\"\n\n\"That’s exactly what I was worried about!\" Porfiry exclaimed, sounding genuinely concerned. \"I feared you wouldn’t care about easing your punishment.\"\n\nRaskolnikov shot him a sad look. \"Don’t underestimate life!\" Porfiry urged. \"You still have a lot ahead of you. How can you say you don’t want a lighter sentence? You’re too impatient!\"\n\n\"A lot of what’s ahead?\" Raskolnikov asked.\n\n\"Life! What kind of prophet are you? Do you really know what’s coming? Seek and you’ll find. Maybe this is God’s way of guiding you. And this situation isn’t forever…\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry encourages Raskolnikov to confess, suggesting it could lessen his sentence and lead to redemption, but Raskolnikov expresses indifference towards mitigating his punishment."
