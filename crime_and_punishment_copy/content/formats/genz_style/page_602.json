  "text": "Katerina Ivanovna was on a roll, almost in tears but still talking non-stop. She pointed at the crying kids and Raskolnikov tried to convince her to head home. He even tried a compliment, saying it wasn’t right for her to be out in the streets like an organ-grinder (a street performer), especially since she wanted to run a boarding school.\n\n“A boarding school? Ha! What a joke!” Katerina laughed, but it turned into a cough. “That dream’s dead! Everyone’s abandoned us! You know that general? I threw an inkpot at him! It was just sitting there in the waiting room. I signed my name, chucked it at him, and bolted. Ugh, those scoundrels! But I’m done with them. I’ll take care of the kids myself! No more bowing down to anyone!” She pointed at Sonia. “She’s done enough for us!”\n\n“Polenka, how much do you have? Show me!” she demanded. “What? Only two farthings? Those mean people give us nothing, just chase us and stick their tongues out. Look at that idiot laughing!” (She pointed at a guy in the crowd.) “It’s all Kolya’s fault; he’s such a pain. What do you want, Polenka? Tell me in French, parlez-moi français. I taught you some phrases! You need to show you’re from a good family, well-raised, not like those other organ-grinders. We’re not doing a puppet show here!” 🎭\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna expresses her despair over their situation while insisting on providing for her children despite the challenges they face."
