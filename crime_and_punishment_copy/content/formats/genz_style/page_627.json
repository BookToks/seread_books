I cough, my throat tickles, and breathing gets tough. I’m such a coward. I went to Dr. B——n recently. He gives each patient at least half an hour. He laughed at me and said, ‘Tobacco’s bad for you; your lungs are messed up.’ But how can I give it up? What’s the alternative? I don’t drink, which is part of the problem, ha-ha! Everything’s relative, Rodion Romanovitch!”  \n\n“Ugh, he’s at it again with his doctor talk,” Raskolnikov thought, feeling disgusted. Memories of their last meeting flooded back, bringing a wave of that same feeling he had then.  \n\n“I came to see you the day before yesterday, in the evening. You didn’t know?” Porfiry continued, glancing around the room. “I walked into this very room. I was passing by, just like today, and thought I’d drop by. Your door was wide open, so I peeked in, waited a bit, and then left without saying anything to your servant. Don’t you lock your door?”  \n\nRaskolnikov’s expression darkened more and more. Porfiry seemed to sense his mood.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry Petrovitch expresses his struggle with quitting smoking while visiting Raskolnikov, who feels increasingly uneasy during the conversation."
