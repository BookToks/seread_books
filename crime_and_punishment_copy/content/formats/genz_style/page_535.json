  "text": "Katerina Ivanovna was all about boosting people’s egos. When she praised someone’s connections or wealth, it was totally genuine—she just wanted to make them feel important. But then there was that loser Lebeziatnikov who didn’t show up either. Seriously, what did he think he was? He was only invited because he shared a room with Pyotr Petrovitch and was his friend. It would’ve been awkward not to include him.\n\nAlso missing were the fancy lady and her old-maid daughter, who had just moved in two weeks ago. They’d complained a bunch about the noise in Katerina Ivanovna’s room, especially when Marmeladov stumbled in drunk. Katerina heard about it from Amalia Ivanovna, who was in a fight with her and threatened to kick them all out. Amalia yelled that they weren’t even worth the trouble of the “honorable” lodgers they were disturbing.\n\nSo, Katerina decided to invite that lady and her daughter—who she felt were too good for her—to show she was above all that petty drama. She wanted them to see she was classy and didn’t hold grudges. During dinner, she planned to drop hints about her late father’s important job and make it clear that it was pretty dumb of them to snub her when they crossed paths.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna invites her haughty neighbors to dinner to demonstrate her nobility and disinterest in malice despite their disdain."
