  "text": "Raskolnikov was trying to keep up with Ilya Petrovitch, who was rambling on after a meal. Most of what he said felt like noise to Raskolnikov, but a few things caught his attention. He raised his eyebrows, curious about where this was going.\n\nIlya Petrovitch kept talking, calling certain women “crop-headed wenches” (his term for midwives). He thought it was a funny nickname. “They go to the Academy and study anatomy. If I get sick, should I really call a young lady to treat me? What do you think? Ha-ha!” He laughed, clearly proud of his joke. \n\nHe went on about how people are obsessed with education, but once you have it, that should be enough. “Why throw shade at good people, like that jerk Zametov does? Why insult me?” \n\nThen he shifted to a darker topic: suicides. “They’re happening all the time! People spend their last coin and just end it all—young, old, everyone. Just this morning, we heard about a guy who just moved here.” \n\n“Nil Pavlitch, what was that guy’s name who shot himself?” \n\nFrom another room, someone answered lazily, “Svidrigaïlov.” \n\nRaskolnikov jolted. “Svidrigaïlov! He shot himself!” \n\n“Wait, do you know Svidrigaïlov?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is startled to learn about Svidrigaïlov's suicide, indicating a connection or concern for the man."
