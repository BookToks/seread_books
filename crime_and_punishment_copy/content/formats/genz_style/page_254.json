It was clear the carriage belonged to someone wealthy and important, and the police were anxious not to mess up the situation. All they needed to do was get the injured guy to the station and then to the hospital. No one even knew his name.\n\nMeanwhile, Raskolnikov squeezed through the crowd and leaned closer. The lantern suddenly lit up the unfortunate guy’s face. He recognized him.\n\n“I know him! I know him!” he shouted, pushing to the front. “It’s Marmeladov, a retired government clerk. He lives nearby in Kozel’s house. Hurry, get a doctor! I’ll pay, see?” He pulled out money to show the policeman, clearly agitated.\n\nThe police were relieved to find out who the man was. Raskolnikov gave them his name and address and, with all the urgency of a family member, begged them to take Marmeladov to his place right away.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov recognizes the injured man, Marmeladov, and urgently insists on getting him medical help while offering to pay for it."
