I need to talk to you for a sec.” He suddenly turned back to Razumihin. “You know that guy… what’s his name… Porfiry Petrovitch?”\n\n“Of course! He’s family. Why?” Razumihin asked, intrigued.\n\n“He’s handling that murder case, right? You mentioned it yesterday.”\n\n“Yeah… so?” Razumihin’s eyes widened.\n\n“He’s been asking about people who pawned stuff. I’ve got some things there too—just small stuff, like a ring my sister gave me when I left home and my dad’s silver watch. They’re not worth much—maybe five or six roubles—but they mean a lot to me. What should I do now? I really don’t want to lose them, especially the watch. It’s the only thing we have left from Dad. Mom would freak if she knew it was gone. You know how women are. So, what do I do? I know I should’ve reported it to the police, but wouldn’t it be better to go straight to Porfiry? What do you think? Mom might ask for it before dinner.”\n\n“Definitely not the police! Go to Porfiry,” Razumihin exclaimed, clearly excited. “I’m so glad! Let’s go now. It’s just a short walk. We’ll definitely find him.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia expresses concern about losing her father's watch and seeks advice on how to retrieve her pawned items without alarming her mother."
