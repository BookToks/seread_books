  "text": "Raskolnikov quickly slipped back into his flat, shutting the door behind him. He quietly hooked it shut, relying on instinct. Once secure, he crouched by the door, holding his breath. The visitor was now right outside, mirroring the moment he had just shared with the old woman when he listened through the door.\n\nThe stranger was panting. “Must be a big guy,” Raskolnikov thought, gripping the axe tightly. It felt surreal. The visitor yanked the bell, making it ring loudly.\n\nAs soon as the bell chimed, Raskolnikov sensed movement in the room. He listened intently. The stranger rang again, then yanked hard on the door handle. Raskolnikov watched in horror as the hook shook, fearing it might come loose. It felt like it could happen any second. He thought about holding the hook in place but worried the visitor might notice. A wave of dizziness hit him—“I’m going to pass out!”—but then the visitor spoke, snapping him back to reality.\n\n“What’s going on? Are they asleep or what? Damn them!” he shouted in a thick voice. “Hey, Alyona Ivanovna, you old witch! Lizaveta Ivanovna, my beauty! Open the door! Are they dead or just snoozing?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov hides in fear as an unknown visitor aggressively attempts to enter the flat, heightening his anxiety and tension."
