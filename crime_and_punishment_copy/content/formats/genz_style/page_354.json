  "text": "Raskolnikov was still chuckling, shaking hands with Porfiry Petrovitch, trying not to go overboard with the laughter. He was waiting for the right moment to wrap it up. Razumihin, totally embarrassed after knocking over the table and breaking a glass, stared gloomily at the mess. He cursed under his breath and turned to the window, sulking with his back to everyone, looking furious but not really seeing anything. \n\nPorfiry Petrovitch kept laughing, clearly wanting some answers. Zametov, who had been chilling in the corner, stood up when the visitors walked in. He wore a surprised smile but looked a bit awkward, especially around Raskolnikov. This unexpected presence made Raskolnikov uneasy.\n\n“I need to think about this,” he thought. “Excuse me,” he said, trying to act super embarrassed. “Raskolnikov.”\n\n“Not a problem! Great to see you… and what a nice entrance you made! Why won’t he even say good morning?” Porfiry nodded at Razumihin.\n\n“I honestly don’t know why he’s so mad at me. I just said he looked like Romeo… and I even proved it! That’s all!” \n\n“Pig!” Razumihin snapped without turning around.\n\n“There must be a serious reason for his rage if he’s that upset over a compliment,” Porfiry joked.\n\n“Oh, you clever lawyer! … Forget you all!” Razumihin shot back, then suddenly burst into laughter himself.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov and Razumihin navigate a humorous yet awkward social encounter with Porfiry Petrovitch and Zametov, highlighting their contrasting emotions."
