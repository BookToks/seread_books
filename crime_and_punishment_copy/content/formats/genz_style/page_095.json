  "text": "“Okay, I’ll come,” Lizaveta said, still thinking it over, and she started to walk away slowly. \n\nRaskolnikov had just passed by and didn’t catch any more of the conversation. He moved quietly, trying to hear every word. At first, he felt shocked, but then a wave of horror hit him, like a chill down his spine. He had just found out, totally out of the blue, that the next day at seven o’clock, Lizaveta, the old woman’s sister and only friend, would be out. That meant the old woman would be alone at exactly seven. \n\nHe was just a few steps from his place. He walked in like someone facing a death sentence. His mind was blank; he couldn’t think. But deep down, he felt it—he had lost his freedom to think, lost his will. Everything felt suddenly decided and irreversible. \n\nIf he had to wait years for the perfect moment, he couldn’t have asked for a better opportunity than what had just come up. It would’ve been hard to find a safer and more certain way to know that the old woman, the target of his plan, would be home alone at that exact time.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov realizes that Lizaveta will be away the next day, leaving the old woman alone, which solidifies his plan for murder."
