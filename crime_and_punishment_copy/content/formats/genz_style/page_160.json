  "text": "Another idea hit him. \"Why not just ditch it in the Neva? Or better yet, head out to the Islands and hide it somewhere remote, like in a forest or under a bush?\" He thought that sounded smart, even if his brain was a bit foggy. But fate had other plans.\n\nAs he left V—— Prospect and headed toward the square, he spotted a narrow passage between two blank walls leading to a courtyard. On the right was a dirty, unpainted wall of a four-story building stretching deep into the yard. To the left, a wooden fence ran for about twenty paces before turning sharply. \n\nThis was a deserted area filled with trash. At the back, a grimy stone shed peeked out from behind the fence. It looked like it belonged to a carriage or carpentry shop; the whole place was coated in coal dust. \"This could be the perfect spot to dump it,\" he thought. \n\nNoticing no one around, he slipped in. Near the gate, he saw a sink, like the ones found in yards for workers or cab drivers. Above it, someone had scribbled, \"Standing here strictly forbidden\" in chalk. Perfect—no one would think twice about him being there. \"I can just toss everything in a pile and bounce!\" \n\nHe looked around again, hand already in his pocket, and spotted a large, uncut stone against the outer wall, right between the entrance and the sink.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist contemplates hiding incriminating items in a secluded location but ultimately finds a potential spot in a deserted courtyard."
