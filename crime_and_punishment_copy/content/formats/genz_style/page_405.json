I saw her the day of the funeral, right after she was buried. That was the day before I came here. The second time was the day before yesterday, at dawn, while I was at the Malaya Vishera station. The third time was two hours ago, in my room. I was alone.”  \n\n“Were you awake?”  \n“Totally wide awake. Every single time. She comes, talks to me for a minute, and then leaves through the door—always through the door. I can almost hear her.”  \n\n“Something made me think you might be going through this,” Raskolnikov suddenly said, surprised he even spoke up. He felt a rush of excitement.  \n\n“What? You thought so?” Svidrigaïlov asked, shocked. “Didn’t I tell you there’s something connecting us?”  \n“You never said that!” Raskolnikov shot back, heated.  \n“Didn’t I?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov claims to have seen the ghost of Marfa Petrovna multiple times since her funeral, which intrigues Raskolnikov."
