A useless, disgusting, harmful bug.’  \n‘A human being—a louse!’  \n‘I know it wasn’t just a louse,’ he said, looking at her with wild eyes. ‘But I’ve been rambling, Sonia. I’ve been talking nonsense for ages. You’re right; there were way deeper reasons for this! I haven’t talked to anyone in so long… My head is pounding now.’  \n\nHis eyes were shining with a feverish glow. He was almost out of it; a strange smile flickered on his lips. You could see his exhaustion through his excitement. Sonia noticed how much he was suffering. She was starting to feel dizzy too. He was speaking in a way that was sort of understandable, but still… ‘But how, how! Oh my God!’ She wrung her hands in despair.  \n\n‘No, Sonia, that’s not it,’ he suddenly said, lifting his head as if a new thought had hit him—‘that’s not it! Imagine this: I’m vain, jealous, mean, petty, spiteful, and maybe a bit insane. (Let’s just lay it all out there! People have already hinted at madness, you know.) I told you I couldn’t stay at the university. But maybe I could have? My mom would have sent me money for the fees, and I could’ve earned enough for clothes, boots, and food, for sure.’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist reflects on his mental state and the underlying causes of his turmoil, revealing his feelings of exhaustion and despair."
