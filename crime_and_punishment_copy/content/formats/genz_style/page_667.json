(I might be drinking a lot of wine and rambling right now.) \n\nI hope you don’t mind me saying this, but I started to have the same effect on Avdotya Romanovna. But I messed it up because I was too stupid and impatient. There were times when my look really freaked her out—like, it got intense and she hated it. No need to get into the details, but we ended up parting ways. I acted dumb again, making fun of all the attempts to change my mind. Then Parasha showed up, and it turned into a whole drama. \n\nAh, Rodion Romanovitch, you should see how your sister’s eyes can light up sometimes! Forget that I’m tipsy right now; I’m being real. Her gaze has haunted my dreams, and even the sound of her dress drove me wild. I honestly thought I might lose it. I never imagined I could feel this way.
