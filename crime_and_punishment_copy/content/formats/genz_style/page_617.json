  "text": "Raskolnikov felt that familiar unease creeping back, like a nagging conscience. “Is this really what I should be doing?” he thought, listening to the singing. But it wasn’t just that—it was something deeper, something he couldn’t quite grasp. It felt like a messy knot he couldn’t untie. “No, I’d rather face the struggle again! Bring on Porfiry or Svidrigaïlov. I need a challenge, a fight. Yes!” With that, he bolted out of the tavern, almost running. The thought of Dounia and his mom hit him hard, sending him into a mini panic.\n\nThat night, he found himself waking up in some bushes on Krestovsky Island, shaking with fever. He made his way home and finally got back by early morning. After a few hours of sleep, the fever faded, but he woke up late—around two in the afternoon.\n\nHe remembered that Katerina Ivanovna’s funeral was happening that day and felt a strange relief that he wasn’t there. Nastasya brought him food, and he devoured it with a surprising hunger. His head felt clearer, and he was calmer than he had been in days. He even found it odd how panicked he had been before.\n\nThen, the door swung open, and Razumihin walked in. “Oh good, he’s eating—so he’s not sick,” Razumihin said, taking a seat across from Raskolnikov. He looked worried and didn’t hide it. He spoke with clear annoyance but kept his voice steady. It was obvious he had something on his mind.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a mix of unease and relief as he grapples with his conscience and the impending funeral of Katerina Ivanovna."
