No… You’re marrying Luzhin for my sake. I won’t let that happen. Just write him a letter to break it off before tomorrow. I’ll read it in the morning, and that’ll be that!” \n\n“I can’t do that!” Dounia shot back, hurt. “What right do you have to tell me…?”\n\n“Dounia, chill out! Just listen. Tomorrow…” their mother interjected, clearly worried. “Let’s just leave!”\n\n“He’s out of it,” Razumihin said, a bit tipsy. “How else would he even say that? Tomorrow, this nonsense will be over. He definitely sent Luzhin packing today. Luzhin got all huffy, trying to show off, and left all bummed out…”\n\n“Is that true?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna gasped.\n\n“See you tomorrow, brother,” Dounia said with sympathy. “Let’s go, Mom… Bye, Rodya.”\n\n“Wait, sister!” he called after them, making one last push. “I’m not losing it; this marriage is a disaster. I might be a jerk, but you shouldn’t be one too. One scoundrel is enough. It’s me or Luzhin! Just go now…”\n\n“But you’ve lost it! Tyrant!” Razumihin yelled. But Raskolnikov didn’t respond. He just flopped down on the sofa, facing the wall, completely drained.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov insists that his sister Dounia should refuse her marriage to Luzhin, viewing it as a sacrifice he cannot accept."
