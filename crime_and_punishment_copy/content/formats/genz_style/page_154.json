  "text": "Raskolnikov felt like he was being sentenced to death, but he didn’t even flinch. Something new and intense was hitting him. He realized he could never again pour his heart out to these police officers like he just did. Even if they were family, it wouldn’t matter. It was a weird and terrifying feeling—more of a gut punch than a thought. It was the most painful sensation he’d ever experienced.\n\nThe head clerk started dictating the usual form: he couldn’t pay, he promised to do so later, he wouldn’t leave town or sell his stuff, and so on.\n\n“But you can’t even hold the pen,” the head clerk said, eyeing Raskolnikov with curiosity. “Are you sick?”\n\n“Yeah, I feel dizzy. Just keep going!” \n\n“That’s it. Sign here.”\n\nThe clerk took the paper and moved on to other tasks. Raskolnikov handed back the pen, but instead of leaving, he slumped over the table, resting his head in his hands. It felt like a nail was being driven into his skull. Suddenly, a strange idea popped into his mind.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences an intense and agonizing realization that he can no longer appeal to the police officers with emotional pleas, feeling a profound sense of isolation."
