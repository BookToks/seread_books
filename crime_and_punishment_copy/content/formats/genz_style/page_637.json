  "text": "‘No way, Rodion Romanovitch, Nikolay isn’t coming in! This is wild and dark stuff, a modern mess. It’s when people’s hearts are heavy, and they talk about how blood “renews.” Everyone’s chasing comfort like it’s the meaning of life. \n\nWe’re stuck in these bookish dreams, with a heart all messed up from theories. Here’s a guy who resolves to commit a crime, but it’s not like a normal decision. It’s more like jumping off a cliff or leaping from a bell tower—his legs were shaking as he went to do it. He forgot to shut the door behind him and killed two people for some abstract idea. \n\nAfter the murder, he couldn’t even take the money. He grabbed what he could and hid it under a stone. He was in agony, listening to them knock and ring the bell, but instead of facing it, he went to an empty room, half out of his mind, wanting to relive that cold shiver of fear. Sure, he was sick, but think about this: he’s a murderer but sees himself as a good guy, looks down on others, and acts like he’s the victim. That’s not what a Nikolay would do, my dear Rodion Romanovitch!’\n\nEverything said before felt like a confession, but this hit hard. Raskolnikov felt like he’d been stabbed. \n\n‘So… who’s the real murderer then?’ he asked, breathless and unable to hold back.\n\nPorfiry Petrovitch leaned back, surprised by the question. \n\n‘Who is the murderer?’ he echoed, as if he couldn’t believe it.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov grapples with his guilt and identity as a murderer while reflecting on the complexities of his actions and theories."
