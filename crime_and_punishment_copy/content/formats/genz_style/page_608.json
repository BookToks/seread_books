I’ve never been in your room before.” \n\nShe looked at Sonia, clearly in pain. \n\n“We’ve ruined you, Sonia. Polenka, Lida, Kolya, come here! Here they are, Sonia, take them all! I’m done! The party’s over.” (Cough!) “Just let me lie down and die in peace.” \n\nThey gently laid her back on the pillow. \n\n“What about the priest? I don’t want him. You don’t have a rouble to spare. I have no sins. God can forgive me without that. He knows how much I’ve suffered… And if He doesn’t forgive me, whatever!” \n\nShe slipped deeper into a restless delirium.

What more do you want? What nonsense!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna, in a state of delirium and suffering, expresses her despair and resignation while entrusting her children to Sonia."
