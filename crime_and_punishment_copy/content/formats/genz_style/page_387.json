  "text": "Raskolnikov stood still, watching the man walk away without a glance back. After a moment, the guy turned around from about fifty paces away and looked back at him. Raskolnikov couldnâ€™t see clearly, but he thought he caught that same cold, triumphant smile. ðŸ˜’\n\nWith shaky knees, he slowly made his way back to his tiny room, feeling a chill run through him. He took off his cap and set it on the table, standing still for ten minutes. Finally, he sank onto the sofa, letting out a weak groan. He lay there for half an hour, not really thinking about anything.\n\nThoughts drifted through his mindâ€”random faces from childhood, a church belfry, a billiard table with some officers playing, the smell of cigars from a tobacco shop, a dark, messy back staircase covered in dirty water and egg shells, and the sound of church bells ringing in the distance. These images swirled around like a storm. Some he liked and tried to hold onto, but they slipped away. There was a weight inside him, but it wasnâ€™t too heavyâ€”sometimes it even felt kind of nice. The slight shivering continued, but that, too, was almost a pleasant feeling. \n\nHe heard Razumihin's hurried footsteps approaching and quickly closed his eyes, pretending to be asleep. Razumihin opened the door.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, feeling cold and exhausted, reflects on fragmented memories and sensations while pretending to sleep as Razumihin approaches."
