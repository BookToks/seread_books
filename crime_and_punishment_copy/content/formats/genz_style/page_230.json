  "text": "Razumihin was just talking about the Palais de Cristal. But what was I looking for again? Oh right, the newspapers. Zosimov mentioned he saw something in them. “Do you have the papers?” he asked as he walked into a spacious, clean restaurant. It was pretty empty, though. A few people were sipping tea, and in another room, four guys were downing champagne. Raskolnikov thought he spotted Zametov among them, but he wasn’t sure. “What if it is?” he wondered.\n\n“Want some vodka?” the waiter asked.\n\n“Just tea, please, and the old papers from the last five days. I’ll tip you.” \n\n“Sure thing, here’s today’s. No vodka?” \n\nThe waiter brought the old newspapers and tea. Raskolnikov sat down and started flipping through them. \n\n“Oh, great… just the usual stuff. An accident on a staircase, a shopkeeper spontaneously combusting from booze, a fire in Peski… another fire in Petersburg… and another one... Ah, here it is!” He finally found what he needed and began reading. The words blurred, but he pushed through, eagerly searching for updates in the next issues. His hands trembled with nervous excitement as he turned the pages. Suddenly, someone plopped down next to him. He looked up to see Zametov, looking just the same, with rings on his fingers, a watch-chain, and perfectly styled, curly black hair.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, in a restaurant, anxiously searches through old newspapers for specific news while observing the people around him."
