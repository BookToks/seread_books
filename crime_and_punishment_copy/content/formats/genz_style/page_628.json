  "text": "\"I need to talk to you, Rodion Romanovitch. I owe you an explanation,\" he said, giving Raskolnikov a light pat on the knee. \n\nBut then, his face changed. A serious, worn-out look took over, and Raskolnikov noticed a hint of sadness he’d never seen before. \n\n\"Last time we met was weird, right? Our first meeting was strange too, but this... it’s different. I think I might have been unfair to you. Remember how we parted? Both of us were a mess—nervous, shaking. Not our finest moment. But we’re gentlemen, and that matters. We should act like it.\" \n\nRaskolnikov thought, \"What’s going on? What does he think of me?\" He looked up at Porfiry, confused. \n\n\"I’ve decided we should be honest with each other,\" Porfiry continued, looking away and avoiding eye contact, like he didn’t want to freak Raskolnikov out or play games anymore. \"These suspicions and awkward moments can’t go on. Nikolay stopped it before it got worse. Can you believe that workman was in the next room?\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry Petrovitch seeks to clarify and address the tension between him and Raskolnikov, acknowledging their previous unseemly behavior and advocating for openness."
