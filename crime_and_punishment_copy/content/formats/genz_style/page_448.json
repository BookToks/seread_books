I’ll figure it out by tomorrow morning… But that’s not why I’m here. I just wanted to say one thing…” \n\nHe finally looked up at her and realized she was standing while he was sitting. \n\n“Why are you standing? Sit down,” he said, his tone shifting to something softer. \n\nShe sat down, and he looked at her with a mix of kindness and pity. \n\n“You’re so thin! Your hand is like… a dead hand, almost transparent.” \n\nHe took her hand gently. Sonia managed a faint smile. \n\n“I’ve always been like this,” she replied. \n\n“Even when you lived at home?” \n\n“Yeah.” \n\n“Of course you were,” he said abruptly, and the expression on his face changed.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov visits Sonia for what he believes may be the last time, expressing concern for her well-being while contemplating his uncertain future."
