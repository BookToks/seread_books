The guy noticed and looked ready to blow up, but then he just shot Raskolnikov a nasty glance and walked away a bit.\n\nThe constable thought for a second. “We can keep her safe from him, but she needs to tell us where to take her. Missy! Hey, missy!” He leaned closer to her.\n\nSuddenly, she opened her eyes wide, focused on him like she realized something important, then got up and started walking back the way she came. “Oh, these awful people, they won’t leave me alone!” she waved her hand in frustration. She moved quickly, though still a bit wobbly. The dandy trailed her but took a different path, keeping her in sight.\n\n“Don’t worry, I won’t let him have her,” the cop said firmly, following them. “Ugh, the things you see these days!” he sighed.\n\nAt that moment, something snapped in Raskolnikov. “Hey, wait!” he yelled at the policeman.\n\nThe cop turned around. “Let them be! What’s it to you? Just let her go! Let him have his fun,” he said, pointing at the dandy. “What does it matter?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses disdain for a man pursuing a vulnerable girl, urging the policeman to let her be."
