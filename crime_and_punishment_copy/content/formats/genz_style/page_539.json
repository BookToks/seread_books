It needed a lot of finesse and care, but she totally messed it up. That clueless, full-of-herself woman, just because she’s the widow of a major and wants to snag a pension, didn’t even bother to show up or respond! Like, come on, basic manners, right? \n\nAnd where is Pyotr Petrovitch? Why hasn’t he shown up? But where’s Sonia? Oh, there she is! Sonia, what took you so long? It’s kinda wild that you’re late even at your dad’s funeral. Rodion Romanovitch, scoot over for her. That’s your spot, Sonia… grab whatever you want. The cold entrée with jelly is the best! They’ll bring the pancakes soon. Have the kids eaten? Polenka, do you have everything? (Cough-cough-cough.) Good job, Lida. And Kolya, stop fidgeting; sit like a gentleman. What’s up, Sonia?”\n\nSonia quickly relayed Pyotr Petrovitch’s apologies, making sure to speak loudly enough for everyone to hear while picking her words carefully. She mentioned that Pyotr Petrovitch specifically asked her to say he’d come by soon to talk business with her and figure out what could be done.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna expresses frustration over the guests at her husband's funeral and is concerned about the absence of certain individuals."
