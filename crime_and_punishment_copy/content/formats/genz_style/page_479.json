So, if I think someone might be a criminal in a case I’m handling… you’re studying law, right, Rodion Romanovitch? \n\n‘Yeah, I was…’\n\n‘Well, this is a good lesson for you—though I won’t pretend to teach you anything after those articles you’ve written about crime! I’m just saying, if I suspect someone of being guilty, why should I stress them out too early, even if I have some evidence? Sometimes I have to arrest someone right away, but other times, the situation is different. So why not let them roam around for a bit? He-he-he! But I see you’re not quite getting it, so let me break it down. If I lock someone up too soon, I might actually give them a boost, you know? He-he! You’re laughing?’\n\nRaskolnikov wasn’t laughing at all. He was sitting there with tight lips, his intense eyes locked on Porfiry Petro-vitch. \n\n‘But that’s true for certain types of people.
