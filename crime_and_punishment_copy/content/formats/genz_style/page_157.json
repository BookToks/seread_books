And you…” Nikodim Fomitch started to say.  \n“Doesn’t matter,” Ilya Petrovitch interrupted, sounding a bit off.  \n\nNikodim Fomitch looked like he wanted to argue but held back when he saw the head clerk staring at him. An awkward silence fell. It was weird.  \n\n“Alright then,” Ilya Petrovitch said, “we won’t keep you.”  \n\nRaskolnikov stepped out. He heard chatter behind him, with Nikodim Fomitch’s voice standing out, asking questions. Once outside, his dizziness faded away.  \n\n“A search—there’s definitely going to be a search,” he thought, rushing home. “They suspect me!”  \n\nHis old fear came rushing back, taking over completely.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, feeling faint and anxious, leaves a tense interrogation where he senses suspicion and anticipates a search at his home."
