  "text": "‘But she’s my landlady!’  \n‘So what if she is?’  \n\nThe head clerk shot him a smug, pitying smile, almost like he was watching a rookie in a tough spot—like, “How’s that working out for you?” But honestly, Raskolnikov didn’t care about an I O U or a legal notice right now. Who had time for that? He stood there, reading, listening, even tossing out questions—totally on autopilot. The rush of feeling safe, like he’d dodged a bullet, filled him up. No thoughts about what’s next, no overthinking, just pure instinctive joy. 🙌  \n\nBut then, chaos erupted in the office. The assistant superintendent, still fuming over Raskolnikov’s earlier disrespect, zeroed in on the poor smart lady, who had been staring at him with a goofy grin.  \n‘You disgraceful hussy!’ he yelled, voice booming. (The lady in mourning had already left.) ‘What was happening at your place last night? Seriously, a total mess again! Fighting and drinking? You want to end up in the house of correction? I’ve warned you ten times! And here you are again, again, you… you…!’  \n\nRaskolnikov dropped the paper from his hands, stunned.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a moment of instinctive joy amidst chaos in the office, contrasting with the assistant superintendent's furious outburst at a lady."
