  "text": "I want to talk to Avdotya Romanovna through you. If you’re cool with it, I’d like to explain that Mr. Luzhin will only bring her harm. Then, I want to apologize for any past awkwardness and give her a gift of ten thousand roubles to help her break things off with Luzhin. I think she might want to do that if she sees a way out. \n\n“You’re out of your mind,” Raskolnikov said, shocked more than angry. “How can you even say that?”\n\n“I knew you’d react like this. But listen, even though I’m not rich, that ten thousand roubles is free for me. I don’t need it. If she doesn’t take it, I’ll just waste it on something silly. That’s the first point. Second, my conscience is clear. I’m making this offer with no hidden agenda. You might not believe me, but in the end, both you and Avdotya will see it. \n\nThe truth is, I caused her some trouble, and I regret it. I want to do something good for her, just to show that I’m not only capable of causing harm. If I had any selfish motives, I wouldn’t be so upfront about it. Plus, I offered her more five weeks ago. And just so you know, I might marry someone soon, which should clear up any doubts about my intentions toward Avdotya.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov offers Raskolnikov's sister, Avdotya, ten thousand roubles to help her break away from Mr. Luzhin, claiming it is a selfless act to make amends for past troubles."
