  "text": "Raskolnikov left the keys in the chest and dashed back to the old woman’s body. He grabbed the axe and lifted it again, but didn’t swing it. She was definitely dead. Leaning in closer, he saw her skull was cracked and caved in on one side. He almost touched it but pulled back; it was obvious without feeling. Blood was everywhere.\n\nThen he spotted a string around her neck. He yanked at it, but it was tough and soaked in blood. Trying to pull it from the front of her dress didn’t work either. Frustrated, he raised the axe again to cut the string from above but hesitated. After a couple of tense minutes, he managed to slice the string without hitting the body. It was a purse. \n\nOn the string were two crosses—one made of Cyprus wood, the other copper—plus a silver filigree image. The small, greasy chamois leather purse was stuffed to the brim. Raskolnikov shoved it into his pocket without checking it out, tossed the crosses onto the old woman, and rushed back into the bedroom, axe in hand.\n\nHe was in a mad rush, grabbed the keys, and started trying them again. But no luck. They wouldn’t fit. It wasn’t just his hands shaking; he kept messing up. Even when he saw a key didn’t fit, he still tried it.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, after killing the old woman, attempts to retrieve a purse from her body while struggling with his panic and the keys to a strong box."
