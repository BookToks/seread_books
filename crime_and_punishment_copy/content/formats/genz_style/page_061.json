I might even send you thirty roubles instead of twenty-five. \n\nBut I’ve already filled two sheets, and there’s no room left to write more. So much has happened! \n\nMy dear Rodya, I’m sending you a big hug and a mother’s blessing until we can meet. Love Dounia, your sister. She loves you more than anything—more than herself. She’s an angel, and you’re everything to us—our hope and comfort. If you’re happy, we’ll be happy too. \n\nDo you still say your prayers, Rodya? Do you believe in the mercy of our Creator? I worry that you might be influenced by the doubts that are out there now. If so, I’m praying for you. Remember when you were a kid, saying your prayers at my knee while your father was alive? Those were happy times. \n\nGoodbye for now. I’m sending you warm hugs and lots of kisses.\n\nYours till death,  \nPULCHERIA RASKOLNIKOV.  \n\nAs Raskolnikov read the letter, tears streamed down his face.
