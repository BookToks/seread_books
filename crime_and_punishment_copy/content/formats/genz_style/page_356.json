  "text": "Raskolnikov plopped down on the sofa, while Porfiry sat at the other end, waiting for him to spill the tea. The whole vibe felt heavy and awkward, especially since Raskolnikov thought what he had to say wasn’t that big of a deal. But he got to the point, explaining his situation clearly and feeling pretty good about it. He even managed to give Porfiry a good look. Porfiry, however, didn’t take his eyes off him. Razumihin, sitting across the table, was all ears, glancing back and forth between them with way too much interest.\n\n“Idiot,” Raskolnikov thought to himself.\n\nPorfiry, with a serious tone, said, “You need to inform the police about the murder. Let them know that you claim some items and want to get them back.\" \n\nRaskolnikov tried to act all flustered. “The thing is, right now, I’m kinda broke… even this small amount is a stretch. I just wanted to say those things are mine, and when I have cash…”\n\nPorfiry cut him off, his tone icy. “That’s fine. You can just write to me directly, saying you know about the situation and that you want to claim your stuff.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov discusses a matter of business with Porfiry Petrovitch, revealing his financial struggles while trying to claim ownership of certain items related to a murder."
