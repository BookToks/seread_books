It was a tiny, cramped space‚Äîabout six paces long‚Äîlooking super run-down. The dusty yellow wallpaper was peeling, and the low ceiling made it awkward for anyone taller than average, constantly reminding him he might hit his head. \n\nThe furniture matched the vibe: three old, shaky chairs and a painted table in the corner piled with a few dusty manuscripts and books‚Äîclearly untouched for ages. A big, clunky sofa took up almost an entire wall and a good chunk of the floor. It used to have a nice cover but now it was in tatters, serving as Raskolnikov's bed. He often crashed on it without even changing clothes, just wrapped in his old student coat, head resting on a tiny pillow stuffed with all his linens, clean and dirty. There was a small table in front of the sofa.\n\nIt would be hard to find a place more disordered than this, but for Raskolnikov, in his current mindset, it was oddly comforting. He felt completely isolated, like a tortoise hiding in its shell, and even the sight of his messy surroundings didn‚Äôt bother him. üê¢\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov wakes up in a disheveled, oppressive room, feeling irritable and disconnected from the world around him."
