  "text": "I was sitting there today, feeling all kinds of heavy after a terrible takeout dinner. I was smoking when, out of nowhere, Marfa Petrovna walked in. She looked sharp in a new green silk dress with a long train. “Hey, Arkady Ivanovitch! What do you think of my dress? Aniska can’t make something like this.” (Aniska was a dressmaker from the country, one of our old serf girls who learned her craft in Moscow—she was cute.) She twirled around in front of me. I checked out the dress, then gave her face a good look. “I’m surprised you bother coming to me about such small stuff, Marfa Petrovna.” \n\n“Goodness, you won’t let anything bother you!” To mess with her, I said, “I want to get married, Marfa Petrovna.” \n\n“That’s so like you, Arkady Ivanovitch. It’s not a good look to be searching for a bride when you’ve barely buried your wife. And if you could even pick someone decent, I know it wouldn’t lead to happiness for either of you. You’ll just end up a joke to everyone.” Then she left, and her train rustled as she walked away. Isn’t that ridiculous? \n\n“But maybe you’re just lying?” Raskolnikov chimed in. \n\n“I hardly ever lie,” Svidrigaïlov replied, thinking it over, clearly not bothered by the rudeness. \n\n“And in the past, have you ever seen ghosts?” \n\n“Yeah, I’ve seen them, but only once. Six years ago, I had a serf named Filka. Right after his burial, I called out without thinking, ‘Filka, my pipe!’ He came in and went straight to the cupboard where my pipes were. I just sat there, thinking, ‘He’s doing this out of revenge,’ because we had a huge fight right before he died. ‘How dare you come in like that?’”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marfa Petrovna visits Svidrigaïlov, showcasing her new dress and teasing him about seeking a bride shortly after his wife's death."
