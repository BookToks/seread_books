  "text": "“I don’t know what to wish you,” Raskolnikov said as he started down the stairs but glanced back. “I want to wish you success, but your job is just so ridiculous.”\n\n“Ridiculous? How so?” Porfiry Petrovitch turned to leave, but his interest was piqued.\n\n“Well, you must’ve been really messing with that poor Nikolay’s head, right? Torturing him until he confessed! You probably hounded him day and night, convincing him he was the murderer. And now that he’s confessed, you’ll just start picking apart his story again. ‘You’re lying!’ you’ll say. ‘You can’t be the murderer! This isn’t even your story!’ It’s honestly kind of funny!”\n\n“He-he-he! You caught that I told Nikolay it wasn’t his own story, huh?”\n\n“Of course I did!”\n\n“He-he! You’re sharp. You notice everything! You have a playful mind! They say that’s a trait of Gogol, one of the writers.”\n\n“Yeah, Gogol.”\n\n“Right, Gogol… I look forward to seeing you again.”\n\n“Same here.”\n\nRaskolnikov headed straight home. He was so confused that once he got there, he plopped down on the sofa and sat for a good fifteen minutes, trying to sort through his thoughts. He didn’t even try to think about Nikolay; he was just dazed.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reflects on the psychological manipulation involved in Nikolay's confession, finding humor in the absurdity of the situation."
