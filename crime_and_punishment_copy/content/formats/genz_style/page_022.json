In poverty, you can still keep your dignity, but in beggary—never. No one can hold their head high. When someone’s begging, they don’t just get kicked out; they’re swept away like trash. And honestly, I’m the first to humiliate myself in that situation. That’s why I’m here at this tavern!\n\nA month ago, Mr. Lebeziatnikov hit my wife, and trust me, she’s not someone you mess with! Do you get what I’m saying? Let me ask you this: have you ever spent a night on a hay barge on the Neva?”\n\n“No, I can’t say I have,” Raskolnikov replied, confused.\n\n“Well, I just did, and it’s been five nights like that for me…” He poured himself another drink, downed it, and paused. You could see bits of hay stuck to his clothes and hair. It was clear he hadn’t washed or changed in days. His hands were grimy, chubby, red, with black nails.\n\nHis story seemed to catch some lazy interest from the crowd. The boys at the counter started to giggle. The innkeeper came down from upstairs, probably just to hear this “funny fellow,” and sat nearby, yawning but trying to look dignified. Clearly, Marmeladov was a regular here.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marmeladov reflects on the distinctions between poverty, drunkenness, and beggary, emphasizing the humiliation associated with the latter."
