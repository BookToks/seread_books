  "text": "A bunch of super drunk peasants stumbled out of the tavern, decked out in bright red and blue shirts, coats flung over their shoulders. \n\n“Get in, get in!” yelled one guy, a thick-necked peasant with a face as red as a carrot. “I’ll take all of you!”\n\nThe crowd erupted in laughter. \n\n“Take us all with that old nag?”  \n“Mikolka, are you out of your mind putting that horse in a cart?”  \n“That mare’s gotta be at least twenty years old!”  \n\nMikolka jumped into the cart, grabbed the reins, and stood tall. “The good horse went with Matvey,” he shouted. “This poor thing is breaking my heart; I could just kill her! She’s eating like there’s no tomorrow. Get in! I’ll make her gallop! She’ll gallop!” He picked up a whip, clearly excited to give the little mare a good smack.\n\n“Get in! Come on!” The crowd just laughed. “You hear that? She’ll gallop!”  \n“Gallop? She hasn’t galloped in a decade!”  \n“She’ll just jog along!”  \n“Don’t worry, everyone! Bring a whip and get ready!”  \n“Alright! Let’s give it to her!”  \n\nThey all piled into Mikolka’s cart, still laughing.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A group of drunken peasants humorously mocks a young man named Mikolka as he insists his old mare can still gallop while preparing to whip her."
