Panic hit him hard. \n\n“What made me think she wouldn’t be home?” he wondered as he walked through the gateway. “Why did I assume that so confidently?” \n\nHe felt crushed and humiliated. Part of him wanted to laugh at his own anger. A dull rage bubbled inside him. \n\nHe hesitated in the gateway. Going out to look normal seemed gross; heading back to his room felt even worse. “What a chance I’ve lost forever!” he muttered, standing aimlessly near the porter’s dark little room, which was also open. \n\nThen something shiny caught his eye under the bench just a couple of steps away. He glanced around—no one was watching. He tiptoed into the room, took two steps down, and softly called out to the porter. “Yeah, not home! But someone’s nearby; the door’s wide open.” \n\nHe rushed to the axe (yes, it was an axe) and pulled it out from under the bench, wedged between two chunks of wood. Before heading out, he secured it in a noose, shoved his hands into his pockets, and left the room. No one had seen him! “When reason fails, the devil helps!” he thought, grinning strangely. This lucky break lifted his spirits a ton. \n\nHe walked calmly and steadily, no rush.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist experiences a mix of anxiety and exhilaration upon finding an axe that he believes will aid in executing his plan."
