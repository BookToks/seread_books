Such fancy words—so scientific, so comforting. Once you throw out “percentage,” you stop worrying. If we had a different term… maybe we’d feel more uneasy. But what if Dounia is part of that percentage? Or another one, if not this one?\n\n“Where am I headed?” he suddenly thought. “Weird, I came out for something. After reading the letter, I stepped out… I was going to Vassilyevsky Ostrov, to Razumihin. That’s it… now I remember. But why did I think of Razumihin just now? That’s odd.”\n\nHe was surprised by himself. Razumihin was one of his old buddies from university.
