Seriously! \n\n‘But why did you even come? Your laughter when you walked in—remember that? I saw it so clearly, but if I hadn't been expecting you, I wouldn’t have noticed your laugh at all. Crazy how moods work, right? Mr. Razumihin—ah, that stone where all the hidden stuff was! I can picture it in a garden. You told Zametov about it, and then you brought it up in my office, right? When we started dissecting your article, you explained it in a way that could mean two things, like there was a secret meaning lurking there.\n\n‘So, Rodion Romanovitch, I hit a wall and had to snap myself out of it. I thought, “Wait, you can look at this differently, and honestly, it makes more sense that way.” It was frustrating! I decided I needed some solid proof, so when I heard about the bell-ringing, I held my breath, all nervous. “Here’s my solid proof,” I thought, and I didn’t overthink it—I just wouldn’t. I would’ve paid a fortune to see you in that moment when you walked next to that worker after he called you a murderer to your face, and you didn’t even ask him anything the whole time. And then there was your shaking… what was up with that?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The narrative explores the complexities of human psychology and perception, emphasizing how mood and expectation can influence one's interpretation of events."
