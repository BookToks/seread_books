He’s got a heavy thought stuck in his head. \n\n“I’m really worried about him,” one person said. “It’s gotta be something serious!”\n\n“Maybe it’s that guy, Pyotr Petrovitch. I think he’s planning to marry his sister. He got a letter about it right before he got sick…”\n\n“Yeah, that guy could totally mess things up. But have you noticed? He doesn’t care about anything—except for one thing: the murder.” 😳\n\n“Right! I saw that too. He’s scared and interested at the same time. That day at the police station? He fainted.” \n\n“Tell me more later; he’s really intriguing! I’m heading over to see him again in half an hour… but I doubt there’ll be any inflammation.” \n\n“Thanks! I’ll hang out with Pashenka and keep an eye on him through Nastasya.” \n\nRaskolnikov was alone now, feeling anxious and frustrated as he watched Nastasya linger. \n\n“Want some tea?” she asked. \n\n“Later! I’m tired. Just go.” \n\nHe turned away from her, and Nastasya left.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's mental state is a source of concern for those around him, particularly regarding his fixation on a recent murder."
