The main issue was settled in his mind: “No way I’m letting you marry Mr. Luzhin. Not on my watch!” He smirked, feeling the victory of his decision. “No, Mom, no, Dounia, you can’t fool me! And then they have the nerve to say they didn’t ask for my opinion and just decided without me? Seriously? They think it’s all set in stone, but we’ll see about that! What a lame excuse: ‘Pyotr Petrovitch is so busy that even his wedding has to be rushed.’ \n\nNo, Dounia, I get it. I know what you wanted to say to me. I know what you were thinking about while pacing all night and what your prayers were like before the Holy Mother of Kazan in Mom’s bedroom. The climb to Golgotha is tough… So, it’s settled; you’ve chosen to marry this “sensible businessman,” Avdotya Romanovna, who’s already made his fortune (way more impressive), holds two government jobs, and shares the ideas of our “most rising generation,” as Mom puts it.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is resolute in rejecting his mother's wishes for his sister Dounia to marry Mr. Luzhin."
