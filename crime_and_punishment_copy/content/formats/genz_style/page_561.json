  "text": "I get it—your views clash with mine, and I’m not a fan of private charity that doesn’t really fix anything. But honestly, I figured you were embarrassed to drop a big donation in front of me. Maybe you wanted to surprise her with that whole hundred-rouble note in her pocket. (Some people love to make their good deeds look fancy.) \n\nThen I thought, maybe you were testing her. Would she come to thank you when she found it? Or maybe you just didn’t want any thanks at all, like the saying goes, “don’t let your right hand know…” You know the vibe. I had so many theories swirling in my head that I didn’t want to show you I was onto your little secret. \n\nBut then I worried that Sofya Semyonovna might lose the money before she even noticed it. That’s why I decided to pop in and tell her you slipped a hundred roubles into her pocket. On my way, I stopped by Madame Kobilatnikov’s to drop off the ‘General Treatise on the Positive Method’ and recommend Piderit’s article (plus Wagner’s). Then I came here, and wow, what a mess! \n\nNow, could I really have all these thoughts and ideas if I hadn’t seen you put that hundred-rouble note in her pocket? \n\nWhen Lebeziatnikov wrapped up his long speech with that conclusion, he was wiped out, sweat pouring down his face. He still couldn’t even speak Russian properly, though.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The speaker reflects on the complexities of charitable actions and the motivations behind them, questioning the sincerity of private benevolence."
