  "text": "What do you think? Seriously, put down your cap. You look like you’re about to leave, and that makes me uneasy. I’m really glad you’re here. \n\nRaskolnikov set his cap aside and listened, his face serious and frowning, to Porfiry Petrovitch’s vague and pointless chatter. ‘Is he really trying to distract me with this nonsense?’ \n\n“I can’t offer you coffee, but how about spending five minutes with a friend?” Porfiry rambled on. “You know how these official duties are… Sorry for pacing around. I hope it doesn’t annoy you. I just need to move; sitting all day drives me nuts. I keep saying I’ll join a gym. They say even big shots like Privy Councillors are there, skipping around. That’s modern science for you! \n\nBut about my job here—these inquiries and all that… You mentioned inquiries, right? Sometimes, it’s more awkward for the person asking than the one being asked. You made a great point earlier, even if you didn’t realize it. It gets confusing! Like a broken record! They say there’s going to be a reform, and we’ll even have a new name. Ha! And about our legal tradition, as you called it, I totally agree. Every prisoner, even the roughest peasant, knows they start by disarming him.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov listens to Porfiry's aimless chatter, questioning whether it is a distraction from his own thoughts."
