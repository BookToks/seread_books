  "text": "She doesn’t look like a pro, right? More like someone who got drunk and was tricked into this situation for the first time. You get what I mean? They’ve tossed her out onto the street like this. Just look at her torn dress and how it’s been thrown on her—she didn’t do that herself. Someone else dressed her, and not very well, probably a guy. You can tell. \n\nNow, check this out: I don’t know that guy I almost fought earlier, but he’s definitely seen her too. He spotted her on the road, drunk and lost, and now he’s eager to grab her while she’s like this. Trust me, I’m not mistaken. I saw him watching her and following her. I stepped in, but he’s just waiting for me to leave. He’s moved away a bit now, pretending to roll a cigarette. \n\nWe need to figure out how to keep her safe from him and get her home. \n\nThe cop noticed everything in a flash. The fat guy was easy to read, but he turned his attention to the girl. He leaned in to get a better look, his face full of real concern. \n\n“Ah, what a shame!” he said, shaking his head. “She’s just a kid! You can tell she’s been fooled.” He turned to her, “Hey, where do you live?” The girl blinked, looking tired and confused, and waved her hand. \n\n“Here,” Raskolnikov said, digging into his pocket and pulling out twenty copecks. “Call a cab and tell him to take her home.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov observes a vulnerable girl who has been deceived and is in danger, prompting him to intervene and protect her."
