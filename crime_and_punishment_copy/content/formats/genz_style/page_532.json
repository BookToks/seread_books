  "text": "Katerina Ivanovna might have been worn down by life, but her spirit was unbreakable. No one could intimidate her, and her will was strong. Sonia was right; Katerina’s mind was a bit off. She wasn’t insane, but the stress she’d faced for a year had definitely taken its toll. Doctors say that late-stage consumption can mess with your brain. \n\nThe dinner spread wasn’t fancy. No Madeira wine, just some cheap vodka, rum, and Lisbon wine—plenty of it, though. Along with the usual rice and honey, there were a few dishes, including pancakes, all whipped up in Amalia Ivanovna’s kitchen. Two samovars were boiling away for tea and punch after the meal. \n\nKaterina Ivanovna had taken charge of shopping, with help from a little Polish guy who was stuck at Madame Lippevechsel’s. He was eager to please, running around all day, making sure everyone knew he was helping. He’d dash to Katerina for every little thing, even tracking her down at the market, calling her “Pani” the whole time. By the end, she was pretty fed up with him, even though she’d initially claimed she couldn’t manage without this “helpful and generous man.” Katerina had a habit of seeing everyone in the best light, often exaggerating their good traits.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna, despite her mental strain and difficult circumstances, organizes a dinner to honor the memory of her deceased husband, showcasing her determination and social aspirations."
