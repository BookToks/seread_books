  "text": "Dounia told me that even though he’s not super educated, he’s smart and seems nice. You know your sister, Rodya. She’s strong, sensible, patient, and generous, but she’s got a passionate side too. There’s not a ton of love between them yet, but Dounia is a smart girl with a heart of gold. She’ll do her best to make her husband happy, and he’ll want to make her happy too. We can trust that.\n\nSure, everything’s moving fast, but he’s a careful guy. He knows that if Dounia is happy, he’ll be happier too. As for any flaws or differences in opinions—totally normal in marriages—Dounia believes she can handle it. She’s ready to deal with a lot, as long as their relationship is honest and respectful.\n\nAt first, he seemed a bit blunt, but that might just be his straightforward nature. After Dounia said yes, he mentioned that he planned to marry a girl with a good reputation, who’s been through tough times and doesn’t come with a dowry. He thinks it’s better for a wife to see her husband as someone she can rely on, rather than being indebted to him.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia is a sensible and generous woman who is prepared to make her marriage work despite the lack of deep love and the haste of the arrangement."
