She seemed distracted, though she kept glancing at Katerina Ivanovna, trying to make her happy. Neither of them could find mourning clothes; Sonia wore dark colors instead.\n\n“Look at him, what an idiot! Why was he even brought here?” Katerina Ivanovna said, her face serious as she turned sharply to Amalia Ivanovna, who looked taken aback. “Not like your fancy friends who my dad wouldn’t even hire as cooks. My late husband would have welcomed them out of kindness.”\n\n“Yes, he liked to drink. He really did!” the clerk said, downing his twelfth shot of vodka.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna jumped in, “Sure, my late husband had that flaw, and everyone knows it. But he was a good man who loved and respected his family. The problem was, his kindness made him trust shady people. He’d drink with guys who weren’t even worth his time. You wouldn’t believe it, Rodion Romanovitch, but they found a gingerbread cock in his pocket! He was wasted, but he still thought of the kids!”\n\n“A cock? Did you say a cock?” the clerk shouted.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna didn’t answer. She sighed, lost in her thoughts.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna defends her late husband’s character, emphasizing his kindness and love for his family despite his drinking problem."
