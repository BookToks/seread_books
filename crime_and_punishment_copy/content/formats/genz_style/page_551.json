  "text": "“I don’t know… I really don’t know anything about it,” Sonia said quietly at last. \n\n“No? You don’t know anything?” Luzhin repeated, pausing for a few seconds. “Think about it, mademoiselle,” he said sternly but almost like a teacher. “Take your time to consider. Here’s the thing: if I wasn’t completely sure, I wouldn’t accuse you so directly. You can believe that. If I’m wrong, I could be held responsible for saying this in front of witnesses. \n\nThis morning, I changed some five-percent securities for about three thousand roubles (that’s a lot of money). I wrote it all down in my pocketbook. When I got home, I counted the cash—Mr. Lebeziatnikov can back me up on this. I counted two thousand three hundred roubles and put the rest in my pocketbook in my coat. There was about five hundred roubles left on the table, including three notes of a hundred roubles each. \n\nThat’s when you walked in (I invited you, remember)—and you looked super nervous. You even tried to leave three times during our conversation. Mr. Lebeziatnikov saw that too. You’ll probably agree that I invited you through him just to talk about your relative, Katerina Ivanovna (the one whose dinner I couldn’t make), and whether we should help her out.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Luzhin accuses Sonia of theft, asserting that her embarrassment during their conversation indicates guilt."
