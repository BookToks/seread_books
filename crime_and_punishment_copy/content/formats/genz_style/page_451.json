Katerina Ivanovna says she can’t take it anymore.” \n\n“Why is she so confident? Does she count on you?” \n\n“Don’t say that… We’re a team, we’re in this together.” Sonia was upset, almost angry, like a little bird defending itself. “What can she do? What can she do?” She was getting worked up. “She cried so much today! Can’t you see she’s losing it? One minute she’s worried about everything being perfect for tomorrow, the lunch and all that. Then she’s in agony, bleeding and weeping, and suddenly she’s banging her head against the wall in despair. But then she calms down. She’s counting on you; she thinks you’ll help her. She believes she’ll borrow some cash and go back to her hometown.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia expresses deep concern for Katerina Ivanovna's unstable state and reliance on others for support amidst their struggles."
