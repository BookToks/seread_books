  "text": "Raskolnikov was on his way up to the police office when he heard a dog barking loudly. A woman yelled at it and even threw a rolling pin. He stepped outside into the yard and saw Sonia, looking pale and terrified. Her face showed deep pain and despair. She clasped her hands together. He stood there, forcing a strange, meaningless smile, then turned and walked back to the police office.\n\nIlya Petrovitch was sitting at a table, going through some papers. The same peasant from earlier was there too.\n\n“Hey! You back already? Forget something? What’s up?” Ilya asked.\n\nRaskolnikov, with pale lips and wide eyes, moved closer. He reached the table, leaned on it, and tried to speak, but only made incoherent sounds.\n\n“You look sick. Here, sit down! Want some water?” Ilya offered.\n\nRaskolnikov plopped down in a chair, still staring at Ilya, who looked surprised. They both waited for a moment. Someone brought water.\n\n“I need to tell you…” Raskolnikov started.\n\n“Drink some water,” Ilya urged.\n\nRaskolnikov waved the water away and, in a shaky but clear voice, said, “I killed the old pawnbroker and her sister Lizaveta with an axe and robbed them.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confesses to killing the old pawnbroker and her sister."
