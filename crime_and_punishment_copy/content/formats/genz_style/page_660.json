So now, when I meet someone smart like you—super interesting—I’m just happy to chat. Plus, I had a half-glass of champagne, and it’s gone to my head a bit. \n\nThere’s something that’s really got me fired up, but I’ll keep that to myself for now. Where are you headed?” he asked, suddenly concerned.\n\nRaskolnikov started to stand up. He felt trapped and uncomfortable being there. He was sure Svidrigaïlov was the biggest scoundrel around.\n\n“Ah! Sit down, just stay a bit!” Svidrigaïlov pleaded. “Let’s get you some tea. I promise I won’t just ramble on about myself. I’ll share something interesting. Want to hear how a woman tried to ‘save’ me? It ties back to your first question, actually, because that woman was your sister. Can I tell you? It’ll help pass the time.”\n\n“Go ahead, but I hope you...” \n\n“Don’t worry. Even a lowlife like me has nothing but respect for Avdotya Romanovna.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov expresses his willingness to share a story about Raskolnikov's sister, Avdotya Romanovna, while acknowledging his own flaws."
