  "text": "“Here he is, lying on the sofa! What do you want?” \n\nThat casual “what do you want” seemed to throw the pompous guy off balance. He started to turn to Razumihin but caught himself and faced Zossimov instead.\n\n“This is Raskolnikov,” Zossimov mumbled, nodding toward him. Then he yawned big, like he was trying to stretch his mouth to the max. He lazily pulled out a big gold watch, checked the time, and slowly tucked it back away.\n\nRaskolnikov lay there, quiet, staring at the stranger. His face was pale and looked like he’d just been through something brutal, like a painful surgery. But as the newcomer spoke, Raskolnikov's curiosity turned to suspicion and even a bit of alarm. When Zossimov said, “This is Raskolnikov,” he shot up, sat on the sofa, and said, almost defiantly but weakly, “Yes, I am Raskolnikov! What do you want?”\n\nThe visitor looked him over and said dramatically, “Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin. I believe I have reason to hope that my name is not wholly unknown to you?” \n\nBut Raskolnikov, expecting something different, just stared blankly at him, lost in thought.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, lying on the sofa, is confronted by the pompous Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, who introduces himself but receives a confused and unresponsive reaction."
