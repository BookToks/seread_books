  "text": "Katerina Ivanovna was fuming. “That table could only have been set by Amalia Ivanovna!” She also couldn't stand the new ribbons on her cap. Seriously, did this stuck-up German think she was hot stuff just because she ran the house and was doing the lodgers a “favor”? As if! Katerina Ivanovna’s dad had been a colonel and even a governor. Back in the day, they’d set the table for forty people, and no way would someone like Amalia Ivanovna (or should we say Ludwigovna?) have been allowed in the kitchen.\n\nBut Katerina decided to keep her feelings to herself for now. She treated Amalia coldly but was planning to put that woman in her place soon. Who did she think she was? \n\nWhat really got under Katerina's skin was that barely any of the lodgers showed up for the funeral. The only one who made it was the Pole who just happened to stumble into the cemetery. But for the memorial dinner? The poorest and most insignificant ones came, many of them barely sober. The decent ones all stayed away, like Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin. He was supposed to be the most respectable of the bunch but didn’t even show up. Katerina had hyped him up to everyone—Amalia, Polenka, Sonia, and the Pole—saying he was generous, noble, and had connections. He even claimed to be a friend of her late husband and had promised to help her out.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna feels disillusioned and irritated by the lack of respect shown by the lodgers and the behavior of Amalia Ivanovna during a memorial dinner."
