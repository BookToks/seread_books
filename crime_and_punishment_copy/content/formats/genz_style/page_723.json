  "text": "Raskolnikov felt a wave of horror and deep sadness wash over him. He could tell from her eyes that she knew something was up. \n\n“Should I come in or leave?” he asked, unsure. \n\n“I spent all day with Sofya Semyonovna. We were both waiting for you. We thought you’d definitely show up,” she replied.\n\nHe stepped into the room and collapsed into a chair, completely worn out. \n\n“I feel weak, Dounia. I’m really tired. I wish I could just keep it together right now.” He looked at her with suspicion. \n\n“Where were you all night?” \n\n“I can’t really remember. I wanted to make a decision once and for all. I walked by the Neva a few times, thinking about ending it all there, but… I just couldn’t go through with it,” he said softly, glancing at her again with doubt.\n\n“Thank God! That’s what we feared, Sofya and I. So you still have hope? Thank God, thank God!” \n\nRaskolnikov gave a bitter smile. \n\n“I don’t have hope, but I just cried in Mother’s arms. I don’t have hope, but I asked her to pray for me. I don’t get it, Dounia. I really don’t.” \n\n“Did you see Mother? Did you tell her?” Dounia gasped, horrified. “You didn’t, right?” \n\n“No, I didn’t say it outright, but she picked up on a lot. She heard you talking in your sleep. I’m sure she understands more than I think. Maybe I shouldn’t have gone…”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses his exhaustion and inner turmoil to his sister Dounia, revealing his struggle with despair and the contemplation of ending his life."
