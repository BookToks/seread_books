  "text": "He rushed to Svidrigaïlov’s place, unsure of what he hoped to find. But there was something about that guy that pulled him in. Once he realized it, he couldn’t shake it off. Now, he felt the moment had come.\n\nOn the way, one thought nagged at him: had Svidrigaïlov talked to Porfiry? He was pretty sure he hadn’t. He replayed Porfiry’s visit in his mind—no way he had. \n\nBut what if Svidrigaïlov had some hidden agenda with Dounia? (His sister.) That idea haunted him, even in his dreams. It made him furious. This could change everything.\n\nWhy waste time on someone like Svidrigaïlov? Ugh, he was sick of it all! Yet here he was, racing to see him. Was he hoping for new info or a way out? Desperate people cling to anything. Was this fate or just his tired mind? Maybe he needed someone else, like Sonia. But what would he ask her for? More tears? He was scared of her, too. She felt like a final verdict—he had to choose his path or hers. Right now, he didn’t feel ready to face her.\n\nSo, was Svidrigaïlov the better option? Deep down, he knew he needed to see him for some reason. But what could they even talk about? Their wrongdoings were totally different. Plus, Svidrigaïlov was sketchy—creepy, manipulative, and maybe even malicious. Sure, he helped Katerina Ivanovna’s kids, but who knew why? He always had some scheme brewing.\n\nAnother thought kept creeping into Raskolnikov’s mind, making him anxious. It was painful enough that he tried to push it away. Sometimes, he felt like Svidrigaïlov was stalking him. It was unsettling.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is conflicted about seeking out Svidrigaïlov, feeling both drawn to and repulsed by him amid his despair."
