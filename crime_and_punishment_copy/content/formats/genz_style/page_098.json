  "text": "The student kept talking, saying that Lizaveta, the old woman's sister, was always getting beaten and treated like a kid, even though she was super tall—like six feet! “What a situation!” the student laughed. \n\nThey started chatting about Lizaveta. The student clearly enjoyed it, laughing as he spoke, while the officer listened intently and asked him to send Lizaveta over for some sewing repairs. Raskolnikov soaked it all in and learned everything he could about her. \n\nLizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her half-sister (different mom). She was thirty-five and worked nonstop for her sister. Besides cooking and cleaning, she sewed and did odd jobs, giving her sister all her earnings. She was too scared to take any job without her sister’s okay. \n\nThe old woman had already made a will, and Lizaveta knew she wouldn’t get anything from it—just some furniture. All the money was going to a monastery in the province of N—— for prayers to be said for her forever. Lizaveta was seen as lower status than her sister, single, and not exactly graceful. She was super tall with long feet that looked a bit awkward. She wore old goatskin shoes but kept herself clean. What really surprised the student was that Lizaveta was always pregnant. 🤰\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Lizaveta, the half-sister of the old woman, is trapped in a life of servitude and dependency, working tirelessly for her sister while receiving no inheritance."
