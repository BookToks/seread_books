The idea that it was planned out doesn’t add up. If he was inexperienced, luck is what saved him. He probably didn’t see the obstacles coming! How did he even pull it off? He grabbed some jewels worth ten or twenty roubles, stuffed his pockets, rummaged through the old lady’s stuff—and they found fifteen hundred roubles in cash and notes!” 💰\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** the old pawnbroker's possession, indicating the murder was likely committed by an inexperienced individual rather than a cunning criminal."
