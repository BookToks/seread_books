  "text": "Sonia helped prisoners by writing letters and sending them gifts from their families. Their loved ones would come to see her, bringing money and presents. When she visited Raskolnikov or crossed paths with the prisoners, they all tipped their hats to her. “Little mother Sofya Semyonovna, you’re our sweet little mom,” the rough criminals would say to her. She’d smile and bow, and everyone loved it when she did. They even admired how she walked and couldn’t decide what they liked most about her. They came to her for help when they were sick, too.\n\nRaskolnikov was in the hospital from mid-Lent until after Easter. Once he got better, he recalled the wild dreams he had while he was feverish. He dreamt that the whole world was hit by a terrible new plague from Asia. Only a few chosen people would survive. This plague was caused by smart microbes that made people go mad and furious. But those infected thought they were the smartest and had all the answers. They believed their ideas and morals were flawless. Entire villages and towns went crazy from the infection. Everyone was hyped up and confused.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia is a compassionate figure admired by prisoners, while Raskolnikov reflects on a feverish dream of a plague that drives humanity to madness and delusion."
