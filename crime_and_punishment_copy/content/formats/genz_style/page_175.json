I’m here for business,’ the guy replied.\n\n‘Cool, take a seat.’ Razumihin plopped down across from him. ‘Glad you’re back with us, man,’ he said to Raskolnikov. ‘You’ve barely eaten or drunk anything for four days. We had to give you tea in tiny sips. I even brought Zossimov to check on you twice. Remember him? He said it’s nothing serious—just some nerves from not eating. He thinks you need more beer and radish to feel better. It’ll pass. Zossimov’s a solid guy! He’s making a name for himself. Anyway, I won’t hold you up,’ he said, turning to the messenger. ‘What’s up? You know, this is the second time they’ve sent someone from the office. Last time, it was a different guy I spoke to. Who was it again?’\n\n‘That was two days ago, if I remember correctly. That was Alexey Semyonovitch; he works in our office too.’\n\n‘He seemed smarter than you, right?’\n\n‘Yeah, definitely. He’s got more authority than I do.’\n\n‘Exactly. So, what’s the deal?’ \n\n‘At your mom’s request, through Afanasy Ivanovitch Vahrushin—who you’ve probably heard of—a remittance is being sent to you from our office.’”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is visited by a messenger from a merchant with news of a remittance sent to him at his mother's request."
