  "text": "“Are you really saying you have proof of this?” Dounia asked, serious and firm.\n\n“I’m just repeating what Marfa Petrovna told me in private. Legally, the situation was pretty murky. There’s a woman named Resslich around here. She’s a foreigner who lends money and does other shady stuff. Svidrigaïlov had a long, weird relationship with her. She had a niece, a girl about fifteen, who was deaf and mute. Resslich despised her and treated her horribly, even beating her. One day, they found the girl hanging in the attic. The inquest ruled it a suicide. After the usual procedures, that was it. But later, rumors spread that Svidrigaïlov had... done terrible things to her. \n\nNow, this wasn’t confirmed. The info came from another unreliable German woman, so it never went to the police. Thanks to Marfa Petrovna’s money and influence, it stayed as just gossip. Still, it’s a pretty significant story. You probably heard about the servant Philip when you were with them, right? He died from mistreatment six years ago, before serfdom was abolished.”\n\n“I heard he hanged himself,” Dounia replied.\n\n“Right, but what pushed him to that?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia confronts the unclear circumstances surrounding Svidrigaïlov's alleged involvement in a girl's suicide and the mistreatment of a servant named Philip."
