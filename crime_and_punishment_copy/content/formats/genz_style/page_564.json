  "text": "Sofya Semyonovna sat next to my sister, but I told him I’d already done that earlier. He got mad that my mom and sister wouldn’t fight back against his jabs, so he got really rude to them. Eventually, he got kicked out of the house. This all went down yesterday evening. \n\nNow, listen closely: if he had managed to prove that Sofya was a thief, it would’ve made my mom and sister think he was right about his suspicions. He’d seem justified in being upset that I compared my sister to Sofya. By attacking me, he could pretend he was protecting my sister’s honor, his fiancée. \n\nHe might’ve even used this to drive a wedge between me and my family, hoping to win back their favor. Plus, he probably wanted revenge on me, knowing how much I care about Sofya’s honor and happiness. That’s what he was after! I’m sure of it. That’s the whole deal, and there’s no other explanation! \n\nRaskolnikov wrapped up his speech, which everyone listened to closely, even though they interrupted him a lot. But he kept it clear and strong. His confident voice and serious expression really hit home for everyone. \n\n“Yeah, that’s it!” Lebeziatnikov chimed in excitedly. “He asked me right away if you were here when Sofya came into our room!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov argues that Luzhin's motives are driven by spite and a desire to protect his own interests at the expense of others."
