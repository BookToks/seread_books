How am I supposed to bury him? What will I feed everyone tomorrow?” \n\nRaskolnikov approached her. “Katerina Ivanovna,” he said, “last week, your husband shared his life story with me. He talked about you with so much love and respect. After hearing how devoted he was to you and your family, we became friends. I want to help you now… to honor my friend. Here’s twenty roubles. If it helps, great. I’ll come back, I promise. Maybe tomorrow… goodbye!” \n\nHe hurried out, pushing through the crowd toward the stairs. But he bumped into Nikodim Fomitch, who had come to check on things after hearing about the incident. They hadn’t seen each other since their last encounter at the police station, but Nikodim recognized him right away. \n\n“Oh, it’s you,” he said.\n\n“He’s dead,” Raskolnikov replied. “The doctor and the priest have been here, everything’s taken care of. Don’t stress her too much; she’s already sick. Try to lift her spirits if you can… you’re a good guy.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov offers financial assistance to Katerina Ivanovna after her husband's death, expressing his respect for the deceased."
