  "text": "Raskolnikov noticed the book every time he paced the room. He finally picked it up. It was the New Testament in Russian, all worn and leather-bound.\n\n“Where’d you get this?” he called to Sonia from across the room.\n\nShe stood still, just a few steps from the table. \n\n“It was brought to me,” she replied, almost reluctantly, not meeting his gaze.\n\n“Who brought it?”\n\n“Lizaveta. I asked her for it.”\n\n“Lizaveta? That’s odd,” he thought. Everything about Sonia felt stranger and more fascinating by the minute. He carried the book to the candle and started flipping through the pages.\n\n“Where’s the story of Lazarus?” he asked suddenly.\n\nSonia stared at the ground, refusing to answer. She was standing sideways to the table.\n\n“Where’s the raising of Lazarus? Find it for me, Sonia.”\n\nShe glanced at him quickly. \n\n“You’re not looking in the right spot… It’s in the fourth gospel,” she whispered firmly, still avoiding his eyes.\n\n“Find it and read it to me,” he said. He sat down, resting his elbow on the table, leaning his head on his hand, and looked away, sulking, ready to listen.\n\n“In three weeks, they’ll welcome me in the madhouse! I’ll be there if I’m not in a worse place,” he muttered to himself.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov questions Sonia about her faith and the New Testament, revealing his growing curiosity and confusion about her beliefs."
