You coming with me?” \n\n“I’m heading to your place, but not for you. I want to see Sofya Semyonovna and tell her I'm sorry I missed the funeral,” Svidrigaïlov replied.\n\n“Suit yourself, but Sofya isn’t home. She took the three kids to visit an old lady who runs some orphanages. I used to know her ages ago. I impressed her by giving some money for the kids and told her all about Sofya’s situation. It really moved her. That’s why Sofya’s at the X. Hotel where the lady is staying.”\n\n“Doesn’t matter. I’m still going,” Svidrigaïlov insisted.\n\n“Fine by me, but I’m not going with you. We’re home now. And by the way, I know you think I’m suspicious because I’ve been polite and haven’t asked you anything. It’s weird to you, right? Well, guess that’s what being polite gets you!” \n\n“And eavesdropping!” Raskolnikov shot back.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confronts Svidrigaïlov about his intentions towards his sister, revealing his suspicions and protective instincts."
