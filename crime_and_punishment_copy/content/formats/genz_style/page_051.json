  "text": "You know Dounia, right? She's super smart and has a strong will. ðŸ’ª She can handle a lot, even tough situations, and stays strong. She didnâ€™t even tell me everything because she didnâ€™t want to stress me out, even though we were always in touch.\n\nThen, things took a wild turn. Marfa Petrovna accidentally overheard her husband begging Dounia in the garden. Instead of understanding, she blamed Dounia, thinking she was the problem. A huge fight broke out right there. Marfa even hit Dounia and wouldnâ€™t listen to her side. She ordered Dounia to leave immediately, tossing all her stuffâ€”clothes and linensâ€”into a peasant cart without folding anything. \n\nTo make it worse, it started pouring rain. Dounia had to ride into town in that open cart, feeling humiliated. Just think about what I could have said in my last letter to you two months ago. I was crushed. I couldnâ€™t tell you the truth because I knew it would upset you, and what could you do anyway? Youâ€™d just worry and possibly make things worse. Dounia wouldnâ€™t let that happen either. I couldnâ€™t fill my letter with small talk when my heart was heavy. For a whole month, the town buzzed with gossip about this mess, and it got pretty bad.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia faced severe humiliation and hardship due to misunderstandings and slander, culminating in her being sent away in disgrace."
