  "text": "Katerina Ivanovna quietly put thirty roubles on the table. She didn’t say a word or even look up. Instead, she grabbed our big green shawl, draped it over her head, and lay down on the bed facing the wall. Her little shoulders shook. I just lay there, not moving.\n\nThen I saw Katerina Ivanovna go to Sonia’s tiny bed. In silence, she knelt down and kissed Sonia’s feet all evening, refusing to get up. Eventually, they both fell asleep in each other’s arms. Together. And me? I just lay there, drunk.\n\nMarmeladov paused, like his voice was gone. He quickly filled his glass, took a drink, and cleared his throat.\n\n“Since then,” he continued after a moment, “something unfortunate happened. Thanks to some nasty people, especially Darya Frantsovna, who claimed she was disrespected, my daughter Sofya Semyonovna had to take a yellow ticket (a sign of being a sex worker). Because of that, she couldn’t live with us anymore. Our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna, wouldn’t allow it, even though she had supported Darya before. Mr. Lebeziatnikov was involved too. All the drama between him and Katerina Ivanovna was about Sonia. At first, he wanted to get close to her, but then he suddenly decided he was too good for that. He said, ‘How can a highly educated man like me live in the same rooms…’”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna and Sonia share a moment of intimacy and despair as they cope with their dire circumstances."
