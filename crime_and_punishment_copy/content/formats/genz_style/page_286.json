He already helped Rodya, and if the doctor stays the night, that’s perfect!”\n\n“You see, you understand me because you’re an angel!” Razumihin said, practically glowing. “Let’s go! Nastasya! Hurry upstairs and keep him company with a light; I’ll be there in fifteen!”\n\nPulcheria Alexandrovna wasn’t totally convinced, but she didn’t argue anymore. Razumihin linked arms with both women and led them down the stairs. He made her nervous. Was he really capable of keeping his word? He seemed... off.\n\n“Ah, I see you think I’m in bad shape!” Razumihin interrupted her thoughts, striding down the pavement with such big steps that the ladies struggled to keep up. He didn’t even notice. “Nonsense! I’m drunk, sure, but not from wine. It’s just seeing you two that’s got me all mixed up... But don’t mind me! I’m rambling; I’m not worthy of you. The second I get you home, I’ll splash some water on my head right here and be fine. If only you knew how much I care about you both! Don’t laugh or get mad! You can be mad at anyone else, but not at me! I’m his friend.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin expresses his deep affection and concern for Avdotya and her mother while assuring them of his commitment to help Rodya."
