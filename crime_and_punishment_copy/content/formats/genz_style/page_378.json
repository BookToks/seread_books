  "text": "Raskolnikov didn’t say anything but stared hard at Porfiry. Razumihin looked upset, like he noticed something off. The air was tense. Raskolnikov decided to leave.\n\n“Are you heading out already?” Porfiry asked, way too friendly, reaching out to shake hands. “Really glad to meet you. About your request, don’t worry. Just write what I told you, or…”\n\n“Then you need to be more careful,” Razumihin chimed in, sounding grim.\n\nThey exchanged a few more words in the hallway. Porfiry was polite as he showed them to the door. Once outside, they walked in silence, both feeling pretty down. Raskolnikov took a deep breath.\n\n“Hey, when you went upstairs between seven and eight, did you happen to see any painters in that open flat on the second floor?” Porfiry asked. “It’s super important for us.”\n\n“Painters? No, I didn’t see any,” Raskolnikov replied slowly, trying to dig through his memory while also feeling anxious about what trap he might be stepping into. “I don’t remember seeing that flat open... But on the fourth floor, I do recall someone moving out of the flat across from Alyona Ivanovna’s. Some porters were carrying a sofa and bumped me against the wall. But painters? Nope, I didn’t see any, and I don’t think there was an open flat.”\n\n“What do you mean?” Razumihin suddenly shouted, as if it clicked for him. “Wait, the painters were working on the day of the murder, and he was there three days before! What are you asking?”\n\n“Ugh! I messed that up!” Porfiry slapped his forehead. “This whole thing is driving me nuts!” He looked at Raskolnikov, sounding a bit sorry. “It would really help us to know if anyone saw those painters between seven and eight in that flat.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov anxiously navigates a conversation with Porfiry about the details surrounding a murder, trying to avoid revealing his knowledge of the crime."
