  "text": "Dounia and I couldnâ€™t even go to church because of the nasty looks and whispers we got. Everyone we knew started avoiding us; nobody even said hi on the street. I heard some shopkeepers and clerks were planning to insult us by smearing pitch on our gates. Our landlord even told us we might have to move out. All this drama was started by Marfa Petrovna, who spread lies about Dounia and made sure to trash her name everywhere. She knows everyone around here and was in town constantly, gossiping about her own family and complaining about her husbandâ€”definitely not cool. In no time, her story reached not just the town but the whole area. It made me sick, but Dounia handled it way better than I did. You shouldâ€™ve seen her trying to keep my spirits up! Sheâ€™s truly an angel! ðŸ˜‡ \n\nBut thankfully, things turned around. Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov came to his senses and felt bad for Dounia. He showed Marfa Petrovna solid proof of Douniaâ€™s innocenceâ€”a letter she had to write for him before Marfa found them in the garden. This letter was her way of refusing personal talks and secret meetings he wanted. In it, she called him out for his awful behavior towards Marfa.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia faces public scorn and slander due to Marfa Petrovna's gossip, but ultimately her innocence is proven by Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov's intervention."
