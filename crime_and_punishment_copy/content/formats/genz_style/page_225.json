He had no clue and didn’t even want to think about it. Thoughts just tormented him. He knew he needed change—“one way or another,” he kept telling himself with stubborn determination.\n\nOut of habit, he walked toward the Hay Market. There, a dark-haired guy with a barrel organ played a sentimental tune. A girl, about fifteen, stood on the sidewalk in a worn-out crinoline, a mantle, and a straw hat with a bright feather. Her voice, rough from street singing, rang out as she hoped for coins from passersby. Raskolnikov joined a few others watching, pulled out a five copeck coin, and handed it to her. She abruptly cut off her song, shouted “Come on!” to the organ grinder, and they moved on to the next shop.\n\n“Do you like street music?” Raskolnikov asked a middle-aged man nearby. The man looked at him, surprised. \n\n“I love hearing songs from a street organ,” Raskolnikov added.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, in a moment of calm determination, resolves that his life must change immediately, despite not knowing how to achieve it."
