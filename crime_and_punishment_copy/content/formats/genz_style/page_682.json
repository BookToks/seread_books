  "text": "“Let’s get out of here,” Svidrigaïlov whispered. “I don’t want Rodion Romanovitch to find out we met. I just spent time with him at a nearby restaurant, and it was tough to shake him off. He’s caught wind of my letter to you and is suspicious. You didn’t tell him, right? But if not you, then who?”\n\n“Okay, we’ve turned the corner,” Dounia cut in. “My brother can’t see us now. I’m not going any further with you. Just talk to me here. You can say everything in the street.”\n\n“First off, I can’t say it out there. Second, you need to hear from Sofya Semyonovna too. And third, I have some papers to show you. If you won’t come with me, I’ll just walk away and not explain anything. But remember, I hold a pretty big secret about your brother.”\n\nDounia paused, eyeing Svidrigaïlov closely. \n\n“What are you scared of?” he asked calmly. “This isn’t the countryside. And even back then, you hurt me more than I hurt you.”\n\n“Have you talked to Sofya Semyonovna?”\n\n“Nope, I haven’t mentioned anything to her and I’m not sure if she’s home. She just buried her stepmother today, so she probably isn’t out visiting. Honestly, I wish I hadn’t even brought this up. One slip-up could ruin everything.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov urges Dounia to meet him privately to discuss a secret about her brother, Raskolnikov, while she remains hesitant and insists on not going further with him."
