  "text": "Rodion Romanovitch, chill out! No need to yell. I’ll call the clerks.  \n“You’re lying! Call them! You knew I was sick and tried to mess with my head to make me slip up. That was your plan! Show me your proof! I see right through you. You’ve got nothing but pathetic suspicions, just like Zametov! You knew who I am; you wanted to push me to my breaking point and then hit me with priests and deputies. Are you waiting for them? Where are they? Bring them out!”  \n“Why deputies? Seriously, what are people going to think? That’s not how this works, my friend. You don’t get it; you can’t escape the rules,” Porfiry said, listening at the door where noise was coming from.  \n“Oh, they’re coming!” Raskolnikov exclaimed. “You called for them! You were expecting them! Fine, bring them all: your deputies, your witnesses, whatever! I’m ready!”  \nBut then, something totally unexpected happened—something neither Raskolnikov nor Porfiry could have predicted for the end of their chat.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confronts Porfiry, accusing him of manipulation and demanding evidence against him, leading to an unexpected turn in their tense exchange."
