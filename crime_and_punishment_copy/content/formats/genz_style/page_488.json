  "text": "Raskolnikov was caught up in this mess, partly by accident. He felt guilty for giving the murderers a chance, and it messed with his head. He started imagining he was the murderer himself. Eventually, the High Court of Appeal looked into it, and he was cleared and put under care. Thank goodness for that! But seriously, man, you’re gonna lose it if you keep stressing yourself out, ringing bells at night, and obsessing over blood. I’ve seen this kind of mental strain before. Sometimes people feel like jumping out of windows or off towers. It’s all about your mental health, Rodion. You’ve been ignoring it. You need to see a real doctor—what’s the point of that useless guy? You’re not thinking straight! You were out of it when you did all that!\n\nFor a moment, Raskolnikov felt dizzy. “Is it possible he’s still lying?” he thought. “No way, he can’t be.” He pushed that thought away, knowing how furious it could make him. “I wasn’t out of it. I knew exactly what I was doing!” he shouted, trying hard to figure out Porfiry’s angle. “I was completely myself, got it?” \n\n“I hear you loud and clear. You insisted yesterday that you weren’t out of it—you were very adamant about it!” Porfiry replied. “I get everything you’re saying! A-ach! … Listen, Rodion…”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov grapples with his guilt and mental state after being indirectly involved in a murder, leading to a struggle between his sanity and the perception of his actions."
