  "text": "Amalia Ivanovna, or Amalia Ludwigovna, was furious. She slammed her fist on the table and yelled that she was Amalia Ivanovna, not Ludwigovna. She went on about her dad, Johann, being a burgomeister (a big deal back then), while she claimed Katerina Ivanovna’s dad was nothing special. \n\nKaterina Ivanovna stood up, looking pale but calm. She warned Amalia that if she ever compared her father to her own, she would rip her cap off and stomp on it. Amalia went wild, shouting that she was the boss of the house and Katerina had to leave right away. In a frenzy, she started grabbing silver spoons from the table. \n\nThe kids began to cry, and Sonia rushed to hold Katerina back. But when Amalia mentioned “the yellow ticket” (a reference to something shameful), Katerina shoved Sonia aside and charged at the landlady, ready to make good on her threat.\n\nJust then, the door swung open, and Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin stepped in, eyeing the chaos with a serious look. Katerina rushed over to him.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Amalia Ivanovna and Katerina Ivanovna engage in a heated confrontation over their social standings and the treatment of Katerina in her misfortune."
