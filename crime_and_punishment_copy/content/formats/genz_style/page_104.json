  "text": "He found an old, dirty shirt stuffed away under some linens. He ripped a long strip from it—about two inches wide and sixteen inches long. Folding it in half, he took off his only coat, a sturdy summer overcoat, and started sewing the rag inside, under the left armhole. His hands shook, but he managed to stitch it up so well that nothing showed on the outside when he put the coat back on. \n\nHe had the needle and thread ready on his table, wrapped in paper. Now, about that noose—it was a clever little invention of his. He needed it for the axe. Carrying the axe openly on the street was a no-go. Even if he hid it under his coat, he would have to support it with his hand, which would draw attention. With the noose, he could just slip the axe’s head in, and it would hang quietly under his arm. By keeping his hand in his coat pocket, he could grip the handle without it swinging around. Plus, his coat was so baggy that no one would notice he was holding something. He had actually designed this noose two weeks earlier.\n\nOnce that was done, he reached into a gap between the sofa and the floor, fumbled around, and pulled out a hidden item he had stashed away. It was just a piece of wood, smooth and the size of a silver cigarette case. He had found it during one of his aimless walks in a courtyard.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist ingeniously prepares to conceal an axe under his coat using a noose he designed, demonstrating his troubled state of mind and intentions."
