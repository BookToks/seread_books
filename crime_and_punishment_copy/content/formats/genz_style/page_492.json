  "text": "Raskolnikov pushed Porfiry back a bit and demanded, “Do you think I’m totally free from suspicion or not? Just tell me, Porfiry Petrovitch, and do it fast!”\n\nPorfiry chuckled, looking all calm and sly. “What a situation we’re in! Why do you care so much? They’re not even bothering you. You’re like a kid asking for matches! Why so anxious? Why are you pushing yourself on us, huh? He-he-he!”\n\n“I’m telling you,” Raskolnikov shot back, furious, “I can’t handle this!”\n\n“Handle what? The uncertainty?” Porfiry interrupted.\n\n“Don’t mock me! I won’t stand for it! I can’t and I won’t, do you hear?” He slammed his fist on the table.\n\n“Shh! They’ll hear you! Seriously, watch yourself. I’m not joking,” Porfiry whispered. This time, he wasn’t playing around. He looked serious, stern, and a bit intimidating.\n\nBut that didn’t last long. Raskolnikov, confused and furious, suddenly went into a frenzy. Yet, oddly enough, he kept his voice down, even though he was boiling inside. \n\n“I won’t let you torture me,” he whispered, hating that he felt forced to obey. The thought only fueled his anger more. “Arrest me, search me, but just do it properly.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov demands clarity from Porfiry about his innocence while struggling with intense anxiety and fury over the uncertainty of his situation."
