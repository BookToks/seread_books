  "text": "She could totally be called beautiful. Her dark brown hair was just a shade lighter than her brother's. There was this proud spark in her almost black eyes, but sometimes they showed an incredible kindness. She was pale, but in a healthy way; her face radiated freshness and energy. Her mouth was small, with a full red lower lip that stuck out a bit, along with her chin. It was the only flaw in her stunning face, but it gave her a unique, almost haughty vibe. \n\nHer expression was usually more serious and thoughtful than cheerful, but when she smiled or laughed, it lit up her whole face! It’s no wonder that a big-hearted guy like Razumihin, who had never met anyone like her and was a bit tipsy, completely lost his mind over her. Plus, he first saw Dounia glowing with love for her brother and her joy at seeing him. Later, he witnessed her lower lip quiver with anger at her brother's rude and ungrateful words—and that sealed his fate.\n\nHe was right when he drunkenly said on the stairs that Raskolnikov’s quirky landlady, Praskovya Pavlovna, would be jealous of Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Avdotya Romanovna because of him. Even at forty-three, Pulcheria still showed signs of her past beauty; she looked way younger than her age. This is often true for women who keep a calm spirit, sensitivity, and a warm heart as they age. (It's all about that inner glow!)\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia is portrayed as a beautiful and strong character, whose complex emotions and relationships, particularly with her brother and Razumihin, reveal her depth and individuality."
