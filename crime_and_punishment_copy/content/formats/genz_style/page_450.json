I wanted to go see Katerina Ivanovna….”\n\n“You were walking in the streets?” \n\n“Yeah,” Sonia said quietly, looking down, clearly flustered.\n\n“Katerina Ivanovna used to hit you, right?”\n\n“Oh no, what are you talking about? No!” Sonia replied, her eyes wide with disbelief.\n\n“So you love her then?”\n\n“Love her? Of course!” Sonia exclaimed, her voice filled with emotion as she clasped her hands in distress. “Ah, if you only knew! She’s like a child….” \n\nHer voice dropped, “Her mind is all messed up from sorrow. She used to be so clever, so generous, so kind! You don’t get it, you really don’t!” \n\nSonia spoke with desperation, her hands wringing together in agitation. Her pale cheeks flushed, and anguish filled her eyes. It was clear she was deeply affected and eager to defend Katerina, to express her feelings. An overwhelming compassion shone through every feature of her face.\n\n“Beat me? How could you say that? Good heavens, beat me! And if she did, so what? You know nothing about it…. She’s so unhappy… oh, so unhappy! And sick… She’s searching for righteousness; she’s pure. She believes there has to be goodness everywhere.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia expresses deep compassion for Katerina Ivanovna, emphasizing her suffering and innocence despite her mental instability."
