He struggled to speak, moving his tongue awkwardly. Katerina Ivanovna sensed he wanted to apologize and said firmly, “Be silent! No need! I know what you want to say!” He fell silent, but his eyes wandered to the doorway and landed on Sonia.\n\nHe hadn’t noticed her before; she was lurking in the shadows. “Who’s that? Who’s that?” he gasped, panic rising as he turned toward the door, trying to sit up. \n\n“Lie down! Lie down!” Katerina Ivanovna urged. \n\nWith surprising strength, he propped himself up on his elbow. He stared at Sonia for a long moment, not recognizing her at first. She looked different, dressed in her flashy clothes, embarrassed and waiting to say goodbye to her dying father. His face twisted in pain. \n\n“Sonia! Daughter! Forgive!” he cried, reaching out for her. But he lost his balance and fell off the sofa, hitting the floor. They rushed to lift him back up, but it was clear he was slipping away. Sonia was there, heartbroken.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marmeladov, in his final moments, seeks forgiveness from his daughter Sonia while Katerina Ivanovna urges him to remain silent."
