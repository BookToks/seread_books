The head clerk smiled, while the angry assistant superintendent looked thrown off. \n\n\"That's none of your business!\" he finally yelled, way too loud. \"Just give the statement we need. Show him, Alexandr Grigorievitch. You’ve got a complaint against you! You don’t pay your debts! What a great guy!\" \n\nBut Raskolnikov wasn’t paying attention anymore. He grabbed the paper, eager to figure out what was going on. He read it once, then again, but still didn’t get it. \n\n\"What is this?\" he asked the head clerk. \n\n\"It’s a notice for recovering money on an I O U, a writ. You either pay up, including all the costs, or you give a written statement saying when you can pay, plus a promise not to leave the city without settling this, and not to sell or hide your stuff. Your creditor can sell your property and take legal action against you.\" \n\n\"But I’m not in debt to anyone!\" \n\n\"That’s not our problem. Here’s an I O U for one hundred and fifteen roubles, legally signed, due for payment. It was given by you to the widow of the assessor Zarnitsyn nine months ago and transferred to Mr. Tchebarov. So, we’re summoning you.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is confronted with a legal notice regarding a debt he claims he does not owe."
