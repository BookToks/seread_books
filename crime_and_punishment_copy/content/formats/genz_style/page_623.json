They’ve had secret talks! She hinted at it too… so many of her words had that vibe! How else can all this drama make sense? Wow, what was I thinking? I really lost it and misjudged him! It was his influence, that day by the lamp in the hallway. Ugh! What a dumb, gross idea that was! Nikolay is a champ for owning up… and now it all makes sense!
