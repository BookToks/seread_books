  "text": "Pyotr Petrovitch was worried. He knew a fight had almost blown up between two people, and he wanted to dig into it as soon as he got to Petersburg. He thought it’d be smart to cozy up to “the younger generation” (you know, the trendsetters). He was counting on Andrey Semyonovitch for that. Before visiting Raskolnikov, he picked up some trendy phrases to sound in-the-know.\n\nBut he quickly realized Andrey was just a basic dude—kind of clueless. Still, that didn’t ease Pyotr’s nerves. Even if all the progressives were as dull as Andrey, he still felt uneasy. All the ideas and theories Andrey threw at him? Total snooze-fest. Pyotr had one goal: figure out what was going on. Did these people hold any power? Should he be worried? Would they expose his plans? What were they even attacking? \n\nHe needed to know if he could win them over, or if they were a threat. Could he get something out of them? So many questions were swirling in his mind.\n\nAndrey Semyonovitch was a frail little guy, sickly with a weird pride in his fluffy mutton-chop whiskers. He was a clerk, often squinting because of his poor eyesight. He was soft-hearted but also pretty full of himself, which came off as silly given his tiny stature. Amalia Ivanovna, the landlady, liked him because he didn’t drink much and always paid his rent on time.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pyotr Petrovitch is anxious about the influence of the younger generation and seeks to navigate their potential power while relying on the simple-minded Andrey Semyonovitch for guidance."
