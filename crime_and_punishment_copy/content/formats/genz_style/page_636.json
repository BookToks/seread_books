  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nSo, Rodion Romanovitch, let’s talk about the word “suffering.” Some people really cling to it! It’s not about suffering for others; it’s just “one must suffer.” If they’re getting hurt by the authorities, even better. I remember this one prisoner from back in the day. He was super chill and spent a whole year in jail just reading his Bible at night. He read so much that he kind of lost it. One day, out of nowhere, he grabbed a brick and threw it at the governor—totally missed on purpose, though. He didn’t want to hurt anyone. But, you know what happens when a prisoner attacks an officer. So, he just went ahead and “took his suffering.”\n\nNow, I think Nikolay wants to “take his suffering” too. I know this for sure because of what I’ve seen. He doesn’t even realize I know. You don’t think there are weirdos like this among the peasants? There are plenty! The elder has been getting into his head, especially since Nikolay tried to hang himself. But he’ll come to me and spill everything. You think he’ll keep quiet? Just wait; he’ll change his mind. I’m on the lookout for him to come back and take back what he said. I’ve started to like Nikolay and am really paying attention to him. And guess what? He made some solid points when we talked. He clearly did his homework. But on other stuff? He’s totally lost and has no clue.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The discussion revolves around the concept of suffering among individuals, particularly in the context of a prisoner influenced by religious beliefs and the expectations of enduring hardship."
