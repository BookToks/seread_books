  "text": "**Crime and Punishment: Translator’s Preface**\n\nHere’s a bit about Dostoevsky that might help you get his vibe. \n\nHe was born to a doctor and had super hard-working, religious parents. They were so broke that they crammed their five kids into just two rooms. But they made it work, spending evenings reading serious books together.\n\nDostoevsky was always sickly but still managed to snag third place in his final exams at the Petersburg school of Engineering. It was there he kicked off his writing career with ‘Poor Folk.’ \n\nThat story got published by the poet Nekrassov in his review and blew up. Suddenly, this shy kid was a bit of a celebrity. A bright future seemed to be in the cards, but then everything changed. In 1849, he was arrested. \n\nEven though he wasn’t a revolutionary by nature, he hung out with a small group of guys who read thinkers like Fourier and Proudhon. He got accused of chatting against censorship, reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and knowing about plans for a printing press. This all happened under the rule of Nicholas I.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dostoevsky, despite his promising beginnings as a writer, faced arrest in 1849 for his involvement in discussions against censorship."
