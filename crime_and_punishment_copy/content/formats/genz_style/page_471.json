  "text": "The day before, Raskolnikov felt like a total ghost, his mind playing tricks on him because he was so stressed. This idea started creeping in when he was freaking out and feeling hopeless. Now, as he braced for another showdown, he noticed he was shaking. The thought of trembling in front of the annoying Porfiry Petrovitch made him mad. He loathed that guy with a passion and worried his anger might give him away. But that anger snapped him out of it. He decided to walk in with an icy, confident vibe and promised himself to keep quiet, observe, and finally get a grip on his nerves. Just then, he was called in to see Porfiry.\n\nInside Porfiry's study, it was a pretty standard setup—neither too big nor too small. There was a big writing desk, a sofa with a checkered pattern, a bureau, a bookcase stuffed in the corner, and some chairs—all that polished yellow wood you see in government offices. A closed door on the far wall probably led to more rooms. When Raskolnikov walked in, Porfiry quickly shut the door behind him. He greeted Raskolnikov with a friendly smile, but after a few minutes, Raskolnikov noticed Porfiry seemed a bit off, like he was caught off guard or hiding something shady.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels intense hatred and fear towards Porfiry Petrovitch as he prepares to confront him in a tense meeting."
