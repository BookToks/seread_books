  "text": "Raskolnikov felt a rush when he saw his work in print for the first time. But it faded fast. After reading a few lines, he frowned, feeling a wave of pain. He remembered the struggle he’d been through for months. In frustration, he tossed the article on the table.\n\n“Look, Rodya,” his mother said, “I may not be the brightest, but I can see you’re going to be a big deal in Russian thought. They thought you were crazy! Can you believe that? Those clueless people don’t get genius! And Dounia almost believed them too—what do you think of that? Your father tried twice to get published—first with poems (I still have the manuscript) and then a whole novel (I begged him to let me copy it). We hoped so hard they’d get accepted, but they didn’t! I was so worried about you—your food, your clothes, how you’re living. But now I realize how silly I was. You can achieve anything with your smarts and talent. I know you might not care about that right now, though. You have bigger things on your mind…”\n\n“Is Dounia not home?” he asked.\n\n“No, Rodya. She often leaves me by myself. Dmitri Prokofitch comes to visit, which is nice. He always talks about you. He really cares about you, my dear. I’m not saying Dounia doesn’t care; she just has her own way of doing things.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's mother expresses her belief in his potential for greatness despite her worries about his current struggles."
