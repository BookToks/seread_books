The room felt stuffy; she hadn’t opened the window. A nasty smell wafted up from the stairs, but the door was wide open. Smoke from the inner rooms filled the air. She coughed but didn’t bother to shut the door.\n\nOn the floor, her youngest child, a six-year-old girl, was asleep, curled up with her head resting on the sofa. A boy, just a year older, was crying and shaking in the corner, likely fresh from a beating. Next to him stood a nine-year-old girl, tall and skinny, wearing a ragged chemise and an old cashmere coat that barely reached her knees. Her stick-thin arm was wrapped around her brother’s neck as she tried to comfort him, whispering softly to stop his whimpering. Yet her large, dark eyes, which looked even bigger on her gaunt face, were anxiously watching their mother.\n\nMarmeladov didn’t step inside; he dropped to his knees right in the doorway, pushing Raskolnikov ahead of him. The woman noticed the stranger and paused, as if coming back to reality, confused about why he was there. But she quickly assumed he was just passing through to the next room. Ignoring him, she moved toward the outer door to close it and suddenly screamed.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marmeladov's wife is lost in thought amidst the chaos of their impoverished home, while their children display signs of distress."
