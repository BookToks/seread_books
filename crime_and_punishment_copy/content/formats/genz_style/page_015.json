He realized he had nowhere else to go and had another reason for being there. \n\n“Hand it over,” he said, sounding rough. \n\nThe old woman fumbled for her keys and slipped behind the curtain into the other room. He stood there, curious and thinking. He could hear her unlocking the chest of drawers. \n\n“It must be the top drawer,” he thought. “She keeps the keys in her right pocket, all on one steel ring. But there’s one key that’s way bigger than the rest, with deep notches. That can’t be for the chest of drawers. There’s gotta be another box or something. That’s good to know. Strong-boxes always have keys like that... but this is all so degrading.” \n\nThe old woman returned. \n\n“Here you go, sir. We say ten copecks per rouble a month, so I need fifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance. For the two roubles I lent you earlier, you owe me twenty copecks on the same terms. That’s thirty-five copecks total. So I’ll give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the watch. Here it is.” \n\n“What? Only a rouble and fifteen copecks?” \n\n“Yep.” \n\nHe didn’t argue. He took the money and looked at her, lingering as if he still had something to say.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The young man reluctantly pawns his watch to the old woman while contemplating her possessions and the degrading nature of the transaction."
