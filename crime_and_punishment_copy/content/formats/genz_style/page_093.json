But he couldn’t stop wondering: why did this super important, life-changing meeting happen in the Hay Market? (He had zero reason to be there.) And why at that exact moment when it could totally change his fate? It felt like the universe was waiting for him.\n\nAround nine o’clock, he crossed through the Hay Market. The vendors were closing up shop, packing their stuff, and heading home. Rag pickers and street sellers were hanging out near the taverns in the grimy courtyards. Raskolnikov liked this place and the nearby alleys. Here, his shabby clothes didn’t get him weird looks, and he could roam around without causing a scene.\n\nAt the alley corner, a vendor and his wife had two tables set up with tapes, thread, and cotton handkerchiefs. They were about to leave but stuck around to chat with a friend who just showed up. That friend was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or Lizaveta for short—the younger sister of the old pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna. Raskolnikov had just been to see her the day before to pawn his watch and test his theory…\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reflects on the significance of a chance meeting in the Hay Market that could profoundly impact his destiny."
