  "text": "\"Listen up, everyone! I’ve got something important to say. This guy (he pointed at Luzhin) was supposed to marry my sister, Avdotya Romanovna Raskolnikov. But when he came to Petersburg, we had a huge fight two days ago, and I kicked him out of my room. I’ve got two witnesses to back me up. He’s a really spiteful dude. \n\nTwo days ago, I had no idea he was staying here in your room. So, on the same day we fought, he saw me give Katerina Ivanovna some cash for a funeral (it was for a friend who passed away). Then he wrote to my mom, claiming I gave all my money to Sofya Semyonovna instead, and he insulted her character. His goal? To drive a wedge between me and my family by making it seem like I was wasting their money on someone unworthy. \n\nLast night, in front of my mom, sister, and him, I set the record straight. I told them I gave the money to Katerina Ivanovna, not to Sofya Semyonovna, and that I didn’t even know Sofya. Plus, I made it clear that Luzhin, despite his so-called virtues, isn’t worth even a tiny bit of Sofya Semyonovna. He really talked trash about her.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov defends Sofya Semyonovna against Luzhin's malicious accusations, asserting his integrity and the truth about his financial dealings."
