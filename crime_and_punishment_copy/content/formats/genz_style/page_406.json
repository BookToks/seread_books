When I walked in and saw you pretending to sleep, I thought, “Here’s the man.”’  \n‘What do you mean by “the man?” What are you talking about?’ Raskolnikov shot back.  \n‘Honestly? I’m not sure…’ Svidrigaïlov said, looking just as confused.  \n\nThey paused, staring at each other.  \n‘This is nonsense!’ Raskolnikov snapped, annoyed. ‘What does she say when she visits you?’  \n‘She! You won’t believe it—she talks about the most trivial stuff, and it drives me crazy. The first time she showed up, I was exhausted from the funeral and all that. Finally, I was alone in my study, lit a cigar, and started thinking. Then she walked in and said, “You’ve been so busy today, Arkady Ivanovitch, you forgot to wind the dining-room clock.” I wound that thing every week for seven years, and she always reminded me if I didn’t.  \n\nThe next day, I was on my way here, half-asleep with coffee in hand. I looked up, and there was Marfa Petrovna sitting next to me with a deck of cards. “Want me to tell your fortune for the trip, Arkady Ivanovitch?” She was really good at that. I still regret not asking her to do it. But I panicked and ran off when the bell rang. 😅\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov describes his encounters with the ghost of his deceased wife, Marfa Petrovna, who engages him in trivial conversations."
