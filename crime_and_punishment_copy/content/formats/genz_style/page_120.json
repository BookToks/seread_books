Then he distinctly heard a faint cry, like someone moaning softly. After a minute of silence, he squatted by the box, holding his breath. Suddenly, he jumped up, grabbed the axe, and bolted out of the bedroom.\n\nIn the middle of the room stood Lizaveta, holding a big bundle. She looked shocked, pale as a ghost, and seemed too stunned to scream. When she saw him rush out, she started trembling, like a leaf in the wind. She raised her hand and opened her mouth, but no sound came out—like she couldn’t catch her breath. She slowly backed into a corner, staring at him, her eyes wide, still silent.\n\nHe lunged at her with the axe. Her mouth twitched, like a scared baby about to cry. Lizaveta was so innocent and terrified that she didn’t even try to protect herself. Instead, she raised her empty left hand, not to shield her face, but as if she was trying to push him away. The axe came down hard, striking her skull and splitting it open.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, in a state of panic, confronts Lizaveta after committing murder, leading to a violent and tragic encounter."
