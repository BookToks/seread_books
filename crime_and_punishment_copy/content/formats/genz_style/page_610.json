  "text": "Polenka collapsed at her mom's feet, crying hard and kissing them. Kolya and Lida didn’t get what just happened, but they felt it was really bad. They clutched each other’s shoulders, wide-eyed, and both started screaming. They were still in their fancy outfits—one in a turban, the other in a feathered cap. \n\nAnd what was the \"certificate of merit\" doing on the bed next to Katerina Ivanovna? Raskolnikov spotted it lying by the pillow. \n\nHe turned and walked to the window. Lebeziatnikov bounced over to him. \n\n“She’s dead,” he said.\n\n“Rodion Romanovitch, I need to talk to you,” Svidrigaïlov said, approaching them. Lebeziatnikov quickly stepped aside. Svidrigaïlov pulled Raskolnikov further away.\n\n“I’ll handle everything for the funeral. It’s about money, and I’ve got plenty. I’ll make sure those two little ones and Polenka get into a good orphanage. I’ll set aside fifteen hundred roubles for each of them when they turn 18, so Sofya Semyonovna won’t have to worry. And I’ll help her out too; she’s a good girl, right? Just tell Avdotya Romanovna that’s how I’m using her ten grand.”\n\n“What’s behind your generosity?” Raskolnikov asked.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Polenka and the children react with horror to their mother's death, while Svidrigaïlov offers to arrange her funeral and support the orphans financially."
