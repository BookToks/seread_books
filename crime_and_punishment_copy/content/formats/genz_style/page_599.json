  "text": "Sofya Semyonovna has pulled off her plan and taken the kids. We’ve been scrambling to find them. She’s banging on a frying pan, trying to get the kids to dance. They’re crying, stopping at every crossroad and shop, while a bunch of onlookers chase after them. Let’s go! \n\n“And Sonia?” Raskolnikov asked, clearly worried as he hurried after Lebeziatnikov.\n\n“She’s going nuts. Well, it’s Katerina Ivanovna who’s really losing it, but Sofya Semyonovna is stressed too. Katerina is completely frantic. I mean, she’s practically mad. If they get taken to the police, you can imagine the chaos that will cause… They’re by the canal now, near the bridge, close to where Sofya lives.”\n\nAt the canal, just a couple of houses from Sonia's place, a crowd of street kids had gathered. You could hear Katerina Ivanovna’s hoarse voice from the bridge—it was definitely a scene that would draw a crowd. Katerina, in her old dress and a tattered green shawl, looked wild. Her straw hat was all messed up on one side. She was exhausted and out of breath. Her sickly face looked even worse in the sunlight. But her energy didn’t fade; if anything, she got more worked up. She ran at the kids, yelling, coaxing, and trying to show them how to dance in front of everyone.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna is in a frantic state, desperately trying to manage the children and attract attention from the crowd."
