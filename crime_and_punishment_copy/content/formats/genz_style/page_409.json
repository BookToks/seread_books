If you believe in life after death, why not that too? \n\n“I don’t believe in life after death,” Raskolnikov replied.\n\nSvidrigaïlov fell silent, deep in thought. \n\n“What if it’s just filled with spiders or something weird?” he suddenly said. \n\n“He’s lost it,” Raskolnikov thought. \n\n“We picture eternity as this huge, endless thing, right? But what if it’s just a tiny, grimy room, like a dirty bathhouse, with spiders everywhere? What if that’s all there is?” \n\n“Seriously? That’s the best you can come up with?” Raskolnikov shot back, feeling a wave of despair. \n\n“Best? Who knows? Maybe that is fair, and honestly, I might’ve made it that way,” Svidrigaïlov said with a strange smile. \n\nRaskolnikov felt a chill run down his spine. Svidrigaïlov looked at him and suddenly burst out laughing. \n\n“Can you believe it? Just half an hour ago, we didn’t even know each other, thought we were enemies! We’ve got some unresolved stuff, but look at us now, diving into the deep stuff! Guess I was right—we really are alike!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov and Svidrigaïlov engage in a philosophical discussion about the nature of eternity and the afterlife, revealing their contrasting beliefs."
