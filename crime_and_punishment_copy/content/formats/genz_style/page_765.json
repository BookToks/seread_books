She jumped up, trembling, but then she got it. A spark of pure joy lit up her eyes. She knew he loved her more than anything, and finally, the moment had come.\n\nThey wanted to talk but couldn’t; tears filled their eyes. They both looked sickly, pale, but those faces shone with hope for a new future—a full rebirth into life. Their love renewed them; each held endless life for the other.\n\nThey decided to wait and be patient. They had seven more years ahead of them, filled with both pain and joy. But he felt like he had risen again, and she? She lived through him.\n\nThat evening, after the barracks were locked up, Raskolnikov lay on his hard bed, thinking about her. He even imagined that the other convicts, who used to be his enemies, looked at him differently now. He had talked to them, and they responded kindly. He remembered that and thought it had to mean something. Wasn’t everything bound to change now?\n\nHe thought of her again. He recalled how much he had hurt her and tormented her heart.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a profound emotional awakening and connection with a woman he loves, signaling hope for a renewed future despite their past suffering."
