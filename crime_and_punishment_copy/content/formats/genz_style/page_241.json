  "text": "“Let me go!” Raskolnikov said, trying to push past Razumihin. But Razumihin wasn’t having it; he grabbed Raskolnikov’s shoulder tightly.\n\n“Let you go? You think you can just walk away? I’ll scoop you up, bundle you up, and carry you home like a package! Then I’ll lock you in!” \n\n“Listen, Razumihin,” Raskolnikov replied, trying to stay calm. “Can’t you see I don’t want your help? It’s strange that you want to shower kindness on someone who hates it and feels it’s a burden! Why did you even come to me when I was sick? Maybe I wanted to just fade away. Didn’t I tell you earlier that you’re torturing me? I’m sick of you! It seems like you enjoy making people suffer! This is messing with my recovery because it just irritates me. You saw Zossimov leave to avoid bothering me. Please, just leave me alone! What right do you have to keep me here against my will? Can’t you see I’m fully aware now? How can I convince you to stop smothering me with your kindness? I might be ungrateful or mean, but just let me be! For the love of God, let me be! Let me be, let me be!”\n\nHe started off calm, but his words turned into a frenzy, just like they had with Luzhin. Razumihin paused, thought for a second, and then let his hand fall.\n\n“Fine, go to hell then,” he said softly and thoughtfully.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses his frustration with Razumihin's attempts to help him, insisting that he prefers solitude over unwanted kindness."
