  "text": "A fancy country cottage in the English style, overflowing with sweet-smelling flowers. Flower beds wrapped around the house, and the porch was draped in climbing plants, surrounded by rose bushes. Inside, a light staircase covered in plush rugs led up to rare plants in decorative pots. He couldn’t help but notice the windows adorned with delicate, fragrant narcissus flowers, their long green stems bending under their weight. He wanted to linger, but he eventually climbed the stairs to a spacious drawing-room filled with flowers everywhere—at the windows, the balcony doors, and on the balcony itself. \n\nThe floor was scattered with freshly cut hay, and the windows were flung open, letting in a cool breeze. Birds chirped outside, but in the center of the room, on a table draped with white satin, was a coffin. It was covered in white silk and edged with a thick white frill, surrounded by floral wreaths. Inside lay a girl in a white muslin dress, arms crossed over her chest as if she were made of marble. Her hair was loose and damp, and a wreath of roses rested on her head. \n\nHer face, stern and already stiff, looked chiseled from marble too, and the smile on her pale lips held a deep, unchildlike sadness and a silent plea. Svidrigaïlov recognized her. There were no religious symbols, no candles burning beside the coffin, and no prayers being said: this girl had drowned herself. She was only fourteen, but her heart was shattered. She had taken her life, crushed by an insult that left everyone shocked.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov discovers a coffin in a beautifully adorned room, revealing the tragic fate of a young girl who drowned herself in despair."
