  "text": "To me, it’s crucial that some people are controlled. It’s their role, and honestly, there’s nothing degrading about it. The second group, though? They break the law. They’re either destructive or have a tendency to cause destruction, depending on their abilities. Their crimes vary widely; most are trying to tear down the old for something better. But if someone feels they must step over a body or get their hands dirty for their beliefs, they can find a way to justify it in their conscience—this really depends on the idea and how big it is, just so you know.\n\nThat’s what I meant when I talked about their \"right\" to commit crimes in my article (remember, it kicked off with a legal debate). But honestly, there’s no need to stress about it; the masses usually don’t accept this right. They punish or even execute these people (more or less), and that’s them doing their conservative duty. Ironically, in the next generation, those same masses often idolize these criminals. \n\nThe first group represents the present, while the second is all about the future. The first keeps the world running, and the second pushes it toward its goals. Both groups have a right to exist. In fact, everyone has equal rights, including me—and long live the eternal struggle—until we reach the New Jerusalem, of course! \n\n“Do you really believe in the New Jerusalem?” \n\n“I do,” Raskolnikov replied firmly, keeping his gaze fixed on a spot on the carpet as he spoke.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The text discusses the distinction between two categories of individuals: those who uphold the law and those who transgress it for the sake of a greater idea, suggesting that both have a right to exist and contribute to societal progress."
