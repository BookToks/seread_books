  "text": "Raskolnikov noticed her pale face, and tears filled her eyes. She felt a mix of sickness, shame, and a strange happiness. He quickly turned away and sat at the table, scanning the room in a flash.\n\nSonia’s place was big but super low. It was the only room rented out by the Kapernaumovs, with a closed door on the left leading to their space. On the right, another door was locked, blocking access to the next flat. Sonia's room looked like a barn—oddly shaped and kind of awkward. One wall had three windows facing the canal, but they were slanted, making it hard to see without bright light. The other corner was way too wide. \n\nFurniture? Almost none. There was a bed in one corner, a chair near the door, and a plain table covered with a blue cloth against the wall. Two rush-bottom chairs were by the table. On the opposite wall, near the sharp angle, stood a small, plain chest of drawers that seemed lost in the space. That was it. The yellow wallpaper was scratched and shabby, with black corners. It probably got damp and smelled bad in winter. Everything screamed poverty; even the bed had no curtain.\n\nSonia watched Raskolnikov as he examined her room, trembling with fear, as if he was uncovering something he shouldn’t.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov visits Sonia's impoverished and dismal room, reflecting the starkness of her living conditions."
