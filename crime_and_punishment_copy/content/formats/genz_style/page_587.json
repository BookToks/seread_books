  "text": "I’ve replayed everything in my head, lying in the dark, over and over. I know every detail, and honestly, I was sick of it. I wanted to forget and start fresh, Sonia. I didn’t dive in blindly; I thought it through, and that’s what messed me up. \n\nDon’t think I didn’t realize that questioning whether I had the right to gain power meant I didn’t. If I wondered if a person was just a louse, it showed I wasn’t ready to act like someone who goes for their goals without second-guessing. \n\nI spent days stressing about whether Napoleon would have done it. Deep down, I knew I wasn’t him. I had to deal with all that mental turmoil, and I just wanted to escape it. I wanted to kill without overthinking, for my own reasons. I didn’t want to lie to myself. \n\nIt wasn’t for my mom that I committed murder—that’s just nonsense. I didn’t do it to gain wealth or to help humanity. I did it for me, plain and simple. Whether I ended up helping others or just trapping people like a spider, I didn’t care at that moment. And it wasn’t really about the money, Sonia. There was something deeper driving me. I get it all now.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reflects on his motivations for murder, admitting it was for himself alone rather than for any noble cause."
