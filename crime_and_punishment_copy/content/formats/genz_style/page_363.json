They just drifted into deep questions and floated off,” Raskolnikov replied casually.\n\n“Can you believe what we ended up discussing? Whether crime even exists. We talked until we were exhausted,” Razumihin said.\n\n“What’s so weird about that? It’s a common social issue,” Raskolnikov shot back.\n\n“Not exactly how it was framed,” Porfiry chimed in.\n\n“True, but that’s not the point,” Razumihin jumped in, getting excited. “Listen, Rodion, I want your take. I was arguing hard with them and wanted you to back me up. I told them you were coming... It all started with the socialist view. You know how they think: crime is just a reaction to how messed up society is. Nothing else matters to them!”\n\n“You’re wrong there,” Porfiry interjected, clearly fired up and laughing at Razumihin, which made him even more animated.\n\n“Nothing else counts!” Razumihin insisted hotly.\n\n“I’m not mistaken. I’ll show you their pamphlets. They believe everything is about ‘the influence of environment’—that’s their go-to phrase!
