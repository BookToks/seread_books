  "text": "Svidrigaïlov was feeling a bit off after losing something important at the Vauxhall. He paid for a spoon, got up, and left the garden. It was around six o'clock. He hadn’t touched any wine and had only ordered tea to keep up appearances. \n\nThe evening was dark and heavy. By ten o'clock, storm clouds rolled in. Thunder crashed, and rain poured down like a waterfall—no gentle drops here, just sheets of water. Lightning flashed every minute, and each burst lasted long enough to count to five. \n\nSoaked to the bone, he headed home, locked himself in, and opened his bureau. He pulled out all his cash and ripped up a couple of papers. Just as he was about to change clothes, he paused to listen to the storm. Instead of getting dressed, he grabbed his hat and left without locking the door. He went straight to Sonia’s place. \n\nWhen he arrived, Sonia was home but not alone. The four Kapernaumov kids were there, and she was serving them tea. She greeted Svidrigaïlov quietly, her eyes wide at his drenched clothes. The kids bolted in fear as soon as they saw him. \n\nSvidrigaïlov sat at the table and asked Sonia to join him. She nervously prepared to hear him out. \n\n“I might be heading to America, Sofya Semyonovna,” he said. “Since this could be our last meeting, I wanted to sort a few things out.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov visits Sonia to discuss his potential departure to America and make arrangements, while a storm rages outside."
