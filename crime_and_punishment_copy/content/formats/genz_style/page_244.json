  "text": "Raskolnikov leaned on the rail, staring into the distance. After parting with Razumihin, he felt so weak he could barely make it to this spot. He wanted to sit or lie down right there on the street. \n\nHe bent over the water, staring blankly at the last pink glow of sunset. The houses were fading into darkness as twilight set in. He noticed a distant attic window on the left bank, glowing like it was on fire in the last light. The dark water of the canal caught his eye. Suddenly, red circles flashed before him, and everything—the houses, the people, the canal banks, the carriages—seemed to swirl around. \n\nThen, he jolted back to reality, maybe saved from fainting by a creepy sight. He turned and saw a tall woman with a kerchief on her head. Her long, yellow face looked wasted, and her sunken red eyes stared blankly at him, as if she didn’t see him at all. \n\nOut of nowhere, she leaned on the parapet, swung her right leg over the railing, then her left, and jumped into the canal. The filthy water splashed as it swallowed her up, but she quickly floated back to the surface, moving slowly with the current. Her head and legs were submerged, while her skirt puffed up like a balloon behind her.\n\n“Woman drowning! Woman drowning!” shouted dozens of voices. People rushed over, crowding both banks, and on the bridge, a throng surrounded Raskolnikov, pushing in closer.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, feeling weak and disoriented, witnesses a woman throw herself into the canal, prompting a crowd to react in alarm."
