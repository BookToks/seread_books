  "text": "Raskolnikov had stashed the jewelry and purse under a stone without ever using them. He couldn’t even remember what the jewelry looked like or how much cash was in the purse. It seemed wild that he’d never peeked inside. Turns out, the purse held three hundred and seventeen roubles and sixty copecks. But since it had been hidden for so long, some of the bills got damp and damaged.\n\nLawyers were puzzled about why he’d lie about this when he was honest about everything else. Eventually, some smart lawyers suggested he might not have actually looked inside the purse before hiding it. This led them to think he must have been in a temporary mental state—basically, he lost it for a moment and didn’t commit the crime for any real reason or gain. This idea fit right in with the trendy theory of temporary insanity that was popular in criminal cases at the time.\n\nPlus, witnesses like Dr. Zossimov, his old classmates, and even his landlady and her servant all said he was in a pretty bad mental state. This pointed to the idea that Raskolnikov wasn’t your typical murderer and robber; there was more going on here. \n\nDespite this, he barely tried to defend himself. When asked what drove him to commit the crime, he didn’t have much to say.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's confession and the circumstances of his crime suggest a complex interplay of mental derangement and poverty rather than straightforward criminal intent."
