The table looked nice for a change—like, it was actually clean.\n\n“Hey, Nastasya, it wouldn’t hurt to have a couple of bottles of beer sent up. We could finish them off,” he said.\n\n“Wow, you’re bold,” Nastasya muttered before heading off to get the beer.\n\nRaskolnikov was still staring off into space, super tense. Meanwhile, Razumihin plopped down on the sofa next to him, awkwardly wrapping his left arm around Raskolnikov’s head. He held a spoonful of soup in his right hand, blowing on it so it wouldn’t burn him. But the soup was only lukewarm. Raskolnikov gulped down one spoonful, then another, then a third. But after a few more bites, Razumihin paused and said he needed to check with Zossimov about whether Raskolnikov should have more.\n\nNastasya came back with two bottles of beer. \n\n“And do you want tea?” she asked.\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“Alright, Nastasya, go grab some tea. We can handle that without a doctor’s approval. But here’s the beer!” He scooted back to his chair, pulled the soup and meat closer, and started eating like he hadn’t had a meal in three days. \n\n“I’ve got to tell you, Rodya, this is how I eat here every day.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is being cared for by Razumihin, who provides him with soup and beer as they share a moment of camaraderie."
