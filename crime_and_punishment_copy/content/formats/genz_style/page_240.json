  "text": "Raskolnikov was in this wild state, feeling both ecstatic and totally drained. His face looked like he’d just had a meltdown. He was exhausted, and it showed. Any little thing could jolt him back to life, but once that wore off, he was back to feeling weak.\n\nMeanwhile, Zametov sat alone, deep in thought. Raskolnikov had flipped a switch in his mind, and he was now sure of one thing: “Ilya Petrovitch is a blockhead.”\n\nAs Raskolnikov opened the restaurant door, he nearly collided with Razumihin on the steps. They didn’t notice each other until they were almost face-to-face. Razumihin was shocked at first, then pure anger sparked in his eyes.\n\n“So, you’re back!” he yelled. “You ditched your bed! I’ve been searching everywhere, even under the sofa! We checked the garret, and I almost lost it with Nastasya looking for you. What’s going on? Spill it!”\n\nRaskolnikov replied coolly, “It means I’m sick of all of you and just want to be alone.”\n\n“Alone? You can barely stand, your face is ghostly white, and you’re gasping for air! Seriously, what were you doing at the Palais de Cristal? Just admit it!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses his desire for solitude despite his deteriorating health, prompting concern and anger from Razumihin."
