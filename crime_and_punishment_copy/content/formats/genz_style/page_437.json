  "text": "Alexandrovna muttered, half in disbelief, like she couldn’t really grasp what just went down. \n\nEveryone felt a wave of relief, and in five minutes, they were laughing. But every now and then, Dounia went pale and frowned, haunted by what had just happened. Pulcheria Alexandrovna was surprised to find she was actually glad—just that morning, she thought breaking things off with Luzhin was a total disaster. Razumihin was pumped. He didn’t fully express his excitement yet, but it felt like a weight had been lifted off his chest. Now, he could dedicate himself to them, to serve them… Anything was possible! But he was also scared to think too far ahead and didn’t let his mind wander. \n\nMeanwhile, Raskolnikov sat there, brooding and indifferent. Even though he’d pushed hard to get rid of Luzhin, he seemed the least bothered by the outcome. Dounia couldn’t shake the feeling that he was still mad at her, and Pulcheria Alexandrovna watched him nervously. \n\n“What did Svidrigaïlov say to you?” Dounia asked, stepping closer. \n\n“Yes, yes!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna chimed in.\n\nRaskolnikov finally looked up. \n\n“He wants to give you ten thousand roubles and wants to see you once, but only in my presence.” \n\n“See her? No way!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna exclaimed. “And how dare he offer her money!” \n\nThen Raskolnikov dryly recounted his chat with Svidrigaïlov, leaving out the ghostly details.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The characters experience a mix of relief and tension following the decision to end Dounia's engagement to Luzhin, revealing their differing emotional responses."
