Where have you been?” \n\nDon’t spoil me, Rodya. Come when you can, but if you can’t, that’s okay. I can wait. Just knowing you care about me is enough. I’ll read your stuff, hear about you from others, and sometimes you’ll visit. What could be better? You’re here now to comfort your mom, and I can see that.\n\nThen Pulcheria Alexandrovna started to cry. \n\n“Here I am again! Don’t mind my tears. Oh my goodness, why am I just sitting here?” she said, jumping up. “I have coffee and didn’t offer you any. That’s just selfishness from getting older. I’ll get it right away!”\n\n“Mother, don’t worry about that. I’m leaving soon. I didn’t come for coffee. Just listen to me.”\n\nPulcheria Alexandrovna approached him cautiously.\n\n“Mother, no matter what happens, no matter what you hear about me, will you always love me like you do now?” he asked, speaking from the heart without really thinking.\n\n“Rodya, what’s going on? Why would you even ask me that? Who would say anything bad about you?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Rodya seeks reassurance from his mother about her unconditional love for him despite any future troubles he may face."
