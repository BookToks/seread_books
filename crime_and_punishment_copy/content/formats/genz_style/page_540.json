  "text": "Sonia knew this would make Katerina Ivanovna feel better and boost her pride. She sat next to Raskolnikov, gave him a quick nod, and glanced at him with curiosity. But after that, she mostly avoided looking or talking to him. She seemed a bit lost in thought but kept her eyes on Katerina Ivanovna, trying to make her happy. Neither Sonia nor Katerina had proper mourning clothes; Sonia wore dark brown, while Katerina had on her only dress, a dark striped cotton one.\n\nThe message from Pyotr Petrovitch hit home. Katerina Ivanovna listened to Sonia with a sense of dignity and asked how Pyotr was doing. Then, she leaned in to Raskolnikov and whispered that it must be odd for someone like Pyotr Petrovitch to be in such “extraordinary company,” despite his loyalty to her family and long friendship with her dad.\n\n“That's why I'm so thankful to you, Rodion Romanovitch, for not turning down my hospitality, even in this situation,” she said, almost a bit louder. “I’m sure it’s your special affection for my late husband that made you keep your promise.”\n\nWith a sense of pride, she looked over her guests and suddenly called out to the deaf man at the table: “Doesn’t he need more meat? And has he had any wine?” The old man didn’t respond and took a while to figure out what she was asking.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia attempts to comfort Katerina Ivanovna while navigating the awkwardness of their situation and the presence of Raskolnikov."
