  "text": "Never, never had he felt so incredibly alone! 😔  \nHe realized he might end up hating Sonia for making her life worse.  \n“Why did I go to her for tears? Why did I have to ruin her life? What a low thing to do!”  \n“I’ll stay alone,” he declared firmly. “She can’t come to prison!”  \n\nJust five minutes later, he lifted his head, a strange smile creeping in.  \n“Maybe Siberia wouldn’t be so bad after all,” he thought.  \n\nHe couldn’t tell how long he sat there, lost in vague thoughts. Suddenly, the door opened, and Dounia walked in. She paused, looking at him from the doorway, just like he had done with Sonia. Then she came in and sat down in the same spot as yesterday, facing him. He stared at her, almost blankly.  \n\n“Don’t be mad, brother; I’m just here for a minute,” Dounia said.  \nHer face was thoughtful but not harsh. Her eyes sparkled with warmth. He could tell she came to him out of love.  \n\n“Brother, I know everything now. Dmitri Prokofitch filled me in on all the details. They’re worrying you over some dumb suspicion. He said there’s no real danger and that you’re overreacting. I get it, and I totally understand why you’re so upset.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels a profound sense of loneliness and guilt for burdening Sonia with his troubles, contemplating isolation as a better alternative."
