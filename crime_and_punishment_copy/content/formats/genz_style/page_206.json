  "text": "‘Whoa, you seem fired up! Hold on a sec. I forgot to ask: what proof do we have that the box belonged to the old lady?’  \n‘That’s been established,’ Razumihin said, looking annoyed. ‘Koch recognized the jewelry box and named the owner, who confirmed it was his.’  \n‘That’s not good. Now, did anyone see Nikolay when Koch and Pestryakov were heading upstairs? Is there any evidence for that?’  \n‘No one saw him,’ Razumihin replied, clearly frustrated. ‘That’s the problem. Even Koch and Pestryakov didn’t notice him on their way up, but honestly, their testimony wouldn’t have been reliable anyway. They just mentioned the flat was open and figured some work was happening, but they didn’t pay attention and can’t remember if there were actually people working.’  \n‘Hmm… So the only defense they have is that they were messing around and laughing. That’s a decent hint, but… What’s your take on all this?’  \n‘What’s there to explain? It’s pretty straightforward. At least the direction for explanation is clear, and the jewelry box points to it. The real killer dropped those earrings. The murderer was upstairs, locked in, when Koch and Pestryakov knocked. Koch, being clueless, didn’t stay at the door, so the murderer sneaked out and ran down. He had no other way to escape. He hid from Koch, Pestryakov, and the porter.’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin discusses the lack of evidence regarding Nikolay's whereabouts during the murder, suggesting that the real murderer escaped unnoticed."
