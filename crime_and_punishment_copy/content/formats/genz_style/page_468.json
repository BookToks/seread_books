Goodbye. \n\nSonia froze in fear. “Wait, do you know who did it?” she asked, horrified and looking at him like he was crazy. \n\n“I know, and I’ll tell you—just you. I picked you for this. I thought about it when your dad talked about you and when Lizaveta was still alive. Goodbye, no handshake. See you tomorrow!” \n\nHe left. Sonia stared at him, feeling like she was losing her mind. Her thoughts were spinning. \n\n“How does he know who killed Lizaveta? What does that even mean? This is terrifying!” But she didn’t let herself think about it. “He must be in so much pain… He left his mom and sister. Why? What happened? What did he say to her? He kissed her foot and said he couldn’t live without her… Oh, my God!” \n\nSonia spent the whole night restless and delirious. She kept jumping up, crying, and wringing her hands, then falling back into a feverish sleep. In her dreams, she saw Polenka, Katerina Ivanovna, and Lizaveta, reading the gospel, and him… with that pale face and burning eyes… kissing her.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia is terrified and confused by Raskolnikov's cryptic knowledge of Lizaveta's murder and his emotional turmoil."
