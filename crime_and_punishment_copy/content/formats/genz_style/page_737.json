No sign of Zametov or Nikodim Fomitch. \n\n“Is anyone here?” Raskolnikov asked the clerk at the desk.\n\n“Who are you looking for?” \n\nSuddenly, a familiar voice chimed in, “At your service!” It was the Explosive Lieutenant, just coming in from another room. Raskolnikov felt a chill. “What a twist of fate,” he thought. “Why is he here?”\n\n“You came to see us? What’s up?” Ilya Petrovitch asked, clearly in a good mood and maybe a bit tipsy. “If it’s business, you’re kinda early. I’m only here by chance, but I’ll help if I can. Wait, what was I saying…?”\n\n“Raskolnikov,” he replied.\n\n“Right, Raskolnikov! I didn’t forget you. I’m not like that. It’s Rodion Ro—Ro—Rodionovitch, right?”\n\n“Rodion Romanovitch.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov encounters the Explosive Lieutenant at the bureau, feeling the weight of fate as he questions the unexpected meeting."
