  "text": "Pulcheria Alexandrovna wrapped up her thoughts, unsure who would hurt the other more—him or her. She then started to ask about the awkward scene with Luzhin from the day before, glancing at Dounia, which clearly annoyed her. This whole situation was really stressing her out. Razumihin recapped the incident but added his own take: he straight-up blamed Raskolnikov for intentionally dissing Pyotr Petrovitch, refusing to excuse him because of his illness. \n\n“He planned it before he got sick,” he said. \n\n“I think so too,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna replied, looking downcast. She was surprised to hear Razumihin speak about Pyotr Petrovitch with such care and even a bit of respect. Dounia noticed it too. \n\n“So, is this how you feel about Pyotr Petrovitch?” Pulcheria couldn’t help but ask. \n\n“I can’t think any differently about your daughter’s future husband,” Razumihin said firmly, with genuine warmth. “I’m not just saying this to be polite; it’s because Avdotya Romanovna chose him herself. If I was rude about him last night, it’s because I was really drunk and… honestly, I was out of my mind. I’m embarrassed about it now.” \n\nHe turned red and stopped talking. Dounia blushed too but stayed quiet. She didn’t say a word.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pulcheria Alexandrovna expresses her concern about the potential misery between her daughter Dounia and her fiancé Pyotr Petrovitch, while Razumihin reflects on Raskolnikov's intentional insult towards him."
