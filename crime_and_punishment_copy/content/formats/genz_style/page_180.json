Listen, Rodya, a lot’s gone down while you’ve been out of it. When you ghosted everyone without a word, I was furious. I decided to track you down and give you a piece of my mind. I started searching right away! I totally blanked on your new place because I didn’t even know it. As for your old spot, I only remembered it was at the Five Corners, Harlamov’s house. But surprise! It wasn’t Harlamov’s; it was Buch’s. Crazy how names can mix you up, right? \n\nSo, I lost my cool and hit up the address bureau the next day. Can you believe it? They found you in two minutes! Your name was right there.\n\n“My name?”\n\n“Of course! But they couldn’t find some General Kobelev while I was there. Anyway, it’s a long story. Once I got to this place, I figured out all your business—everything, brother! Nastasya here can back me up. I met Nikodim Fomitch, Ilya Petrovitch, the house porter, and Mr. Zametov, the head clerk at the police office. And, of course, Pashenka.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin recounts his efforts to find Rodya after he disappeared, revealing that he has learned about all of Rodya's affairs during his search."
