He was waiting for Sonia; he noticed they were parting ways and that she was heading home.\n\n“Home? Where? I’ve seen that face before,” he thought. “I need to find out more.”\n\nAt the corner, he crossed the street, glanced back, and saw Sonia coming his way, completely unaware. She turned the corner, and he followed her from across the street. After about fifty steps, he crossed back over, caught up to her, and kept a couple of yards behind.\n\nHe was around fifty, tall and solid, with broad shoulders that made him look a bit hunched. Dressed in nice, trendy clothes, he looked like a man of means. He carried a fancy cane, tapping it on the pavement with each step; his gloves were spotless. His face was broad and friendly, with high cheekbones and a healthy glow that was rare in Petersburg. His light hair was still thick, with just a few gray strands, and his square beard was even lighter. His blue eyes had a cold, thoughtful vibe, and his lips were bright red. He looked surprisingly youthful for his age.\n\nWhen Sonia reached the canal bank, they were the only two on the pavement. He noticed her lost in thought. As she approached the house where she lived, she turned into the gate, and he followed her in.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A mysterious man observes Sonia as she walks home, intrigued by her demeanor and intent on discovering more about her."
