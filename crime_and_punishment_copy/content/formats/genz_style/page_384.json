Just tell them.”  \n“Say what you want, but I’m coming with you.”  \n“You want to torture me too!” he shouted, filled with irritation and despair. Razumihin’s hands dropped in response. He stood on the steps, watching Raskolnikov march away toward his place. Finally, he clenched his teeth and fists, vowing to confront Porfiry that day, then headed upstairs to calm Pulcheria Alexandrovna, who was anxious about their long absence.\n\nWhen Raskolnikov got home, he was drenched in sweat and breathing hard. He rushed up the stairs, entered his unlocked room, and quickly latched the door. In a panic, he dashed to the corner where he’d hidden his stuff under the paper. He felt around carefully in that hole, checking every crack and fold. Finding nothing, he stood up and exhaled deeply. \n\nAs he was heading to Bakaleyev’s, a thought struck him. What if something—a chain, a stud, or even a scrap of paper with the old woman’s handwriting—had slipped out and was now lost, ready to show up as evidence against him? \n\nHe paused, lost in thought, and a strange, embarrassed smile crept onto his face. He took his time.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, overwhelmed by fear and paranoia, frantically searches for evidence that could incriminate him after a confrontation with Razumihin."
