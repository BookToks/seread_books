  "text": "“Of course you’re right, Sonia,” he finally said, his voice soft. Something had shifted in him. The arrogance and defiance were gone. Now, he sounded weak. “I told you yesterday I wasn’t here to ask for forgiveness, but here I am, asking for it….” He had mentioned Luzhin and Providence for his own sake. He was really asking for forgiveness, Sonia… \n\nHe tried to smile, but it felt half-hearted and empty. He lowered his head, covering his face with his hands. \n\nThen, out of nowhere, a strange wave of bitter hatred for Sonia hit him. Confused and scared by this feeling, he looked up at her. But all he saw were her worried, anxious eyes filled with love. That hatred vanished like a ghost. It wasn’t real; he had mistaken one feeling for another. It was just one of those moments.\n\nHe hid his face again, bowing his head. Suddenly, he turned pale, stood up, glanced at Sonia, and without a word, sat down on her bed like a robot. \n\nWhat he felt in that moment was eerily similar to when he stood over the old woman with the axe and thought he couldn’t waste another second. \n\n“What’s the matter?” Sonia asked, terrified. \n\nHe couldn’t find the words. This wasn’t at all how he planned to “tell” her, and he didn’t understand what was happening to him now. She approached him gently, trying to comfort him.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a profound internal conflict as he seeks forgiveness from Sonia, revealing his vulnerability and confusion."
