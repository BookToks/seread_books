  "text": "Porfiry Petrovitch was going on and on, throwing out random thoughts and laughing at his own jokes. “You thought I was serious about ‘government quarters’? 😂 You’re too ironic! Anyway, let’s not go there! Speaking of formality, you mentioned it earlier during our chat. But honestly, what’s the point of all that? Sometimes a casual convo gets you way more info. Formality is just a fallback, trust me. An examining lawyer can’t stick to rigid rules all the time. Investigating is more of an art than a strict process, you know? He-he!”\n\nHe paused for breath, but kept rambling, tossing around vague phrases and slipping back into nonsense. He was pacing the room, his short legs moving faster and faster. He kept glancing down, right hand behind his back, while his left hand was flailing around, totally out of sync with his words. Raskolnikov noticed Porfiry stopped near the door a couple of times, almost like he was waiting for something.\n\n“Is he expecting someone?” Raskolnikov thought.\n\n“You’re definitely right to poke fun at our legal stuff!” Porfiry said cheerfully, looking at Raskolnikov with this overly simple expression that made him uneasy. “You’re spot on about our legal forms, he-he!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry Petrovitch discusses the ineffectiveness of formalities in legal investigations while engaging Raskolnikov in seemingly trivial conversation."
