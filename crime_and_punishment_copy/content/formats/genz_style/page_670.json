  "text": "“Do you know I’m getting married?” \n\n“You mentioned it before.”\n\n“Did I? Can’t remember. But I hadn’t even met my fiancée then. I was just thinking about it. Now it’s official! If I didn’t have urgent stuff to handle, I’d take you to meet her right now. I’d love your advice. Ugh, only ten minutes left! Look at the time. But my marriage story is interesting. Where are you headed? Leaving again?”\n\n“Nope, not going anywhere.”\n\n“Really? We’ll see. I’ll take you to meet my fiancée, just not now. You have to go right, and I’ll go left. You know Madame Resslich, the woman I’m staying with? I know what you’re thinking—she’s the one whose daughter drowned last winter. Listen up! She set this whole thing up for me. She said I was bored and needed something to do. \n\nYou know I’m a pretty gloomy person, right? I’m not exactly cheerful. I can sit in silence for days. And that Resslich? She’s crafty. I know what she’s planning. She thinks I’ll get tired of my wife, leave her, and then Resslich will swoop in and profit off my fiancée—someone from our class or higher. She told me my fiancée’s dad is a washed-up retired official who just sits around all day.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The speaker reveals their engagement and expresses a desire to share the story of their marriage while discussing their gloomy disposition and the intentions of their landlady."
