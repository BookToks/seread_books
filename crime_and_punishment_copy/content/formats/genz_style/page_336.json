  "text": "**Crime and Punishment**  \n**Chapter IV**  \n\nJust then, the door creaked open, and a young girl stepped inside, glancing around nervously. Everyone turned to look at her, surprised and curious. At first, Raskolnikov didn’t recognize her. It was Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov. He had only seen her yesterday, but now, in this setting and outfit, she looked completely different. \n\nShe was dressed simply and poorly, almost childlike, with a modest and refined vibe. Her face was open but a bit scared. She wore a plain indoor dress and an old hat, yet she still held a parasol. Finding the room packed with people, she felt more overwhelmed than embarrassed, like a shy little kid. She almost turned to leave. \n\n“Oh… it’s you!” Raskolnikov said, taken aback, his own confusion evident. He suddenly remembered that his mom and sister had heard from Luzhin’s letter about “some young woman of notorious behavior.” He had just been defending her against Luzhin’s nasty claims, insisting he’d only met her last night, and now here she was. He also recalled that he hadn’t challenged the term “notorious behavior.” All these thoughts raced through his mind, but they felt hazy and fleeting.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov enters the room, surprising Raskolnikov and evoking his confusion about her reputation."
