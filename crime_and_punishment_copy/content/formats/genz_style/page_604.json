There are good people who help a struggling lady). These orphans are from a good family—maybe even aristocrats—and that awful general was just sitting there eating his fancy meal… and got mad at me for bothering him. ‘Your excellency,’ I said, ‘please help the orphans; you knew my late husband, Semyon Zaharovitch, and on the day he died, a total jerk slandered his only daughter.’ … And now that cop is back!
