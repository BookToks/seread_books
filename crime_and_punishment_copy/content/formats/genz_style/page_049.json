  "text": "Hey Rodya, I’ve got some news for you. First off, your sister has been living with me for the past six weeks, and we’re sticking together from now on. 🙌 Thank goodness her tough times are over! But let me break it down for you step by step so you get the full story and what we’ve kept from you.\n\nWhen you wrote to me two months ago about Dounia struggling at the Svidrigraïlovs’ place, I couldn’t tell you everything. If I had spilled all the details, I know you would have dropped everything to come help her, even if it meant walking here. I get how you feel, and I know you wouldn’t let her be disrespected.\n\nI was in a tough spot too, but I didn’t know the full story back then. The situation was complicated because Dounia got paid 100 roubles in advance when she became their governess. The catch? They deducted part of her salary every month, so she couldn’t just quit without paying back the debt. \n\nHere’s the thing: she took that money mainly to send you 60 roubles when you needed it badly last year. We lied a bit, saying it was from Dounia’s savings, but that wasn’t true. I’m telling you all this now because things have finally turned around for the better. I want you to see how much Dounia cares about you and the big heart she has. ❤️\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia has been living with the narrator for six weeks, and her sufferings are over, revealing her deep love for Rodya."
