  "text": "Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com. Dostoevsky was sentenced to death by a “stern and just man” (as Maurice Baring puts it). After eight months in prison, he and twenty-one others were taken to Semyonovsky Square to be executed. He wrote to his brother Mihail: “They spoke over us, and we had to wear white shirts like those condemned to die. We were tied to stakes, and I thought I had only minutes left. I thought of you and your loved ones, kissed Plestcheiev and Dourov next to me, and said goodbye. Suddenly, the troops played a drumroll, we were untied, brought back, and told that the king had spared our lives.” Instead of death, he got hard labor.\n\nOne prisoner, Grigoryev, lost his mind as soon as he was freed and never recovered. This intense suffering marked Dostoevsky forever. His faith helped him accept his pain, seeing it as a blessing in the end. But he often wrote about the agony of those condemned to die, highlighting the cruelty of such punishment. He then spent four years in Siberia with common criminals, where he started writing “Dead House,” followed by some time in a disciplinary battalion. Before his arrest, he showed signs of a strange nervous disease, which turned into violent attacks now.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dostoevsky's near-execution and subsequent imprisonment profoundly influenced his writing and views on suffering and cruelty."
