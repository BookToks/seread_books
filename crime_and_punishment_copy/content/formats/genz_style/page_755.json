  "text": "Sonia kept visiting, even when he was grumpy and rude. Eventually, those visits became a must for him. He felt genuinely upset when she got sick and couldnâ€™t come. She would catch him on holidays at the prison gates or in the guard-room for a quick chat. On regular days, sheâ€™d see him while he was working at the workshops, brick kilns, or sheds by the Irtish River.\n\nSonia mentioned she was making friends in town and doing some sewing. Since there werenâ€™t many dressmakers around, she was basically a go-to person for a lot of households. But she didnâ€™t say that the authorities were keeping an eye on Raskolnikov because of her, or that his workload had gotten lighter.\n\nThen, the news hit (Dounia had sensed something was off in earlier letters): Raskolnikov was isolating himself. His fellow inmates didnâ€™t vibe with him, he was silent for days, and he looked really pale. In her last letter, Sonia said he got seriously ill and was now in the hospital's convict ward. ðŸ˜Ÿ\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's isolation and declining health in prison distress Sonia, who remains devoted to him despite her own struggles."
