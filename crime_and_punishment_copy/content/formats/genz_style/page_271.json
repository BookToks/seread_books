First, it’s the ‘Ave Maria,’ then another one: ‘Lord, forgive and bless sister Sonia,’ and one more for our second dad. Our real dad is gone, but we pray for him too.”\n\n“Polenka, I’m Rodion. Please pray for me sometimes—just say, ‘And Thy servant Rodion.’ Nothing more.”\n\n“I’ll pray for you forever!” she said, suddenly beaming as she rushed over to hug him again.\n\nRaskolnikov told her his name and address, promising to visit the next day. The little girl left, totally enchanted by him. It was past ten when he stepped outside. In five minutes, he was back on the bridge where the woman had jumped.\n\n“Enough!” he declared, feeling triumphant. “I’m done with fantasies and fears! Life is real! Haven’t I just lived? My life didn’t end with that old woman! She’s in the Kingdom of Heaven—now leave me alone! It’s time for reason, light, will, and strength. Let’s see what I’m made of!” he said defiantly, as if challenging some dark force. “Right now, I feel weak, but I think my illness is over. I knew it would be once I stepped outside.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov resolves to embrace life and strength after a meaningful encounter with a young girl."
