I will get in! You thought she’d just accept this? You miscalculated! I’m not backing down! You’ve crossed the line. Search her! Search her!”\n\nKaterina Ivanovna, in a rage, shook Luzhin and dragged him toward Sonia. \n\n“I’ll take responsibility… but chill out, madam. I see you’re not as meek as you seem! Well, about that…,” Luzhin stammered, “it should probably be handled by the police… though there are plenty of witnesses already. I’m willing… but it’s tricky for a man… because of her being a woman… With Amalia Ivanovna’s help… but this isn’t really the right way to go about it… How do we even do this?”\n\n“Do whatever you want! Anyone can search her!” Katerina Ivanovna shouted. “Sonia, empty your pockets! Look! See, monster? The pocket’s empty—here’s her handkerchief! And the other pocket—look! Do you see it?”\n\nKaterina Ivanovna turned—actually yanked—both pockets inside out. Suddenly, a piece of paper flew out from the right pocket, soaring through the air and landing at Luzhin’s feet. Everyone noticed it, and several gasped. Pyotr Petrovitch bent down, picked up the paper with two fingers, raised it for everyone to see, and opened it. It was a hundred-rouble note folded into eighths.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna confronts Luzhin, accusing him of wrongdoing and demanding that Sonia's innocence be proven by searching her pockets."
