  "text": "Sonia was getting more and more anxious. She could tell dinner was about to get awkward, especially with Katerina Ivanovna getting more irritated by the minute. Sonia knew she was the main reason the ‘genteel’ ladies were looking down on Katerina’s invitation. Amalia Ivanovna had made it clear that she was offended, questioning how Katerina could let her daughter sit next to someone like Sonia. \n\nSonia felt that Katerina had probably heard those snide comments, and an insult aimed at Sonia hit Katerina harder than anything directed at herself or her family. Katerina wouldn’t rest until she showed those rude ladies what was what. \n\nTo make things worse, someone passed Sonia a plate with two hearts pierced by an arrow, made from black bread. Katerina turned bright red and shouted across the table that the guy who sent it was “a drunken fool!” \n\nAmalia, sensing the tension and feeling hurt by Katerina’s arrogance, tried to lighten the mood. Out of nowhere, she started telling a story about her acquaintance, Karl from the chemist’s. She said he once got into a cab where the driver wanted to kill him, and Karl begged him not to, crying and clasping his hands in fear. \n\nEven though Katerina smiled, she quickly pointed out that Amalia really shouldn’t be telling stories in Russian.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia feels anxious about Katerina Ivanovna's growing irritation at the dinner, aware that her presence is the source of contempt from the other guests."
