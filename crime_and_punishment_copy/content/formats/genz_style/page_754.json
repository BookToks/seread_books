  "text": "Raskolnikov was always moody and barely talked. He didn’t seem to care much about the news from their letters. When Sonia finally told him his mother had died, he didn’t react much at all, at least not on the outside. \n\nShe noticed that even though he seemed lost in his own world, he had a clear view of his new life. He knew where he stood and didn’t expect anything better anytime soon. He wasn’t caught up in unrealistic hopes like many others in his situation. He took everything around him in stride, even though it was nothing like what he was used to.\n\nSonia mentioned that his health was okay. He worked hard without slacking off and didn’t care much about food. The meals were terrible, especially on regular days, so he eventually accepted some cash from her to buy his own tea. He asked her not to worry about him, saying all the fuss just annoyed him.\n\nShe also wrote that he shared a cramped room with other inmates. She hadn’t seen their barracks, but she figured they were awful and unhealthy. He slept on a plank bed with just a rug for comfort and didn’t want to change anything about it. His rough living wasn’t a choice; he just didn’t pay attention to it. \n\nAt first, he didn’t care about her visits and was even a bit annoyed with her for coming.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's indifference to his mother's death reflects his deep internal struggles and detachment from his surroundings."
