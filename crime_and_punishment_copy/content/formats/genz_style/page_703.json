  "text": "Svidrigaïlov was definitely trying to show he wasn’t scared of anyone. But they needed to keep things quiet—who knows what could happen? The money had to be locked up, and luckily, Fedosya, the cook, was still in the kitchen. And for sure, no one should mention anything to that old lady, Madame Resslich. They whispered until 2 AM, but the girl went to bed earlier, feeling confused and a bit sad. \n\nAt midnight, Svidrigaïlov crossed the bridge back to the mainland. The rain had stopped, but the wind was wild. He shivered and stared at the dark waters of the Little Neva, intrigued for a moment. But it was freezing by the water, so he headed toward Y. Prospect. He walked down that long street for about half an hour, stumbling on the wooden pavement, but always searching for something on the right side. He remembered there was a hotel at the end, something like Adrianople. \n\nHe wasn’t wrong; the hotel stood out in that desolate area, even in the dark. It was a long, weathered wooden building, and despite the late hour, lights flickered in the windows, hinting at life inside. He walked in and asked a scruffy guy in the hallway for a room. The guy sized him up and straightened himself out.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov, after a secretive meeting, walks through the rain to find a hotel, contemplating his surroundings and feeling cold."
