Plus, it’s late—oh wow, it’s past ten!’ she exclaimed, glancing at her fancy gold watch hanging on a thin chain. (A gift from her fiancé, Razumihin thought.)\n\n‘We need to go, Dounia! We need to go!’ her mom said, flustered. ‘He’ll think we’re still mad about yesterday since we’re showing up so late. Good heavens!’\n\nAs she spoke, she hurriedly put on her hat and coat. Dounia did the same. Razumihin noticed her gloves were not just worn out but had holes in them. Still, their obvious struggle gave the two women a unique dignity—like they owned their situation. He admired Dounia and felt proud to be with her. (The queen who mended her stockings in prison probably looked even more regal than at fancy parties.)\n\n‘My God!’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna exclaimed. ‘I never thought I’d be scared to see my son, my sweet Rodya! I’m worried, Dmitri Prokofitch,’ she added, glancing at him nervously.\n\n‘Don’t worry, Mom,’ Dounia said, giving her a kiss. ‘Just believe in him.’\n\n‘Oh, I believe in him, but I didn’t sleep at all last night,’ the poor woman admitted.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Dounia are anxious about visiting Rodya, fearing his reaction and their strained relationship."
