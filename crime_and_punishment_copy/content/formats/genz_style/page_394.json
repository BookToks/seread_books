  "text": "Raskolnikov felt his heart racing as he lay there, frozen. Below, people were gathered, heads all together, silent and waiting. He tried to scream but jolted awake instead.\n\nTaking a deep breath, he realized the dream lingered. His door swung open, and a stranger stepped in, staring at him. Raskolnikov barely opened his eyes, then shut them tight again, lying still on his back.\n\n“Is this still a dream?” he thought, peeking again. The stranger was still there, watching him.\n\nThe man entered the room quietly, closing the door behind him. He walked over to the table, paused, and then sat down on a chair by the sofa, keeping his eyes locked on Raskolnikov. He placed his hat on the floor and rested his chin on his hands, clearly ready to wait as long as needed. From what Raskolnikov could see, the guy was no spring chicken—he was stout, with a full, light-colored beard.\n\nTen minutes ticked by. It was still light out, but dusk was creeping in. The room was dead silent. No sounds from the stairs, just a big fly buzzing against the window. It was too much. Raskolnikov finally got up and sat on the sofa.\n\n“Alright, just tell me what you want,” he said. \n\n“I knew you weren’t really asleep, just pretending,” the stranger replied.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is startled awake by a stranger who quietly enters his room and waits for him to acknowledge him."
