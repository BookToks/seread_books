  "text": "For someone she loves, someone she adores, she’s ready to sell herself! That’s the reality. For her brother, for her mom, she’ll give up everything! In situations like this, we toss aside our morals if we have to—freedom, peace, conscience, all of it goes on the chopping block. “Let my life go, as long as my loved ones are happy!” \n\nWe even become skilled at justifying it. We convince ourselves it’s our duty for a good cause. That’s just how we roll, and it’s obvious. Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov is at the center of all this, no one else. She thinks she can make him happy, keep him in school, help him secure a future. He could end up rich, respected, maybe even famous! But what about my mom? It’s all about Rodya, her firstborn! For a son like that, who wouldn’t sacrifice their daughter? \n\nOh, those loving, biased hearts! For him, we wouldn’t even flinch at Sonia’s fate. Sonia Marmeladov, the eternal victim as long as the world exists. Have you really thought about your sacrifice, both of you? Is it right? Can you handle it? Is it even worth it? \n\nLet me tell you, Dounia, Sonia’s life isn’t worse than life with Mr. Luzhin. “There can be no question of love,” Mom writes. But what if there’s no respect either? What if there’s disgust, contempt, even hatred? Then what? You’ll have to keep up appearances, right? Do you get what that smartness means? The Luzhin smartness is just the same.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia is willing to sacrifice herself for her family's happiness, questioning the morality and consequences of such sacrifices."
