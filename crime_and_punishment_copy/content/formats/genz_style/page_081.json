Even if he gets me lessons or shares his last few coins (if he has any), what’s that gonna do? I need boots to look decent enough to teach… but then what? Earning a few coins isn’t my goal right now.

After a long moment, an unexpected idea popped into his head. \n\n“Okay… I’ll go to Razumihin,” he said suddenly, sounding calm as if he had made a solid choice. “But not now. I’ll go the day after It happens, once everything is over and I can start fresh…”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov contemplates visiting Razumihin for help but doubts its effectiveness, deciding instead to wait until after a significant event he refers to as \"It.\""
