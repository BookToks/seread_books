  "text": "A heavy horse-drawn cart rolled by, and the driver yelled, “Hey there, German hatter!” He pointed right at the young man. The guy froze, clutching his hat nervously. It was a tall, round hat from Zimmerman’s, but it was totally wrecked—old, torn, and bent in a way that made it look ridiculous. Instead of feeling shame, he was hit by a wave of panic.\n\n“I knew it,” he mumbled, feeling flustered. “This is the worst! A dumb detail like this could ruin everything. My hat stands out too much. It’s absurd, and that makes it noticeable. I should be wearing a cap or something old and plain, not this weird thing. No one wears a hat like this; it would be remembered. And that’s a problem. For what I’m planning, I need to blend in. Being conspicuous is the last thing I want. Little things like this can mess everything up…”\n\nHe didn’t have far to go; he knew exactly how many steps it took from his place: seven hundred thirty. He had counted them once while daydreaming. Back then, he didn’t take those dreams seriously; they felt reckless and terrifying. But now, a month later, he viewed them differently. Despite mocking his own hesitation, he found himself seeing this “terrible” dream as something he might actually try.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The young man is consumed by anxiety over his conspicuous hat, fearing it could jeopardize his carefully planned actions."
