  "text": "A weird time started for Raskolnikov. It felt like a fog had settled over him, trapping him in a lonely, gloomy place with no way out. Later on, he thought his mind had been foggy during that time, and it stayed that way, on and off, until everything hit the fan. He realized he had messed up a lotâ€”like getting dates wrong and mixing up events. When he tried to piece his memories together, he learned a lot about himself from what others said. He had confused incidents and blamed things on stuff that only existed in his head. \n\nSometimes, he felt intense anxiety that felt almost like panic. But he also had momentsâ€”hours, maybe even daysâ€”where he felt completely numb, like a reaction to all the fear he had been through. In those moments, it was like he was trying to avoid fully grasping his situation. Certain important truths he needed to face were super annoying to him. He wished he could just let go of some worries, but ignoring them could lead to total disaster. \n\nOne big worry was SvidrigaÃ¯lov. ðŸ˜Ÿ\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a disorienting period of solitude and mental turmoil, struggling to reconcile his thoughts and fears amidst impending catastrophe."
