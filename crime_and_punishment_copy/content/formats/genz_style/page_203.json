  "text": "I stepped on the box. It was wrapped in paper. I peeled it off and found some little hooks. Inside were the earrings… \n\n“Behind the door? Lying behind the door?” Raskolnikov suddenly shouted, staring at Razumihin with a look of pure terror. He slowly sat up on the sofa, propped up on his hand.\n\n“Yeah... why? What’s up? What’s wrong?” Razumihin also got up.\n\n“Nothing,” Raskolnikov replied weakly, turning to face the wall. A heavy silence fell.\n\n“He must’ve just woken from a dream,” Razumihin finally said, glancing at Zossimov, who shook his head slightly.\n\n“Okay, go on,” Zossimov urged. “What happened next?”\n\n“As soon as he saw the earrings, he forgot about Dmitri and everything else. He grabbed his cap and ran to Dushkin, got a rouble from him. He lied, claiming he found them in the street, then went off to drink. He keeps saying his old story about the murder: ‘I know nothing about it, never heard of it until the day before yesterday.’ When they asked why he didn’t go to the police sooner, he said, ‘I was scared.’ And when they asked why he tried to hang himself, he said, ‘From anxiety.’ ‘What anxiety?’ they asked. ‘That I might be accused.’ That’s the whole story. So what do you think they figured out from that?”\n\n“Well, there’s no guessing. It’s a clue, even if it’s weak. You wouldn’t let your painter go free, right?”\n\n“Now they’ve just assumed he’s the murderer.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's anxiety and guilt manifest as he grapples with the implications of the ear-rings found in connection to a murder."
