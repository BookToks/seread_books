  "text": "I need to remind you of something important. Remember when you thanked me and even cried a bit? I’m bringing this up to jog your memory and to show you I remember every detail. I gave you a ten-rouble note as the first part of my help for your relative. Mr. Lebeziatnikov saw it all go down. \n\nAfter that, I walked you to the door while you were still feeling awkward. Once you left, I chatted with Mr. Lebeziatnikov for about ten minutes. When he left, I went back to the table to count the money and set it aside like I planned. But to my shock, a hundred-rouble note was missing. \n\nThink about this: I can’t suspect Mr. Lebeziatnikov— that’s just embarrassing to even consider. I double-checked my math right before you came in, and everything was correct. Given how flustered you were, how eager you were to leave, and the way your hands were on the table, I was forced to think the worst— a terrible but understandable suspicion! \n\nI know I’m taking a risk by accusing you, but I had to say something. I couldn’t just ignore it.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Luzhin accuses Sonia of stealing a hundred-rouble note, expressing his suspicion despite his reluctance to do so."
