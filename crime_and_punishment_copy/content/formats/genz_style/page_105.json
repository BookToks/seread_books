He secured them tightly with thread, wrapping everything in clean white paper and tying it up snugly. This was to distract the old woman while she struggled to untie it, buying him some time. The iron was there to give it weight, so she wouldn’t suspect it was just wood at first. He had stashed this under the sofa earlier.\n\nJust as he got the bundle out, he heard someone moving around outside. \n\n“It’s way past six!” \n\nPanic set in. He dashed to the door, listened intently, grabbed his hat, and crept down the thirteen steps like a cat. He still needed to grab the axe from the kitchen. He’d decided long ago that he needed an axe for what he planned. He had a pocket knife too, but he didn’t trust it—or himself—so he settled on the axe. \n\nOne odd thing about all his decisions: the more certain he felt, the more twisted and absurd they seemed to him. Despite his intense inner conflict, he never managed to shake that feeling.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist meticulously prepares a concealed weapon to execute his plan, reflecting his inner turmoil and the absurdity of his resolve."
