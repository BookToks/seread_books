  "text": "The cop looked confused, staring at Raskolnikov like he was nuts. Raskolnikov just laughed. \n\n“Whatever,” said the cop, rolling his eyes, and he went after the dandy and the girl, probably thinking Raskolnikov was a madman or something worse.\n\n“Great, he took my twenty copecks,” Raskolnikov grumbled when he was alone. “Let him take more from that guy to keep the girl. Why did I even get involved? Do I have the right to help? Let them tear each other apart—what’s it to me? Why did I give him twenty copecks? Were they even mine?”\n\nDespite those weird thoughts, he felt miserable. He plopped down on an empty bench, his mind wandering aimlessly. He just wanted to forget everything and wake up to a fresh start.\n\n“Poor girl,” he said, glancing at the spot where she had been. “She’ll come to her senses and cry. Then her mom will find out… and give her a brutal beating. Maybe even kick her out. And if not, the gossip will spread, and soon she’ll be sneaking around. Then it’s straight to the hospital (that’s always the fate for girls with respectable moms who mess up secretly), and then… more hospital visits, drinking, taverns… and back to the hospital.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reflects on the tragic fate of a girl he feels powerless to help, contemplating the cycle of despair that ensnares her."
