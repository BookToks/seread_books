Zosimov was worried he might go mad earlier, so we shouldn’t stress him out. \n\n“What do you mean?” the mother asked, surprised.  \n“Did the doctor really say that?” Avdotya Romanovna asked, looking worried.  \n\n“Yeah, but it’s not true at all. He gave him some medicine—a powder, I saw it. And then you showed up… Honestly, it would’ve been better if you came tomorrow. Good thing we left. In an hour, Zosimov will update you on everything.
