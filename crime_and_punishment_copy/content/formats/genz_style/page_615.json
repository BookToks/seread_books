  "text": "Svidrigaïlov was working on getting the three orphans into good homes. He mentioned that the money he’d set aside for them made a big difference. It’s easier to place orphans with some cash than those with nothing. He also talked about Sonia and promised to swing by in a day or two to chat with Raskolnikov about some important stuff.\n\nThis chat happened in the stairwell. Svidrigaïlov stared at Raskolnikov and then, lowering his voice, said, “Hey, Rodion Romanovitch, you don’t look like yourself. You’re here, but you seem out of it. Don’t worry! We’ll figure things out. I just have a lot on my plate, with my own stuff and other people’s too. But remember, what everyone really needs is fresh air—more than anything!” 🌬️\n\nHe stepped aside for the priest and server who were heading up for the requiem service. Svidrigaïlov had them sing it twice a day without fail. After he left, Raskolnikov paused for a moment, thought it over, and followed the priest into Sonia’s room. He stood at the door as they began to sing the service slowly and sadly. Death had always felt heavy and mysterious to him, and it had been a while since he’d heard this service. There was something else too, something dark and unsettling. He looked at the kids; they were all kneeling by the coffin. 😔\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov discusses the placement of orphans and expresses concern for Raskolnikov's well-being while preparing for a requiem service."
