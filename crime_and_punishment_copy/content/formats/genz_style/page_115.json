  "text": "“Hey, Alyona Ivanovna, it’s me… Raskolnikov. I brought the pledge I promised.” He showed her the item.\n\nThe old woman took a quick look at it before locking her gaze on him. Her eyes were sharp, full of suspicion. He felt like she was reading him, maybe even mocking him. A minute went by, and he started to panic. If she kept staring without saying anything, he thought he might just bolt.\n\n“Why are you looking at me like you don’t know me?” he snapped back, feeling a bit of malice himself. “Take it or leave it; I’m in a rush.”\n\nHe didn’t plan to say that, but it just came out. The old woman snapped back to reality, and his assertive tone seemed to boost her confidence.\n\n“Well, what is it?” she asked, eyeing the pledge.\n\n“It’s the silver cigarette case I mentioned last time.”\n\nShe reached out for it.\n\n“But you look so pale… and your hands are shaking. Have you been swimming or something?” \n\n“Fever,” he replied curtly. “You get pale when you don’t eat,” he added, struggling to get the words out. \n\nHe could feel his strength slipping again.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov visits Alyona Ivanovna to present a pledge but feels increasingly anxious and mistrusted during the encounter."
