That caught my attention because I thought you were trying to help her without me noticing. I watched closely and saw you slip it into her pocket. I swear, I saw it happen.\n\nLebeziatnikov was almost out of breath. Everyone around him reacted, mostly in shock, but some looked ready to confront Pyotr Petrovitch. Katerina Ivanovna rushed to Lebeziatnikov.\n\n“I was wrong about you! Help her! You’re her only hope! She’s an orphan. God sent you!” \n\nKaterina Ivanovna, not fully aware of what she was doing, dropped to her knees in front of him.\n\n“Total nonsense!” Luzhin shouted, furious. “What you’re saying is ridiculous! You think I gave it to her secretly on purpose? Why would I do that? What does this even matter?”\n\n“Why? I don’t get it either, but I know what I saw! You, a criminal, made me wonder right when I was thanking you and shaking your hand. Why did you hide it in her pocket? Why the secrecy?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Lebeziatnikov witnesses Luzhin secretly giving a hundred-rouble note to Sofya, prompting a confrontation about his intentions."
