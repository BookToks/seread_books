The weight on his shoulders was brutal. Sometimes he felt totally drained. Ever since the scene with Nikolay at Porfiry’s place, he’d felt trapped, like there was no way out. After Nikolay’s confession, that same day he had the encounter with Sonia. The way he acted and what he said were nothing like what he’d expected. He felt weaker, like he was crumbling! Deep down, he knew he couldn’t keep living with that guilt hanging over him. \n\nAnd then there was Svidrigaïlov—he was a puzzle. Sure, he stressed him out, but not in the same way. There might still be a showdown with Svidrigaïlov. He could even be a way out too, but Porfiry? That was a whole different story. \n\nSo, Porfiry had laid it all out for Razumihin, diving into his annoying psychology stuff again. Seriously? How could Porfiry think Nikolay was guilty after everything that had happened before Nikolay showed up? That one-on-one chat had a clear meaning. (Raskolnikov kept replaying that convo with Porfiry in his head; he couldn’t shake it off.) The words and gestures they exchanged had been loaded.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels a renewed sense of struggle and the burden of his guilt becomes increasingly unbearable after recent encounters."
