Seriously, I’m your friend here—your best friend right now—so consider what you’re doing, or I won’t back down. What do you say?”\n\n“I didn’t take anything,” Sonia whispered, scared. “You gave me ten roubles, here it is, take it.” \n\nShe pulled out her handkerchief, untied a corner, and handed the ten-rouble note to Luzhin. \n\n“And what about the hundred roubles you’re not admitting to?” he pressed, looking at her with judgment.\n\nSonia glanced around. Everyone was staring at her with harsh, mocking, and unfriendly looks. She met Raskolnikov’s gaze; he was leaning against the wall, arms crossed, eyes burning with intensity. \n\n“Oh my God!” Sonia gasped.\n\n“Amalia Ivanovna, we might need to call the police, so please, can you send for the house porter?” Luzhin said, his tone almost nice.\n\n“Oh my goodness! I knew she was a thief!” Amalia Ivanovna exclaimed, throwing her hands up.\n\n“You knew that?” Luzhin jumped in. “So, you had some reason to think that before? I kindly ask you, Amalia Ivanovna, to remember your words in front of witnesses.” \n\nA buzz of chatter erupted around them.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia is accused of theft by Luzhin, leading to a tense confrontation where she desperately denies the accusation."
