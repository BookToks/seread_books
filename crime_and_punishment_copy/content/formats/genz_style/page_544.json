  "text": "Katerina Ivanovna was really offended and shot back that her “Vater aus Berlin” was a big deal and always had his hands in his pockets. This made her laugh so hard that Amalia Ivanovna almost lost it. \n\n“Listen to her!” Katerina whispered, her mood lifting. “She meant to say he keeps his hands in his pockets, but instead, she said he puts his hands in people’s pockets.” (Cough-cough.) “And have you noticed, Rodion, that all these foreigners in Petersburg, especially the Germans, are so much dumber than us? Can you imagine any of us saying that ‘Karl from the chemist’s’ ‘pierced his heart from fear’ and then the idiot just ‘clasped his hands and wept, and much begged’? What a fool! She thinks it’s so touching and has no clue how ridiculous she sounds! Honestly, that drunk clerk is way smarter; at least you can tell he’s messed up from drinking. But these foreigners? Always so stiff and serious… Look at her glaring! She’s mad, ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.)”\n\nFeeling better, Katerina Ivanovna jumped right into telling Raskolnikov about her plans. Once she got her pension, she wanted to open a school for the daughters of gentlemen back in her hometown, T——. This was the first time she mentioned it to him, and she got really into the details. Turns out, she even had the certificate of honor that Marmeladov had told Raskolnikov about.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna, regaining her good humor, shares her dream of opening a school for the daughters of gentlemen while mocking the behavior of foreigners."
