  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nSo, one guy was missing—turns out he hadn’t been himself for a couple of days. The party had a mix of characters: there was a Polish dude, a sketchy clerk with a spotty face and a greasy coat who didn’t say a word and smelled terrible. Then there was an old man, almost deaf and blind, who used to work at the post office and had been supported by Amalia Ivanovna forever.\n\nA retired clerk from the commissariat showed up too—totally drunk, laughing way too loud, and get this—he wasn’t even wearing a waistcoat! One guest just plopped down at the table without even saying hi to Katerina Ivanovna. And then there was this guy in a dressing gown who was such a mess that Amalia Ivanovna and the Polish guy had to kick him out. But the Pole brought along two other Poles who weren’t even supposed to be there, which really ticked Katerina Ivanovna off. “What was the point of all this preparation?” she thought. \n\nThe kids weren’t even at the table; they were stuck on a bench in the corner with their dinner on a box. Poor Polenka, being the oldest, had to take care of them, making sure they ate and stayed clean like good kids should. \n\nKaterina Ivanovna couldn’t help but meet her guests with a bit more dignity and even a touch of haughtiness. She shot some of them serious looks and invited them to sit down like she was royalty.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna feels frustrated and disrespected by the unrefined guests at her gathering, highlighting her struggle to maintain dignity amidst chaos."
