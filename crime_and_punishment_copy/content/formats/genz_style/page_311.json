  "text": "I couldn’t meet you at the station, but I sent someone reliable to do it. I also won’t be able to see you tomorrow morning because of urgent Senate business. Plus, I don’t want to crash your family reunion while you’re with your son, and Avdotya Romanovna is with her brother. I plan to visit you at your place tomorrow evening at 8 PM sharp.\n\nHowever, I must insist that Rodion Romanovitch isn’t there during our meeting. He disrespected me during my last visit when he was sick, and I need a clear explanation from you on a specific matter. If Rodion shows up despite my request, I’ll have to leave immediately, and that’ll be on you.\n\nI’m writing this under the assumption that Rodion, who seemed really sick when I visited, suddenly got better and can come see you too. I saw him just a couple of hours later, and it was confirmed by a drunken man who was hit by a car and has since passed away. He gave 25 roubles to a young woman known for her bad behavior under the guise of helping with the funeral, which surprised me given how hard you worked to raise that money.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Luzhin requests that Rodion Romanovitch not be present at their upcoming meeting due to a previous affront."
