  "text": "Raskolnikov’s friend was excited to show off his finds. “Check this out!” he said, pulling out a decent cap. “Let me try it on.” Raskolnikov brushed it off, annoyed. \n\n“Come on, Rodya! Don’t be like that. If you wait, it’ll be too late. I can’t sleep until I get you sorted out.” \n\nNext, he revealed a pair of light, gray summer trousers. “Look at these! No holes, no stains—super respectable, even if they’re a little worn. Plus, I’ve got a matching waistcoat. The wear actually makes them better—softer and smoother.” \n\nHe continued, “To get ahead in life, you’ve got to stick with the seasons. If you don’t buy asparagus in January, you save cash. Same with these clothes. It’s summer, so I got summer stuff. Come fall, you’ll need warmer clothes anyway. These won’t last, especially if you want something fancier later.” \n\nHe grinned. “What do you think? Two roubles twenty-five copecks! And here’s the kicker: if you wear these out, you get another pair for free! That’s how they do it at Fedyaev’s. Buy once, and you’re set for life—trust me, you won’t want to go back.” \n\nThen he showed off the boots. “Yeah, they’re a bit worn, but they’ll last a couple of months. They’re foreign-made leather! The secretary of the English Embassy sold them last week—only wore them six days because he needed cash. Price? A rouble and a half. Total steal, right?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The conversation revolves around the purchase of second-hand clothing, emphasizing the practicality and cost-effectiveness of buying worn items."
