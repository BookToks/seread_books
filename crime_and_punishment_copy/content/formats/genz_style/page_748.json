  "text": "Raskolnikov was at university when he helped a sick classmate. He spent his last cash to support him for six months. When the classmate died, he took care of his elderly dad, who had been struggling since the kid was thirteen. Raskolnikov got the old man into a hospital and even paid for his funeral when he passed away.\n\nHis landlady backed him up, saying that back when they lived at Five Corners, Raskolnikov saved two kids from a burning building and got burned himself in the process. This was confirmed by several witnesses. All of this made people see him in a better light.\n\nIn the end, considering these circumstances, he was sentenced to eight years of penal servitude in the second class (a lighter punishment).\n\nAt the start of the trial, Raskolnikov’s mom got sick. Dounia and Razumihin managed to get her out of Petersburg during the proceedings. Razumihin picked a town close to Petersburg so he could keep tabs on the trial and see Dounia as much as possible. Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s illness was odd—it messed with her nerves and her mind.\n\nWhen Dounia came back from her last visit with Raskolnikov, she found her mom already sick and in a feverish daze. That evening, Razumihin and Dounia figured out how to answer her questions about Raskolnikov and created a story about him needing to go far away in Russia.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's past acts of kindness and extenuating circumstances lead to a lighter sentence of eight years in penal servitude despite his crimes."
