  "text": "“What do you mean? Understand… what?” Zametov asked, clearly confused. \n\nRaskolnikov’s serious face shifted dramatically. He burst into that same nervous laugh again, like he couldn’t help himself. In a flash, he vividly recalled a recent moment: standing with an axe behind the door, while the latch shook and the guys outside swore and rattled it. He felt a wild urge to shout at them, to curse, to stick out his tongue, to mock them, and just laugh and laugh! 😂\n\n“You’re either crazy, or…” Zametov started, then paused, as if struck by a sudden thought. \n\n“Or? Or what? Spill it!” \n\n“Nothing,” Zametov snapped, getting annoyed. “It’s all nonsense!” \n\nThey fell silent. After that burst of laughter, Raskolnikov turned serious and gloomy. He rested his elbow on the table and leaned his head on his hand, completely zoning out on Zametov. The silence stretched on. \n\n“Why aren’t you drinking your tea? It’s getting cold,” Zametov said. \n\n“What? Tea? Oh, right…” Raskolnikov took a sip, popped a piece of bread in his mouth, and suddenly looked at Zametov as if remembering everything. He pulled himself together, and his face shifted back to its original expression.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a moment of intense reflection and emotional turmoil, recalling a past moment of tension while conversing with Zametov."
