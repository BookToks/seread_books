It was strange and kind of silly that he stopped at the same spot, like he thought he could still care about the same thoughts and ideas from not too long ago. It was funny but also painful. Deep down, everything from his past—his old thoughts, problems, and memories—felt so far away and out of reach. It was like he was soaring upwards, and everything was fading away.\n\nWithout thinking, he noticed the coin in his hand. He opened his fist, stared at it, and then tossed it into the water like it was nothing. After that, he turned around and headed home. In that moment, he felt completely cut off from everyone and everything.\n\nBy the time he got home, evening was setting in. He must have wandered for about six hours, but he couldn’t remember how he got back. When he undressed, he felt shaky like a horse that had been pushed too hard. He lay down on the sofa, pulled his coat over himself, and immediately fell into a deep sleep.\n\nThen, he was jolted awake by a terrifying scream. Seriously, it was the most horrifying sound he’d ever heard—howling, wailing, and chaos like nothing he could have imagined. He sat up in bed, nearly fainting from the shock.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist reflects on his past and feels a profound disconnection from his former self before being jolted awake by a horrifying scream."
