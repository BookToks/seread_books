Talked to the editor; I know him. I was really into it.” \n\n“I analyzed, if I recall, the mindset of a criminal before and after they commit a crime.” \n\n“Right, and you argued that committing a crime always comes with some kind of illness. Super original, but honestly, what caught my attention was an idea at the end that you didn’t really flesh out. You hinted that some people can… not exactly that they should, but they have a right to break moral rules and laws.” \n\nRaskolnikov smirked at the twist on his idea. \n\n“What? A right to commit crimes? But not because of their environment, right?” Razumihin asked, sounding worried. \n\n“Not exactly that,” Porfiry replied. “In your article, you split people into ‘ordinary’ and ‘extraordinary.’ Ordinary folks have to follow the rules; they can’t break the law because they’re just regular. But extraordinary people? They can commit any crime they want just because they’re extraordinary. That was your point, wasn’t it?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The conversation revolves around the distinction between \"ordinary\" and \"extraordinary\" individuals regarding their moral and legal rights to commit crimes."
