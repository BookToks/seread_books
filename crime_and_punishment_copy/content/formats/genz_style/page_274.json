  "text": "Raskolnikov was feeling pretty weak, so he quickly agreed to take some powder. “Two, if you want,” he said. The powder was taken right away.\n\nZossimov, a doctor, told Razumihin it was good they were getting Raskolnikov home. “We’ll see how he is tomorrow. He’s already looking better since this afternoon. Live and learn, right?”\n\nAs soon as they hit the street, Razumihin couldn’t help but spill some tea. “You won’t believe what Zossimov whispered to me! He thinks you might be losing it. Can you imagine? You’ve got way more brains than he does! And honestly, if you’re not mad, who cares what he thinks? That guy is obsessed with mental illness now, and he got this wild idea from your chat with Zametov.”\n\n“Zametov told you everything?” Raskolnikov asked.\n\n“Yep, and he did the right thing. Now I get what’s going on, and so does Zametov. Here’s the deal, Rodya… I might be a bit tipsy right now, but listen. This idea about you? It’s brewing in their heads. No one wants to say it out loud because it sounds ridiculous, especially after that painter got arrested. It's all just a bubble waiting to burst.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's mental state is under scrutiny by his friends, who suspect he may be mad due to his recent behavior and conversations."
