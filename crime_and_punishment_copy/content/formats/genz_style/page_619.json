  "text": "\"Look,\" she said, \"he's got time for his girl.\" By \"girl,\" she means Sofya Semyonovna—your fiancée or whatever. I went straight to Sofya’s place to see what was up. I walked in, saw the coffin, kids crying, and Sofya trying on mourning dresses. No sign of you. I apologized, left, and told Avdotya Romanovna. So all that talk about having a girl? Total nonsense. You’re probably losing it. \n\nBut here you are, scarfing down boiled beef like you haven’t eaten in days. Sure, crazy people eat too, but even without a word from you, I can tell you’re not mad! I’d bet my life on it! So you can all go to hell because something’s fishy, and I’m not going to stress over your secrets. I just came here to vent. And now I know what to do.\n\n“What are you planning to do?” \n\n“Not your business!” \n\n“You’re about to go on a drinking spree.” \n\n“How did you know?” \n\n“It’s obvious.” \n\nRazumihin paused for a moment. “You’ve always been rational. You’ve never been mad, not once,” he said, feeling warm. “You’re right. I’m going to drink. Later!” And he turned to leave. “I was talking with my sister about you—day before yesterday, I think.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The conversation reveals a character's confusion about another's mental state and intentions, leading to a declaration of impending drinking."
