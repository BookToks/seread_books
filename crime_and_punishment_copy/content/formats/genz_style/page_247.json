  "text": "Raskolnikov stopped at each landing, looking around with curiosity. The first landing had its window frame removed. \"That wasn’t like this before,\" he thought. He reached the second floor, where Nikolay and Dmitri had been working. “It’s shut up and freshly painted. Must be for rent.” \n\nHe moved to the third and fourth floors. “Wait!” He was surprised to find the door wide open. He heard voices inside—totally unexpected. After a moment of hesitation, he climbed the last stairs and entered. \n\nInside, the flat was being renovated. Workmen were busy, which shocked him. He had expected everything to be just as he left it, maybe even the corpses still on the floor. Instead, there were bare walls and no furniture. It felt weird. He walked over to the window and sat on the sill.\n\nTwo young workmen were there, one noticeably younger than the other. They were putting up fresh white wallpaper with lilac flowers, replacing the old, grimy yellow. Raskolnikov felt a wave of annoyance at this change. He looked at the new wallpaper like it was a personal offense. The workmen seemed to be rushing to wrap things up and didn’t notice him. They kept chatting as he folded his arms and listened.\n\n“She comes to me in the morning,” said the older one to the younger. “All dressed up. I asked, ‘Why are you primping so much?’ She replies, ‘I’m ready to do anything to please you, Tit Vassilitch!’ Can you believe that?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is disturbed to find the flat he once knew being renovated and occupied by workmen, contrasting his memories of the past."
