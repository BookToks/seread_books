His question felt weird, like he was circling around something deeper.\n\n“I figured you’d ask something like that,” she replied, eyeing him curiously.\n\n“Yeah, but how do you answer?” he shot back.\n\n“Why ask about something impossible?” Sonia said hesitantly.\n\n“So, you think it’s better for Luzhin to keep living and being evil? You can’t even make that call!” he pressed.\n\n“I can’t know what Divine Providence wants. Why bring up questions that can’t be answered? Who made me the judge of life and death?” \n\nRaskolnikov frowned. “If Divine Providence is involved, then what’s the point?” \n\n“Just say what you mean!” Sonia exclaimed, clearly upset. “Are you here just to mess with me?” \n\nOverwhelmed, she started to cry. He watched her, feeling heavy with despair. Five minutes passed in silence.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov questions Sonia about the moral implications of choosing between the lives of Luzhin and Katerina Ivanovna, leading to her distress and tears."
