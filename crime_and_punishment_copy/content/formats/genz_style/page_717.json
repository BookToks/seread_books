And wow, you’re all muddy!”  \n“I got caught in the rain yesterday, Mom…,” Raskolnikov started.  \n“No, no,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna cut in quickly, “I thought you were worried I’d grill you like I used to. Don’t stress, I get it now. I see things differently here. I won’t keep asking about your plans or what’s on your mind. Honestly, I don’t know what you’re up to, and it’s not my place to keep bugging you. But why am I pacing around like a madwoman? I’m reading your article in the magazine for the third time, Rodya. Dmitri Prokofitch brought it to me. The moment I saw it, I thought, ‘There it is! That’s what he’s been working on!’ Smart people often do stuff like that. You might have new ideas brewing, and I don’t want to stress you out. I read it, and sure, a lot of it went over my head, but that’s normal—how could I understand everything?”  \n“Let me see, Mom.”  \nRaskolnikov took the magazine and skimmed his article. Even though it felt out of place with how he was feeling, he couldn’t shake that weird mix of pride and bitterness.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's mother expresses her understanding of his complex thoughts and plans while reflecting on her emotional state since his father's death."
