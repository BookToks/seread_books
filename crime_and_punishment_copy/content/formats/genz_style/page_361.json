My throat’s dry,” Razumihin chimed in.  \n“Great idea! We can all join you for tea. Want something stronger before that?”  \n“Get out of here with that!”  \nPorfiry Petrovitch left to grab the tea.  \n\nRaskolnikov’s mind was racing. He was furious.  \n“The worst part? They’re not even hiding it! They act like it’s no big deal to talk about me to Nikodim Fomitch. They’re tracking me like dogs, just spitting in my face.” He was shaking with anger. “Come on, just hit me already! Don’t toy with me like I’m some mouse. It’s rude, Porfiry Petrovitch, but maybe I’ll stand up and throw the truth right in your faces. You’ll see how much I despise you.” He could barely breathe. “But what if I’m just imagining things? What if I’m wrong, and I’m just getting worked up for no reason? Maybe they don’t mean anything by it. Their words sound normal, but there’s something off… Why did he say ‘with her’ so bluntly? Why did Zametov say I was being crafty? Why do they talk like that?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels exasperated and paranoid about being tracked and judged by those around him."
