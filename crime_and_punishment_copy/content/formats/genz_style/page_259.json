  "text": "Katerina Ivanovna worked late into the night, pushing herself to the limit while everyone else slept. She needed to get the wet laundry hung up to dry by morning. When Raskolnikov asked her to grab a basin of water, she nearly collapsed under the weight. But he found a towel, wet it, and started cleaning the blood off Marmeladov’s face.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna stood nearby, struggling to breathe and holding her chest. She needed help too. Raskolnikov began to think bringing Marmeladov here might not have been the best idea. The policeman looked unsure as well.\n\n“Polenka!” Katerina Ivanovna called out. “Run to Sonia, quickly! If she’s not home, tell her that her dad got run over and she needs to come here right away. Hurry, Polenka! Here, take this shawl.”\n\n“Run fast!” the little boy on the chair suddenly yelled before going back to sitting still, eyes wide, heels down, and toes pointed out.\n\nThe room was packed with people—so crowded you could barely drop a pin. Most of Madame Lippevechsel’s lodgers had poured in from the other rooms. They started out crammed in the doorway but soon overflowed into the space. Katerina Ivanovna lost it.\n\n“Couldn’t you at least let him die in peace?” she shouted at the crowd.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna struggles to manage the chaos and concern surrounding her injured husband, Marmeladov, while Raskolnikov attempts to assist."
