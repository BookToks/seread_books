  "text": "“Heavens, Dounia,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna said as soon as they hit the street, “I feel so much better now—like a weight's been lifted. I never thought I’d feel this way after yesterday on the train.”\n\n“Mom, he’s still really sick. Can’t you see? Maybe worrying about us stressed him out. We need to be patient; a lot can be forgiven,” Dounia replied.\n\n“Well, you weren’t exactly patient!” Pulcheria shot back, a bit jealous. “You know, I was watching you two. You’re just like him—not just in looks, but in spirit. You’re both gloomy, quick-tempered, proud, and generous... He can’t be a total egoist, right? Just thinking about what’s coming tonight makes my heart sink!”\n\n“Don’t stress, Mom. What’s meant to happen will happen.”\n\n“Dounia, think about our situation! What if Pyotr Petrovitch decides to back out?” Pulcheria blurted out, worried.\n\n“If he does, he’s not worth much,” Dounia snapped back, full of disdain.\n\n“We made the right choice leaving,” Pulcheria quickly added. “He was rushing off for some business. If he gets outside for some fresh air... it’s suffocating in his room. But where can we even breathe here? The streets feel like cramped rooms. Good heavens! What a city! Watch out... they’ll crush you with whatever they’re carrying. Is that a piano? Wow, the way they’re pushing!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pulcheria Alexandrovna expresses relief at leaving a tense situation, while Dounia remains concerned about her brother's health and the potential fallout from their current circumstances."
