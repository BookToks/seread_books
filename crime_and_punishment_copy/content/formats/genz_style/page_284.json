To emphasize his points, he squeezed their hands like a vise, which was a bit much. He stared at Avdotya Romanovna without any concern for manners. They tried to pull their hands away from his huge, bony grip, but he just grabbed them tighter. If they had told him to jump off the stairs, he probably would’ve done it without a second thought. \n\nPulcheria Alexandrovna found him a bit too odd and felt his grip was too tight, but she was worried about her son Rodya. She saw his presence as a blessing and ignored his quirks. Avdotya Romanovna shared her worries, and while she wasn’t easily scared, she couldn’t help but notice the wild look in his eyes. It was only because of Nastasya’s glowing description of her brother’s strange friend that she didn’t try to escape with her mom. She realized that running away might not even be an option now.
