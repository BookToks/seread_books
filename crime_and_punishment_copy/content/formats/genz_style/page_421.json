  "text": "\"Look, you don’t need to worry unless you’re trying to reach out to him. I’m being careful and figuring out where he’s staying.\"\n\n\"Oh, Pyotr Petrovitch, you freaked me out!\" Pulcheria Alexandrovna said. \"I’ve only met him twice, but he gives me the creeps, seriously! I’m convinced he caused Marfa Petrovna’s death.\"\n\n\"It’s hard to be sure about that. I have solid info. Sure, he might have sped things up with his bad vibes, but overall, I agree with you about his character. I’m not sure if he’s doing well financially or what Marfa Petrovna left him; I’ll find out soon. But if he has any money in Petersburg, he’ll just go back to his old ways. He’s one of the most twisted, vile guys out there. I believe Marfa Petrovna, who was foolish enough to love him and pay off his debts eight years ago, also helped him in another way. Thanks to her sacrifices, a serious criminal charge—one that could’ve sent him to Siberia—was buried. That’s the kind of guy we’re talking about.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" Pulcheria Alexandrovna exclaimed. Raskolnikov was all ears.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pulcheria Alexandrovna expresses her fear of a man she believes caused Marfa Petrovna's death, while Pyotr Petrovitch describes him as depraved and dangerous, hinting at his criminal past."
