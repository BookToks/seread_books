Then he suddenly realized Sonia planned to go with him.\n\n\"What are you doing? Where are you going? Stay here! I’ll go alone,\" he said, feeling cowardly and annoyed as he moved toward the door. \"What’s the point of this procession?\" he muttered while leaving.\n\nSonia stood in the middle of the room. He hadn’t even said goodbye; he totally forgot her. A wave of doubt hit him hard.\n\n\"Was this right? Was it really right?\" he wondered as he went down the stairs. \"Couldn’t he just stop and take it all back… and not go?\"\n\nBut he kept going. He realized he shouldn’t question himself anymore. As he stepped into the street, he remembered he hadn’t said goodbye to Sonia, leaving her there in her green shawl.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences agitation and doubt as he prepares to leave Sonia, feeling a mix of cowardice and rebellion about his decision."
