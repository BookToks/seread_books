He was in a dark, feverish state (he had been alone for way too long). Sonia sensed that his bleak beliefs had become his new religion.\n\n“I figured it out, Sonia,” he said, fired up. “Power is only for those who are brave enough to grab it. There’s just one thing you need: you have to dare! For the first time, I had an idea that no one else had ever thought of. It hit me how bizarre it is that no one in this crazy world has had the guts to just go for it and toss everything else aside! I… I wanted that courage… and I killed her. That was the whole reason!” \n\n“Oh, stop, stop!” Sonia exclaimed, putting her hands together. “You turned away from God, and now you’re cursed! The devil has taken you!” \n\n“Then Sonia, when I was lying there in the dark and everything became clear, was that the devil tempting me?” \n\n“Stop joking, blasphemer! You don’t get it, you really don’t! Oh God! He won’t understand!” \n\n“Be quiet, Sonia! I’m not laughing. I know it was the devil leading me. Please, just be quiet!” he insisted darkly. “I know it all. I’ve thought it through.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov believes that true power comes from daring to take extreme actions, which he justifies as the reason for his crime."
