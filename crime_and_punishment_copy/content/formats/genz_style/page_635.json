  "text": "He’s a unique guy, you know? Kind of child-like, not really a coward but definitely an artist at heart. Seriously, don’t laugh at me for saying that. He’s innocent and easily influenced. He’s got a big heart and is super talented. People come from other villages just to hear him sing and tell stories. He’s in school too, and he laughs so hard he cries if you just point at him. \n\nSometimes he drinks a lot, but it’s not like he’s a full-on addict—just when people treat him like a kid. And yeah, he stole something once, but he didn’t even realize it. He thought, “How can it be stealing if I just picked it up?” Oh, and he’s an Old Believer (a type of religious dissenter). His family has some Wanderers in it, and he spent two years learning from an elder in his village. I got all this from Nikolay and the locals.\n\nHere’s the kicker: he wanted to escape to the wild! He was super passionate, praying at night and reading the old, “true” books until he went a bit nuts. But then he came to Petersburg, and it changed him—especially the women and the wine. He started forgetting about the elder and all that. I heard an artist took a liking to him and started visiting, and then everything went downhill.\n\nHe got so scared he tried to hang himself! He ran away! It’s tough to shake off what people think about Russian trials. Just hearing the word “trial” freaks some of them out. Whose fault is that? We’ll see what the new jury system does. Fingers crossed they make things better! Well, in prison...\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage describes a young, innocent man who, influenced by his environment and experiences, struggles with his identity and the fear of legal consequences."
