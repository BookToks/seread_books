I’m ready to swear on it!\" Lebeziatnikov said, looking at everyone.\n\n\"Are you out of your mind, you wimp?\" Luzhin shot back. \"She’s right here! She just said I only gave her ten roubles. How could I have given her more?\"\n\n\"I saw it, I saw it,\" Lebeziatnikov insisted. \"Even though it goes against my principles, I’d swear in court right now. I saw you slip that note into her pocket. I thought you did it out of kindness! When you were saying goodbye, you held her hand with one hand and slipped the note in with the other. I saw it all!\"\n\nLuzhin turned pale. \"What lies!\" he yelled, trying to act tough. \"How could you see the note from the window? You probably imagined it with your bad eyesight. You’re losing it!\"\n\n\"No, I didn’t imagine anything. I was standing a bit away, but I saw everything. Sure, it’s hard to tell a note from that distance, but I know it was a hundred-rouble note because when you gave Sofya Semyonovna ten roubles, you picked up a hundred-rouble note from the table (I was close enough to see that).”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Lebeziatnikov accuses Luzhin of deceitfully giving a hundred-rouble note to Sofya, contradicting Luzhin's claim of only giving her ten roubles."
