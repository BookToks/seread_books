I have to go now…”  \n“Can’t I come with you?”  \n“No, but please kneel and pray for me. Your prayer might reach Him.”  \n“Let me bless you and make the sign of the cross. That’s right. Oh, God, what are we doing?”  \n\nHe felt a strange relief that they were alone. For the first time in ages, his heart softened. He dropped to his knees, kissed her feet, and they both cried, embracing. She didn’t question him this time. She had sensed something terrible was happening to her son, and now it felt like a breaking point had arrived.  \n\n“Rodya, my darling, my firstborn,” she sobbed, “you’re just like when you were little. You’d run to me, hug me, and kiss me. Back when your dad was alive and we were struggling, just having you around comforted us. When I buried your father, we cried together at his grave, just like now. If I’ve been upset lately, it’s because a mother’s heart knows when something’s wrong. The first time I saw you here, I could tell from your eyes. My heart sank. And today, when I opened the door and saw you, I thought the worst had come.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov shares an emotional farewell with his mother, expressing love and a sense of impending trouble."
