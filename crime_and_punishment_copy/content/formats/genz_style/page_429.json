  "text": "Raskolnikov shot back at Luzhin, “You wrote that I gave money yesterday not to the widow of the man who died, but to his daughter (who I hadn’t even met until yesterday). You did that to stir up drama between me and my family, and you added nasty comments about a girl you don’t even know. That’s just low.”\n\n“Excuse me,” Luzhin snapped, shaking with anger. “I only talked about your character and actions in my letter because your sister and mother asked how I found you and what I thought of you. If you think I lied, show me one false word. Prove that you didn’t waste your money and that there aren’t useless people in that family, no matter how unfortunate they are.”\n\n“I think you’re not even worth the little finger of that girl you’re throwing stones at.”\n\n“Would you really let her hang out with your mother and sister?” \n\n“I already have, just so you know. I made her sit with my mom and Dounia today.”\n\n“Rodya!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna exclaimed. Dounia turned red, and Razumihin frowned. Luzhin smirked, dripping with sarcasm.\n\n“You can see for yourself, Avdotya Romanovna, that we can’t agree. I hope this is settled once and for all. I’ll step out so you can enjoy your family time.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confronts Luzhin over his slanderous letter, defending the character of a girl Luzhin disparaged."
