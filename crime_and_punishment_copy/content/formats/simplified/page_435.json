Now, as he walked downstairs, he felt unfairly hurt and unrecognized.\n\nDounia was very important to him; he couldn't imagine life without her. For many years, he dreamed of marrying, but he kept waiting and saving money. He secretly imagined a girl who was virtuous, poor (she had to be poor), very young, pretty, well-educated, shy, and someone who had suffered a lot. He wanted her to see him as her savior, to admire and worship him alone. He imagined many romantic scenes after his work was done. \n\nNow, his long-held dream was almost real; he was impressed by Avdotya Romanovna's beauty and education. Her difficult situation attracted him even more. She was proud, strong, virtuous, and better educated than he was, and he felt that. He thought she would be grateful for his kindness and would always look up to him, giving him complete power over her.
