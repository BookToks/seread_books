  "text": "She made a sickening impression on Raskolnikov. She looked about thirty years old and was a strange wife for Marmeladov. She didn’t notice them coming in and seemed lost in her thoughts, not seeing or hearing anything. The room was stuffy, and she hadn’t opened the window. A bad smell came from the stairs, but the door to the stairs was open. Smoke from tobacco drifted in from the other rooms. She kept coughing but didn’t close the door.\n\nThe youngest child, a six-year-old girl, was asleep on the floor with her head on the sofa. A boy, a year older, was crying and shaking in the corner, probably because he had just been beaten. Next to him was a tall, thin nine-year-old girl wearing a ragged dress with an old coat over her bare shoulders. Her thin arm was around her brother’s neck, and she was trying to comfort him, whispering to keep him from crying again. At the same time, her big dark eyes, which looked even bigger because of her thin, scared face, were watching their mother with worry.\n\nMarmeladov didn’t go inside but knelt down in the doorway, pushing Raskolnikov in front of him. The woman saw a stranger and stopped, looking at him with indifference. She seemed to wonder what he was there for but then thought he was just passing through to the next room. Ignoring him, she walked to the outer door to close it and suddenly screamed.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marmeladov's wife is lost in thought amidst the chaos of their impoverished home, while their children display signs of distress."
