  "text": "Pyotr Petrovitch planned to talk about a recent fight when he got to Petersburg. He wanted to win over the younger crowd and thought Andrey Semyonovitch could help him with that. Before visiting Raskolnikov, he tried to learn some trendy phrases. \n\nHe quickly realized that Andrey was just a simple guy, but that didn’t make Pyotr feel any better. Even if all the progressive people were like Andrey, he still felt uneasy. He didn’t care about the ideas Andrey talked about; he just wanted to know what was going on. Did these people have any power? Should he be worried? Would they ruin his plans? What were they really after? Could he make friends with them if they were powerful? He had a lot of questions.\n\nAndrey Semyonovitch was a small, sickly man with odd, fluffy sideburns that he was proud of. He worked as a clerk and often had eye problems. He was kind-hearted but also very sure of himself, which made his small size seem funny. Amalia Ivanovna respected him because he didn’t drink too much and always paid his rent.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pyotr Petrovitch is anxious about the influence of the younger generation and seeks to navigate their potential power while relying on the simple-minded Andrey Semyonovitch for guidance."
