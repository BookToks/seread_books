  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nBelow, there were people, all huddled together in silence, waiting for something. Raskolnikov felt a tight grip on his heart, and his legs wouldn't move. He tried to scream but woke up instead.\n\nHe took a deep breath, but the dream felt real. His door swung open, and a man he had never seen was standing in the doorway, staring at him.\n\nRaskolnikov barely opened his eyes and quickly shut them again. He lay on his back without moving. \"Is this still a dream?\" he thought, and slowly opened his eyes again; the stranger was still there, watching him.\n\nThe man stepped carefully into the room, closed the door quietly, walked to the table, paused while looking at Raskolnikov, and sat down on a chair by the sofa. He put his hat on the floor next to him and rested his chin on his hands. It was clear he was ready to wait as long as needed. From what Raskolnikov could see from his quick looks, the man was older, heavyset, with a thick, light-colored beard.\n\nTen minutes went by. It was still light outside but starting to get dark. The room was completely quiet. No sounds came from the stairs. Only a big fly buzzed against the window. Finally, it became too much for Raskolnikov. He stood up and sat on the sofa.\n\n\"Okay, tell me what you want,\" he said.\n\n\"I knew you weren't asleep, just pretending,\" the stranger replied.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is startled awake by a stranger who quietly enters his room and waits for him to acknowledge him."
