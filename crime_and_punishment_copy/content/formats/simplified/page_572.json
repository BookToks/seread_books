  "text": "\"Crime and Punishment\"\n\n\"Imagine if you had to decide whether Luzhin should keep living and doing bad things, or if Katerina Ivanovna should die. How would you choose between them? What would you say?\"\n\nSonia looked at him nervously. His question seemed strange and indirect.\n\n\"I thought you might ask something like that,\" she replied, looking at him closely.\n\n\"I figured you would. But how do we answer that?\"\n\n\"Why are you asking about something that can’t happen?\" Sonia said, hesitating.\n\n\"Would it be better for Luzhin to keep living and doing evil? You can’t even decide that!\"\n\n\"But I can’t know what Divine Providence wants. Why ask questions that have no answers? Who made me the judge of who should live or die?\"\n\n\"Oh, if Divine Providence is involved, then we can't do anything,\" Raskolnikov said gloomily.\n\n\"You should just say what you want!\" Sonia said, upset. \"You’re making me anxious again. Did you come just to hurt me?\"\n\nShe couldn’t hold back her tears and started crying hard. He looked at her with deep sadness. Five minutes went by.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov questions Sonia about the moral implications of choosing between the lives of Luzhin and Katerina Ivanovna, leading to her distress and tears."
