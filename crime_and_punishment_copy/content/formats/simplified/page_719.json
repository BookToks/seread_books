I know Dounia is smart and she loves both you and me, but I’m not sure where this will all lead. You’ve made me so happy by coming now, Rodya, but she missed you because she went out. When she comes back, I’ll tell her, “Your brother came while you were out. Where have you been?” \n\nPlease don’t spoil me, Rodya. Come when you can, but if you can’t, that’s okay. I can wait. I’ll know that you care about me, and that will be enough. I’ll read what you write, hear about you from others, and sometimes you’ll come to see me. What could be better? You’ve come now to comfort your mother, and I see that.\n\nPulcheria Alexandrovna started to cry. \n\n“Here I am again! Don’t mind my foolishness. Why am I sitting here?” she said, jumping up. “I have coffee and I didn’t offer you any. That’s the selfishness of old age. I’ll get it right away!”\n\n“Mother, don’t worry, I’m leaving soon.

Who would tell me anything about you?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Rodya seeks reassurance from his mother about her unconditional love for him despite any future troubles he may face."
