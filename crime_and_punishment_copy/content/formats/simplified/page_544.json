Katerina couldn't help but laugh so hard that Amalia Ivanovna got annoyed and barely controlled herself.\n\n“Listen to the owl!” Katerina whispered, feeling better. “She meant to say he keeps his hands in his pockets, but she said he puts his hands in other people's pockets. (Cough-cough.) And have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that all these foreigners in Petersburg, especially the Germans, are dumber than us? Can you imagine any of us saying how ‘Karl from the chemist’s’ ‘pierced his heart from fear’ and that the fool, instead of punishing the cab driver, ‘clasped his hands and cried, and begged a lot’? Ah, what an idiot! And she thinks it’s very touching and doesn’t realize how silly she is! In my opinion, that drunk clerk is much smarter; you can tell he’s messed up his mind with alcohol, but these foreigners are always so polite and serious… Look at her glaring! She’s angry, ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.)”\n\nFeeling better, Katerina Ivanovna immediately told Raskolnikov that when she got her pension, she wanted to open a school for the daughters of gentlemen in her hometown, T——. This was the first time she mentioned the idea to him, and she started sharing all the exciting details. It turned out that Katerina Ivanovna had the very certificate of honor that Marmeladov had talked about with Raskolnikov.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna, regaining her good humor, shares her dream of opening a school for the daughters of gentlemen while mocking the behavior of foreigners."
