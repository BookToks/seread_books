  "text": "Polenka fell to her mother’s feet, crying and kissing them. Kolya and Lida didn’t understand what was wrong, but they felt it was something very bad. They held each other’s shoulders, looked at each other, and suddenly started screaming. They were still in their fancy clothes, one wearing a turban and the other a cap with an ostrich feather.\n\nNext to Katerina Ivanovna on the bed was a certificate of merit. It was by the pillow, and Raskolnikov noticed it. He walked over to the window. Lebeziatnikov came up to him and said, “She is dead.”\n\n“Rodion Romanovitch, I need to talk to you,” Svidrigaïlov said as he approached. Lebeziatnikov stepped aside politely. Svidrigaïlov took Raskolnikov further away.\n\n“I will take care of everything for the funeral. It’s about money, and I have enough. I will send those two little ones and Polenka to a good orphanage. I’ll make sure they each get fifteen hundred roubles when they turn eighteen, so Sofya Semyonovna won’t have to worry about them. I will help her too, because she is a good girl, right? So tell Avdotya Romanovna that’s how I’m using her ten thousand.”\n\n“What’s your reason for being so generous?” Raskolnikov asked.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Polenka and the children react with horror to their mother's death, while Svidrigaïlov offers to arrange her funeral and support the orphans financially."
