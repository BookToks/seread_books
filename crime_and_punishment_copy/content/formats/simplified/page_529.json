  "text": "\"I don't want to be made a fool in your free marriage and raise another man's kids. That's why I want a legal marriage,\" Luzhin said, trying to respond. He looked lost in thought.\n\n\"Children? You mentioned children,\" Lebeziatnikov jumped in excitedly. \"Children are a big issue, I agree. But some people choose not to have kids because it means having a family. We can talk about kids later, but right now, let's discuss honor. I admit that’s a weak point for me. That awful military saying from Pushkin is ridiculous and won’t be in the future's dictionary. What does it even mean? It’s nonsense! There won't be any trickery in a free marriage! It's just a natural result of a legal marriage, like a way to protest. So, it’s not humiliating at all. If I ever got married legally, I would actually be happy about it. I would tell my wife, 'My dear, I loved you before, but now I respect you because you showed you can protest!' You laugh! That’s because you can’t let go of old ideas. I get now why being tricked in a legal marriage feels bad, but it’s just a nasty result of a bad situation where both people feel small. When the trickery is clear, like in a free marriage, it doesn’t exist; it’s unthinkable. Your wife will only show how much she respects you.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Luzhin argues that legal marriage is necessary to avoid humiliation and deception, while Lebeziatnikov contends that free marriage eliminates such issues by allowing open relationships."
