  "text": "“Let’s get back to business,” Porfiry said with a cheerful face, as if nothing had happened. “This is my friend Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov. He wants to meet you and has a small business matter to discuss. By the way, Zametov, what are you doing here? Have you two met before? Do you know each other well?”\n\n“What does this mean?” Raskolnikov thought, feeling uneasy. Zametov looked surprised but not too much.\n\n“We met at your place yesterday,” he said casually.\n\n“Looks like I saved myself some trouble. He’s been asking me to introduce him to you all week. You two have already figured each other out without my help. Where’s your tobacco?”\n\nPorfiry Petrovitch was wearing a clean dressing gown, fresh linen, and worn slippers. He was about thirty-five years old, short and quite stout. He was clean-shaven with short hair and a large round head, especially prominent at the back. His soft, round face had a sickly yellow color but showed a lively and somewhat ironic expression. His eyes had a watery look under almost white, blinking eyelashes, which seemed oddly serious for his rather soft appearance.\n\nAs soon as Porfiry Petrovitch learned that Raskolnikov had a small business matter to discuss, he asked him to sit down.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is introduced to Porfiry Petrovitch, indicating he has a business matter to discuss."
