  "text": "In the courtyard, Sonia turned to the right corner. The unknown man muttered, \"Bah!\" and followed her up the stairs. Sonia noticed him only then. She reached the third floor, walked down the hallway, and rang the bell at No. 9. The door had \"Kapernaumov, Tailor\" written on it in chalk. The stranger said \"Bah!\" again, surprised by the coincidence, and rang the bell next door at No. 8. The two doors were just a few yards apart.\n\n\"You live at Kapernaumov's,\" he said, looking at Sonia and laughing. \"He fixed a waistcoat for me yesterday. I'm staying close by at Madame Resslich’s. How strange!\" Sonia looked at him closely.\n\n\"We're neighbors,\" he continued happily. \"I just got to town the day before yesterday. Goodbye for now.\" Sonia didn't answer; the door opened, and she quickly went inside. She felt embarrassed and uneasy for some reason.\n\nOn the way to Porfiry’s, Razumihin seemed very excited. \n\n\"That's great, brother,\" he said several times. \"I'm glad! I'm glad!\"\n\n\"What are you glad about?\" Raskolnikov thought to himself.\n\n\"I didn't know you also pawned things at the old woman's place. How long ago was that? Was it a while since you were there?\"\n\n\"What a simple-minded fool he is!\" Raskolnikov thought.\n\n\"When was it?\" Raskolnikov stopped to think. \"It must have been two or three days before her death.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia encounters a stranger who reveals they are neighbors, leading her to feel uneasy."
