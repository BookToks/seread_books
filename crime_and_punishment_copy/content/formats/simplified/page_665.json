She really wants to suffer for someone, and if she can't find that suffering, she might jump out of a window. I’ve heard about a guy named Mr. Razumihin—he seems sensible. His name suggests it. He’s probably studying to be a priest. He should take care of your sister! I think I understand her, and I’m proud of that. But when you first meet someone, you can be careless and not see things clearly. Why is she so beautiful? It’s not my fault. It all started for me with a strong physical attraction. \n\nAvdotya Romanovna is very pure, almost too much so. I want you to know this about your sister. She is extremely chaste, even though she is very smart, and that might hold her back. There was a girl in the house named Parasha, a pretty girl with black eyes who had just come from another village. She was very pretty but also very dumb. She cried so loudly that everyone noticed and it caused a scene. One day after dinner, Avdotya Romanovna followed me into the garden and with bright eyes insisted that I leave poor Parasha alone. It was almost our first real talk alone. I was happy to do what she wanted, tried to look surprised and embarrassed, and I played my part pretty well. Then we had secret meetings and conversations.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov reflects on Avdotya Romanovna's intense chastity and her desire for suffering, while also expressing his physical attraction to her."
