  "text": "A man said to Jesus, \"Lord, he has been dead for four days and it smells bad.\" She stressed the word \"four.\"\n\nJesus replied, \"Did I not tell you that if you believe, you will see God's glory?\"\n\nThen they moved the stone from where the dead man was lying. Jesus looked up and said, \"Father, I thank You for hearing Me. I know You always hear Me, but I said this for the people standing here so they can believe that You sent Me.\"\n\nAfter saying this, He shouted loudly, \"Lazarus, come out!\"\n\nThe dead man came out, still wrapped in burial clothes, with a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, \"Unwrap him and let him go.\"\n\nMany of the Jews who had come to Mary and saw what Jesus did believed in Him.\n\nShe read this part loudly, feeling cold and excited, as if she was seeing it happen. \n\nAfter finishing, she quickly closed the book and stood up. \"That's all about Lazarus coming back to life,\" she said quietly and abruptly. Then she turned away and stood still, not looking at him. She was still shaking. The candle was flickering out, giving a dim light in the poor room where the murderer and the woman stood together.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia reads about the raising of Lazarus, deeply moved, while Raskolnikov grapples with his own turmoil and isolation."
