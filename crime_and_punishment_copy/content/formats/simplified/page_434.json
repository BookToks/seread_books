  "text": "**Crime and Punishment**  \n**Chapter III**  \n\nUp until the very end, he never thought it would end this way. He was very arrogant, never believing that two poor and helpless women could escape his control. His belief in this was made stronger by his pride and self-importance, which was almost foolish. \n\nPyotr Petrovitch had come from being nobody to thinking very highly of himself. He was obsessed with how smart and capable he was, and sometimes he would admire himself in the mirror. But what he valued most was the money he had earned through hard work and clever tricks. That money made him feel equal to those who were once better than him.\n\nWhen he reminded Dounia that he chose to take her despite bad rumors, Pyotr Petrovitch was being completely honest and truly felt angry about the “black ingratitude.” However, when he made Dounia his offer, he knew that the rumors were false. Marfa Petrovna had already denied the stories, and the townspeople supported Dounia. He wouldn’t deny knowing this at the time, but he still thought it was a big deal that he was raising Dounia to his level and saw it as something significant.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pyotr Petrovitch, blinded by vanity and self-admiration, fails to recognize the strength of the women he seeks to control and ultimately underestimates their resilience."
