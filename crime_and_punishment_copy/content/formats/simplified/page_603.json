  "text": "We are here to find a song to sing and make some money, something Kolya can dance to. Our performance is all made up on the spot. We need to plan and practice, then we can go to Nevsky where there are more people who will notice us. \n\nLida only knows \"My Village,\" but everyone sings that. We need a fancier song. Have you thought of anything, Polenka? If you could help your mother! I can’t remember anything right now. We can’t sing \"An Hussar.\" Let’s sing in French, \"Cinq sous.\" I taught it to you, and since it’s in French, people will see that you come from a good family, which will make it more special. \n\nYou could sing \"Marlborough s’en va-t-en guerre\" because it’s a children’s song and is sung as a lullaby in rich homes. \n\nShe started to sing, but then said, \"No, let’s do 'Cinq sous.' Now, Kolya, put your hands on your hips and hurry up, and Lida, turn the other way. Polenka and I will sing and clap our hands!\" \n\n\"Cinq sous, cinq sous Pour monter notre menage.\" (Cough-cough-cough!) \"Fix your dress, Polenka, it slipped down on your shoulders,\" she said, out of breath from coughing. \"Now we really need to behave nicely.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The characters are preparing for a street performance, discussing what song to sing to attract attention and money."
