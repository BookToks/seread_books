He was completely focused on a strong new feeling of life and energy that suddenly filled him. This feeling was like someone who was going to be executed but then got a surprise pardon. \n\nHalfway down the stairs, he met a priest who was going home. Raskolnikov let him pass and silently greeted him. Just as he was about to take the last steps down, he heard quick footsteps behind him. Someone caught up with him; it was Polenka. She was running after him, calling, “Wait! wait!”\n\nHe turned around. She was at the bottom of the stairs, stopping just above him. A soft light came in from the yard. Raskolnikov could see the child’s thin but pretty face, looking at him with a bright, happy smile. She had run after him to give him a message that she was excited to share.\n\n“Tell me, what is your name? … and where do you live?” she asked quickly, out of breath.\n\nHe put both hands on her shoulders and looked at her with joy. It made him so happy to see her, he couldn’t explain why.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, feeling a surge of life and strength, is approached by Polenka, who joyfully seeks to connect with him."
