  "text": "Sonia felt more and more worried and upset. She knew the dinner would not end well and saw Katerina Ivanovna getting more irritated. Sonia realized she was the main reason why the fancy ladies looked down on Katerina Ivanovna’s invitation. Amalia Ivanovna had told her that Katerina’s mother was really offended by the invitation and had asked, “How could she let her daughter sit next to that girl?” \n\nSonia sensed that Katerina Ivanovna had already heard this, and an insult to Sonia hurt Katerina Ivanovna more than if it were directed at herself or her family. Sonia knew Katerina Ivanovna wouldn’t be happy until she showed those rude ladies that they were both important. \n\nTo make things worse, someone passed Sonia a plate with two hearts pierced by an arrow, made from black bread. Katerina Ivanovna turned red and loudly called the man who sent it “a drunken fool!” \n\nAmalia Ivanovna felt something was wrong and was also hurt by Katerina Ivanovna’s pride. To lift the mood and improve her image, she started telling a story about a friend named Karl from the chemist’s. She said he was in a cab one night, and the cab driver wanted to kill him. Karl begged him not to and cried, scared for his life. \n\nEven though Katerina Ivanovna smiled, she quickly realized that Amalia Ivanovna should not be telling stories in Russian.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia feels anxious about Katerina Ivanovna's growing irritation at the dinner, aware that her presence is the source of contempt from the other guests."
