  "text": "Raskolnikov was annoyed and couldn't sleep. He thought about Dounia and felt a chill. He told himself he needed to stop thinking about her. \n\nHe realized he never really hated anyone or wanted revenge, which he thought was a bad sign. He also didn't like to argue or lose his temper, and that felt wrong too. He remembered the promises he made to her and thought maybe she could change him for the better.\n\nHe clenched his teeth and went silent again. Dounia's image came to his mind again, reminding him of a moment when she was scared after he shot the gun. He felt a pang of sadness for her.\n\n\"Ugh! Not these thoughts again! I need to stop!\" \n\nJust as he was starting to doze off, he felt something crawl over his arm and leg under the blankets, and he jumped.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov struggles with his thoughts and emotions, reflecting on his past actions and the impact they have on his relationships."
