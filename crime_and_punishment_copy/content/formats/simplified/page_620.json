  "text": "About me! But … where did you see her the day before yesterday? Razumihin stopped and looked a bit pale. You could tell his heart was beating slowly and strongly.\n\n“She came here by herself, sat there, and talked to me.”  \n“She did!”  \n“Yes.”  \n“What did you say to her … about me?”  \n“I told her you were a good, honest, and hardworking man. I didn’t say you love her because she already knows that.”  \n“She knows that?”  \n“Well, it’s pretty clear. No matter where I go or what happens to me, you will take care of them. I trust you with them, Razumihin. I say this because I know how much you love her, and I believe in your good heart. I also know she might love you, and maybe she already does. Now decide for yourself if you want to go out drinking or not.”  \n“Rodya! You see … well … Ach, forget it! But where are you going? If it’s a secret, never mind … But I … I will find out the secret … and I’m sure it’s something silly and you made it all up. Anyway, you are a great guy, a great guy!”  \n“That’s what I wanted to say too, but you interrupted. It was a good choice not to dig into these secrets. Let time handle it, don’t worry.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin expresses his concern for Rodya and his feelings for Dounia, acknowledging the possibility of mutual affection between them."
