He no longer felt the strong energy he had when he first decided to end it all. Now, he felt completely indifferent.\n\n\"Well, it’s a way out,\" he thought as he walked slowly along the canal. \"Anyway, I’ll end it, because I want to... But is it really a way out? Does it even matter? There will just be a small space—ha! But what an end! Is this really the end? Should I tell them or not? Ugh... I’m so tired! I wish I could find a place to sit or lie down soon! What I feel most embarrassed about is how silly this all is. But I don’t care about that either!

But at the first turn, he stopped and, after thinking for a minute, turned into a side street and walked two streets out of his way. Maybe he did it for no reason, or maybe to buy some time. He walked, looking down at the ground. Suddenly, he thought he heard a whisper in his ear. He looked up and realized he was standing right at the gate of the house. He hadn’t been near it since that evening. A strong, strange feeling urged him forward. He went into the house, passed through the gateway, then entered the first door on the right, and started climbing the familiar staircase to the fourth floor. The narrow, steep staircase was very dark.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist experiences a profound sense of apathy and confusion as he contemplates his fate while walking towards the police office."
