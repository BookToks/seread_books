  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nOne person, who was a low-ranking officer, was also missing. He hadn’t been himself for the last two days. The group included a Polish man, a sad-looking clerk with a spotty face and a greasy coat, who didn’t say anything and smelled terrible. There was also an old man who was deaf and almost blind, and who had worked in the post office. He had been supported by someone at Amalia Ivanovna’s for a long time.\n\nA retired clerk from the commissariat department showed up too. He was drunk, laughed loudly, and shockingly, he wasn’t even wearing a waistcoat! One visitor sat down at the table right away without even saying hello to Katerina Ivanovna. Finally, someone came in wearing a dressing gown, which was too much for the occasion, and Amalia Ivanovna and the Polish man managed to get him to leave. However, the Polish man brought two other Poles who didn’t live at Amalia Ivanovna’s and no one had seen them before. This made Katerina Ivanovna very upset. She wondered why they had prepared so much if they were just going to invite these people.\n\nTo make space for the guests, the children didn’t even have their places set at the table. The two little ones sat on a bench in the corner with their dinner on a box, while Polenka, being the older one, had to take care of them, feed them, and keep them clean like well-behaved kids.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna couldn’t help but greet her guests with more dignity and even a bit of pride. She looked at some of them sternly and invited them to sit down.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna feels frustrated and disrespected by the unrefined guests at her gathering, highlighting her struggle to maintain dignity amidst chaos."
