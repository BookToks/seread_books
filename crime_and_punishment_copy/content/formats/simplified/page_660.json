I spent seven years in the country with Marfa Petrovna, so now when I meet someone smart like you—smart and really interesting—I’m just happy to talk. Plus, I’ve had a little champagne, and it’s made me feel a bit lightheaded. There’s something that has really got me worked up, but I’ll keep quiet about that. Where are you going?” he asked, looking worried.\n\nRaskolnikov started to get up. He felt heavy and uncomfortable, as if he shouldn’t have come. He was sure that Svidrigaïlov was the worst person in the world.\n\n“Please, sit down and stay a bit!” Svidrigaïlov pleaded. “Let them bring you some tea. Stay a little longer; I won’t talk nonsense about myself. I’ll tell you something. If you want, I can share how a woman tried to ‘save’ me, as you might say? It will answer your first question, because that woman was your sister. Can I tell you? It will help pass the time.”\n\n“Go ahead, but I hope that you…”\n\n“Oh, don’t worry. Even a worthless guy like me has a lot of respect for Avdotya Romanovna.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov expresses his willingness to share a story about Raskolnikov's sister, Avdotya Romanovna, while acknowledging his own flaws."
