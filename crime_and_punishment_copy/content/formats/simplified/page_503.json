When you came, maybe drunk, and told the porters to go to the police station and ask about the blood, I was angry that they let you go. I thought you were drunk. I was so angry that I couldn’t sleep. Remembering the address, we came here yesterday and asked for you….”\n\n“Who came?” Raskolnikov interrupted, starting to remember.\n\n“I did. I’ve wronged you.”\n\n“So you came from that house?” Raskolnikov asked.\n\n“I was standing at the gate with them… don’t you remember? We’ve worked in that house for years. We prepare and cure hides, we take work home… mostly I was upset….”\n\nThe whole scene from the day before yesterday in the gateway came back to Raskolnikov's mind. He remembered there were several people there besides the porters, including some women. He recalled one voice suggesting taking him straight to the police station.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov encounters a man who admits to feeling guilty for having evil thoughts about him."
