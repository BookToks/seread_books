  "text": "**Crime and Punishment**  \n**Chapter III**\n\nHe woke up late the next day after a bad night’s sleep. But he didn’t feel better; he woke up feeling sick, grumpy, and angry, and he looked at his room with disgust. \n\nHis room was very small, about six steps long. It looked poor, with dusty yellow wallpaper peeling off the walls, and it was so low that a tall person would feel uncomfortable and might hit their head on the ceiling. The furniture matched the room: there were three old, shaky chairs, and a painted table in the corner with some manuscripts and books on it. The thick dust on them showed they hadn’t been touched in a long time. \n\nA big, awkward sofa took up almost one whole wall and half the floor space; it used to have a nice cover, but now it was in tatters and served as Raskolnikov's bed. He often fell asleep on it without changing clothes, without sheets, just wrapped in his old student coat, with his head on a small pillow. Under the pillow, he piled all the linens he had, both clean and dirty, to use as a cushion. A little table stood in front of the sofa. \n\nIt would have been hard to have a messier room, but for Raskolnikov, in his current mood, this was actually comforting. He felt completely alone, like a tortoise in its shell, and even the sight of his surroundings didn’t bother him.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov wakes up in a disheveled, oppressive room, feeling irritable and disconnected from the world around him."
