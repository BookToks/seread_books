They just started talking about big questions and lost focus.’  \n‘Can you believe what we talked about yesterday? Whether crime really exists. I told you we talked a lot.’  \n‘What’s so strange about that? It’s a common social question,’ Raskolnikov replied casually.  \n‘It wasn’t exactly asked that way,’ Porfiry noted.  \n‘That’s true,’ Razumihin quickly agreed, getting excited as usual. ‘Listen, Rodion, I want to hear your opinion. I was really arguing with them and wanted you to back me up. I told them you were coming…. It all started with the socialist idea. You know their idea; they say crime is just a reaction to how messed up society is and nothing more, no other reasons allowed!’  \n‘You’re wrong about that,’ Porfiry said, clearly getting more animated and laughing at Razumihin, which made him even more excited.  \n‘Nothing else is allowed,’ Razumihin interrupted passionately.  \n‘I’m not wrong. I can show you their pamphlets. They believe everything is about ‘the influence of environment,’ and nothing else. That’s their favorite saying! So, if society is set up properly, all crime would stop right away because there would be nothing to fight against.’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The conversation revolves around the idea that crime is viewed as a protest against societal abnormalities, according to socialist doctrine."
