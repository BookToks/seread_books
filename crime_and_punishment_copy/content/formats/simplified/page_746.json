  "text": "Rodion Raskolnikov hid the jewelry and the purse under a stone without using them. He couldn't remember what the jewelry looked like or how many pieces there were. It seemed hard to believe that he never opened the purse or knew how much money was inside. In the purse, there was three hundred and seventeen roubles and sixty copecks. Some of the money got damaged from being wet for so long.\n\nLawyers were confused about why he would lie about this when he had been honest about everything else. Some lawyers who knew about psychology thought it was possible he really didn't look in the purse and didn't know what was inside when he hid it. They concluded that he must have committed the crime because of a temporary mental breakdown, not for any specific reason or to gain something. This idea fit with a popular theory of temporary insanity used in criminal cases today.\n\nMany witnesses, including Dr. Zossimov, his old classmates, his landlady, and her servant, confirmed that Raskolnikov was not acting like a normal murderer or thief. This suggested there was something different about his situation. Despite this, Raskolnikov barely tried to defend himself when asked why he committed the crime.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's confession and the circumstances of his crime suggest a complex interplay of mental derangement and poverty rather than straightforward criminal intent."
