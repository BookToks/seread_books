  "text": "Raskolnikov had a scary dream. He dreamed he was a child again in the small town where he was born. He was about seven years old, walking in the countryside with his father on a holiday evening. It was a grey, gloomy day, and the countryside looked just like he remembered, even better in the dream than in real life.\n\nThe little town was flat and empty, with no trees nearby, just a dark patch in the distance. A big tavern stood a few steps beyond the last garden, and it always made him feel uneasy and scared when he walked past it with his father. There were always crowds there, full of shouting, laughter, and mean singing, and sometimes fights. He would cling to his father, trembling when he saw the drunken, scary people hanging around.\n\nNear the tavern, the road turned into a dusty path that was always black with dirt. It twisted and about a hundred steps later, it turned right toward the graveyard. In the middle of the graveyard was a stone church with a green dome. He used to go there two or three times a year with his parents for a service in memory of his grandmother, who had died long ago and whom he had never met. They would bring a special rice pudding with raisins shaped like a cross in a white dish wrapped in a napkin. He loved that church, with its simple icons and the old priest who had a shaking head.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov dreams of his childhood, recalling a fearful visit to a tavern and a graveyard with his father."
