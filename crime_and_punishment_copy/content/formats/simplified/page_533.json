  "text": "Sometimes Katerina Ivanovna would feel embarrassed and make up stories about her new friends, believing they were true. But then, suddenly, she would be disappointed and treat the person she had just admired with disrespect. Katerina was usually cheerful and wanted everyone to be happy, but all her bad luck made her wish for peace so much that even the smallest problem would drive her crazy. She would quickly go from having bright hopes to cursing her bad luck and banging her head against the wall.\n\nAmalia Ivanovna became very important to Katerina Ivanovna and was treated with a lot of respect, probably because Amalia had worked hard on the preparations. She took care of setting the table, getting the dishes, and cooking in her kitchen while Katerina went to the cemetery. Everything was done well. The tablecloth was almost clean, and although the dishes and utensils were all different shapes and patterns from various lodgers, the table was set on time. Amalia, feeling proud of her work, wore a black silk dress and a cap with new mourning ribbons to greet the returning group. However, this pride seemed to annoy Katerina for some reason.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna's emotional instability leads her to oscillate between adoration and contempt for those around her, particularly Amalia Ivanovna, whose efforts she simultaneously respects and resents."
