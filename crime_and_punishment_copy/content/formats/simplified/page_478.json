  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nPorfiry Petrovitch joked about using silly questions to catch someone off guard. He laughed and said that he was just being ironic. He then shifted the topic to formality in legal inquiries. He questioned the usefulness of formalities, saying they can be pointless. Sometimes, a friendly chat can reveal more than strict rules. He assured Raskolnikov that formalities can always be used later if needed. \n\nPorfiry took a breath and continued talking. He had been rambling and mixing in strange words, becoming less clear. He moved around the room quickly, looking at the floor and gesturing wildly. Raskolnikov noticed that Porfiry paused near the door a couple of times, as if he was waiting for something. \n\nRaskolnikov wondered if Porfiry was expecting someone. Porfiry, looking very simple and cheerful, agreed that Raskolnikov was right to laugh at legal formalities.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry Petrovitch discusses the ineffectiveness of formalities in legal investigations while engaging Raskolnikov in seemingly trivial conversation."
