  "text": "\"What do you mean? Understand... what?\" Zametov asked, looking worried.\n\nRaskolnikov's serious face suddenly changed, and he began to laugh nervously, as if he couldn't help it. In a flash, he remembered a recent moment when he stood with an axe behind a door, while men outside shook it and swore. He felt a strong urge to shout at them, to curse them, to stick out his tongue, to mock them, and just laugh and laugh!\n\n\"You are either crazy, or...\" Zametov started to say, but then he stopped, shocked by the thought that came to him.\n\n\"Or? Or what? What? Come on, tell me!\" Raskolnikov urged.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Zametov said, getting angry. \"It's all nonsense!\"\n\nThey both fell silent. After his sudden laughter, Raskolnikov became serious and sad. He rested his elbow on the table and leaned his head on his hand, seeming to forget about Zametov. The silence went on for a while.\n\n\"Why don’t you drink your tea? It’s getting cold,\" Zametov said.\n\n\"What? Tea? Oh, yes...\" Raskolnikov took a sip, put a piece of bread in his mouth, and suddenly looked at Zametov, as if he remembered everything and pulled himself together. At that moment, his face returned to its serious look.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a moment of intense reflection and emotional turmoil, recalling a past moment of tension while conversing with Zametov."
