This house was divided into small apartments and was home to all kinds of working people—like tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans, girls trying to make a living, and small office workers. People were always coming and going through the two gates and courtyards of the building. There were three or four doormen working there. The young man was happy not to see any of them and quickly slipped through the door on the right and up the stairs.\n\nIt was a dark and narrow back staircase, but he was used to it and knew his way. He liked being in this darkness because it kept curious eyes away. \n\n“If I’m so scared now, how will I feel if I actually go through with it?” he thought as he reached the fourth floor. There, he was stopped by some movers carrying furniture out of an apartment. He knew that a German clerk and his family had lived there, and now they were moving out. So, the fourth floor would only have the old woman left. “That’s good,” he thought as he rang the bell of her apartment. The bell made a soft sound, like it was made of tin.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The young man nervously approaches the old woman's flat, feeling increasingly anxious about his intentions."
