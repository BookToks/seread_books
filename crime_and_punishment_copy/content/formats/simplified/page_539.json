I don’t understand why Pyotr Petrovitch hasn’t come. But where’s Sonia? Where did she go? Oh, there she is! Sonia, where have you been? It’s strange that you’re late even at your father’s funeral. Rodion Romanovitch, make space for her next to you. That’s your spot, Sonia... take what you want. Have some of the cold dish with jelly; it’s the best. They’ll bring the pancakes soon. Have they given the kids some? Polenka, do you have everything? (Cough-cough-cough.) That’s fine. Be a good girl, Lida, and Kolya, stop moving your feet; sit like a little gentleman. What are you saying, Sonia?\"\n\nSonia quickly told her Pyotr Petrovitch's apologies, trying to speak loudly enough for everyone to hear and carefully choosing respectful words. She added that Pyotr Petrovitch said he would come as soon as he could to talk about business with her and see what could be done.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna expresses frustration over the guests at her husband's funeral and is concerned about the absence of certain individuals."
