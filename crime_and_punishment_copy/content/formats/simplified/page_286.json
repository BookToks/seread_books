  "text": "\"Crime and Punishment\"\n\n\"But I am a fool, too! No matter! Come along! Do you trust me? Come, do you trust me or not?\"\n\n\"Let us go, mother,\" said Avdotya Romanovna. \"He will definitely do what he promised. He has already helped Rodya, and if the doctor will really stay the night here, what could be better?\"\n\n\"You see, you understand me because you are an angel!\" Razumihin said excitedly. \"Let us go! Nastasya! Run upstairs and sit with him with a light; I’ll come in fifteen minutes.\"\n\nThough Pulcheria Alexandrovna wasn't completely sure, she didn't resist anymore. Razumihin took an arm of each woman and led them down the stairs. He still made her uneasy. Even though he seemed friendly and kind, could he really keep his promise? He looked like he was in a strange state.\n\n\"Ah, I see you think I am in such a state!\" Razumihin said, guessing her thoughts as he walked quickly down the street, making it hard for the two ladies to keep up. He didn’t notice, though. \"Nonsense! I am drunk like a fool, but it’s not because of wine. Seeing you has made me dizzy. But don’t mind me! Don’t pay attention: I am talking nonsense, I don’t deserve you. I am completely unworthy of you! As soon as I get you home, I’ll splash some water on my head here, and then I’ll be fine. If only you knew how much I love you both! Don’t laugh and don’t be mad! You can be mad at anyone, but not at me! I am his friend.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin expresses his deep affection and concern for Avdotya and her mother while assuring them of his commitment to help Rodya."
