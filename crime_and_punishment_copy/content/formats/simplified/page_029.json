  "text": "Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock, the civil counselor, hasn’t paid Katerina Ivanovna for the six linen shirts she made for him. He treated her badly, sending her away while yelling at her because the collars were not made exactly like the pattern. The kids are hungry, and Katerina Ivanovna is pacing back and forth, wringing her hands, her cheeks red from her illness. She says, “You live here, eat and drink, but you do nothing to help.” But there’s hardly any food for the kids; they haven’t eaten for three days!\n\nI was lying there drunk when I heard Sonia speaking. She’s a kind girl with a soft voice, fair hair, and a pale, thin face. She asked Katerina Ivanovna, “Am I really supposed to do that?” Darya Frantsovna, a woman known for trouble and with a bad reputation, had tried to get to Sonia through the landlady a few times. Katerina Ivanovna replied sarcastically, “Why not? You’re so special!” But don’t blame her; she wasn’t herself when she said that. She was upset because of her illness and the kids crying from hunger. She said it to hurt Sonia more than anything else. That’s just how Katerina Ivanovna is; when the kids cry, even from being hungry, she starts to hit them right away.\n\nAt six o’clock, I saw Sonia get up, put on her headscarf and cape, and leave the room. She came back around nine. She walked straight up to Katerina.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna struggles with poverty and desperation, driven to distraction by her family's hunger and illness."
