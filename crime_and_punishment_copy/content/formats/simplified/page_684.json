  "text": "Dounia looked around Svidriga誰lov's flat, which had two big furnished rooms. She felt uneasy but didn't notice anything unusual about the furniture or the layout. However, she saw that his flat was between two almost empty apartments. His rooms were not accessed directly from the hallway; instead, you had to go through the landlady's two nearly empty rooms.\n\nSvidriga誰lov unlocked a door from his bedroom to show Dounia the two empty rooms for rent. Dounia stood in the doorway, unsure of what she was supposed to see, but Svidriga誰lov quickly explained.\n\n\"Look at this second big room. See that door? It's locked. There's a chair next to it, the only one in these two rooms. I brought it from my place so I could listen more easily. Just on the other side of the door is Sofya Semyonovna's table; she was sitting there talking to Rodion Romanovitch. I listened for two hours on two different evenings, and I learned something. What do you think?\"\n\n\"You listened?\" Dounia asked.\n\n\"Yes, I did. Now let's go back to my room; we can't sit here,\" he said. He led Dounia back to his sitting room and offered her a chair. He sat down across the table from her, about seven feet away.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidriga誰lov reveals to Dounia that he has been eavesdropping on conversations between her and Rodion from a hidden position in his flat."
