  "text": "The day before, Raskolnikov felt like he was seeing things because he was sick and stressed. This thought had started to grow stronger while he was scared and hopeless. Now, as he prepared for another fight, he noticed he was shaking. He felt angry that he was shaking out of fear of facing Porfiry Petrovitch, the man he hated deeply. He was worried that his hatred might give him away. His anger made him stop shaking. He decided to go in with a cold and proud attitude and promised himself to stay quiet, watch, listen, and control his nerves. At that moment, he was called to see Porfiry Petrovitch.\n\nWhen he entered, he found Porfiry Petrovitch alone in his office. The office was a medium-sized room with a big writing desk, a sofa covered in a checkered pattern, a dresser, a bookshelf in the corner, and some chairsâ€”all made of shiny yellow wood. There was a closed door on the far wall, leading to other rooms. As soon as Raskolnikov walked in, Porfiry Petrovitch closed the door behind him. He greeted Raskolnikov with a friendly smile, but after a few minutes, Raskolnikov noticed that Porfiry seemed a bit awkward, like he was caught off guard or involved in something secret.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels intense hatred and fear towards Porfiry Petrovitch as he prepares to confront him in a tense meeting."
