Lying behind the door?” Raskolnikov suddenly shouted, staring at Razumihin with a scared look. He slowly sat up on the sofa, leaning on his hand.\n\n“Yes… why? What’s wrong?” Razumihin also got up from his seat.\n\n“Nothing,” Raskolnikov answered quietly, turning to the wall. Everyone was silent for a moment.\n\n“He must have woken up from a dream,” Razumihin finally said, looking at Zossimov. Zossimov shook his head slightly.\n\n“Well, go on,” Zossimov said. “What happened next?”\n\n“What happened next? As soon as he saw the ear-rings, forgetting everything else, he took his cap and ran to Dushkin. He got a rouble from him. He lied, saying he found them in the street, and went off to drink. He keeps saying his old story about the murder: ‘I know nothing about it, never heard of it until the day before yesterday.’ ‘And why didn’t you go to the police until now?’ ‘I was scared.’ ‘And why did you try to hang yourself?’ ‘From worry.’ ‘What worry?’ ‘That I would be accused of it.’ That’s the whole story. So what do you think they figured out from that?”\n\n“Well, there’s no guessing. There’s a clue, even if it’s not much. You wouldn’t let your painter go free, would you?”\n\n“Now they’ve just taken him for the murderer.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's anxiety and guilt manifest as he grapples with the implications of the ear-rings found in connection to a murder."
