  "text": "\"Crime and Punishment\"\n\n\"Don’t be sad. It’s unfair!\"  \n\"Raskolnikov thought he made a good point.  \n\"Really? But the questioning is tomorrow?\" he said angrily.  \n\"Do I really have to explain things to them? I’m already annoyed that I talked to Zametov yesterday at the restaurant...\"  \n\"Forget it! I’ll go talk to Porfiry myself. I’ll get the truth from him; he has to tell me everything! And about Zametov...\"  \n\"Finally, he sees through him!\" Raskolnikov thought.  \n\"Wait!\" Razumihin said, grabbing his shoulder again. \"You’re wrong. I figured it out. How was that a trap? You think the question about the workers was a trap. But if you had done that, could you have said you saw them painting the apartment and the workers? You wouldn’t have seen anything, even if you did. Who would admit that?\"  \n\"If I had done that, I would have said I saw the workers and the apartment,\" Raskolnikov replied, clearly disgusted.  \n\"But why would you say something that hurts you?\"  \n\"Because only simple people or inexperienced beginners deny everything during questioning. If a person has any experience, they will admit the facts they can’t avoid but will look for other explanations to make them seem different.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov grapples with the psychological intricacies of his situation and the impending cross-examination regarding the murder."
