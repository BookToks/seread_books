  "text": "It’s hard to say why Katerina Ivanovna decided to have that strange dinner. She spent almost ten of the twenty roubles that Raskolnikov gave for Marmeladov’s funeral on it. Maybe Katerina wanted to honor the memory of the deceased in a way that showed the other lodgers, especially Amalia Ivanovna, that he was just as good as them, if not better, and that no one could look down on him. \n\nAnother reason could be her “poor man’s pride.” Many poor people spend their last money on social events to fit in and not be seen as lesser. Katerina might have wanted to prove to the “wretched lodgers” that she could host a proper gathering and that she came from a respectable, almost noble family, not someone meant to just clean and take care of children at night. Even the most broken people can feel these moments of pride and need to show off, and Katerina Ivanovna was not broken.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna's decision to host a lavish dinner for Marmeladov's funeral reflects her struggle with pride and the desire to assert her social status despite her poverty."
