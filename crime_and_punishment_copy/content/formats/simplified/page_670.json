  "text": "I have some news. Do you know that I am going to get married?  \n\"You told me that before.\"  \n\"Did I? I forgot. But I couldn't have told you for sure because I hadn't even met my fiancée yet; I just planned to. But now I really have a fiancée, and it’s official. If I didn’t have important business, I would take you to meet her right away because I want your advice. Oh, there's only ten minutes left! Look at the watch. But I need to tell you about my marriage; it’s an interesting story. Where are you going? Leaving again?\"  \n\"No, I'm not leaving now.\"  \n\"Not at all? We'll see. I’ll take you to meet my fiancée, just not now. You have to go right, and I have to go left. Do you know Madame Resslich, the woman I’m living with now? I know what you’re thinking—she's the one whose daughter drowned in the winter. Listen, she set this up for me. She said I was bored and needed something to do. You know I’m a gloomy person. Do you think I’m cheerful? No, I’m gloomy. I don’t bother anyone; I just sit quietly for three days without saying a word. And that Resslich is tricky, I tell you. I know what she’s planning; she thinks I’ll get tired of my wife and leave, and then she’ll take my fiancée and make money off her—probably with someone in our class or higher. She told me the father is a retired official who just sits around.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The speaker reveals their engagement and expresses a desire to share the story of their marriage while discussing their gloomy disposition and the intentions of their landlady."
