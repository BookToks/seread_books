I want to talk to you a bit more. Listen!” He suddenly turned to Razumihin again. “Do you know that guy… what’s his name… Porfiry Petrovitch?”\n\n“I should hope so! He’s a relative. Why?” Razumihin asked, interested.\n\n“Isn’t he the one handling that case… you know, about the murder? You were talking about it yesterday.”\n\n“Yeah… so?” Razumihin’s eyes got wide.\n\n“He was asking about people who pawned things, and I have some stuff there too—just a few small things—a ring my sister gave me when I left home, and my dad’s silver watch—they’re only worth five or six roubles together, but I care about them. So what should I do now? I don’t want to lose them, especially the watch. I was really worried just now that mother would ask to see it when we talked about Dounia’s watch. It’s the only thing from my dad we have left. She would be upset if it got lost. You know how women are. So tell me what to do. I know I should have told the police, but wouldn’t it be better to go straight to Porfiry? What do you think? It might get settled faster. You see, mother might ask for it before dinner.”\n\n“Definitely not to the police station. Definitely to Porfiry,” Razumihin shouted with excitement. “I’m so glad. Let’s go right away. It’s just a short walk. We’ll surely find him.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia expresses concern about losing her father's watch and seeks advice on how to retrieve her pawned items without alarming her mother."
