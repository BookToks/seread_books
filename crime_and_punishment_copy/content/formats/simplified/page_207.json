  "text": "A man was in the flat when Nikolay and Dmitri quickly left. He stayed there while the porter and others went upstairs. He waited until they were out of earshot, then calmly went downstairs right when Dmitri and Nikolay ran out into the street, so no one saw him. He might have been seen, but not really noticed since many people were coming and going. He probably dropped the earrings from his pocket when he stood behind the door and didn’t realize it because he was thinking about other things. The jewel-case proves he was standing there. That’s my explanation.\n\n“Too smart! No, my friend, you’re too smart. This is too much,” someone said.\n\n“But why?” \n\n“Because everything fits too perfectly... it’s too dramatic.”\n\n“A-ach!” Razumihin exclaimed, but just then, a stranger walked in through the door.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The discussion reveals a convoluted explanation of events surrounding a jewel-case and the actions of individuals involved, suggesting a complex interplay of suspicion and deduction."
