He didn’t try to move but just stared stubbornly at the flower.\n\n‘What about the painter?’ Zossimov cut in, clearly annoyed by Nastasya’s talking. She sighed and stopped.\n\n‘Well, he was accused of murder,’ Razumihin said angrily.\n\n‘Was there proof against him?’ \n\n‘Proof? There was proof that wasn’t really proof, and that’s what we need to show. They just picked those guys, Koch and Pestryakov, at first. Ugh! It’s all so stupid, it makes me sick, even though it’s not my problem! Pestryakov might come tonight. By the way, Rodya, you’ve heard about this already; it happened before you got sick, the day before you fainted at the police station while they were discussing it.’\n\nZossimov looked at Raskolnikov with curiosity. He didn’t move.\n\n‘But Razumihin, I can’t believe how nosy you are!’ Zossimov said.\n\n‘Maybe I am, but we’ll get him off anyway,’ Razumihin yelled, slamming his fist on the table. ‘What’s really annoying is not their lying—lying can be forgiven—lying can lead to the truth. What’s annoying is that they lie and love their own lies. I respect Porfiry, but… What started it all? The door was locked, and when they came back with the porter, it was open. So it seemed that Koch and Pestryakov were involved.’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin expresses frustration over the flawed evidence and dishonesty surrounding a murder accusation against a painter."
