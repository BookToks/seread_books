  "text": "He thought it was because of a heavy feeling inside him that he couldn't shake off, which came from his weakness and smallness. He looked at the other prisoners and was surprised to see how much they loved life and valued it. It seemed like they cared more about life in prison than they did when they were free. Some of them, like the tramps, had gone through awful hardships. Did they really care so much for a bit of sunlight, for the ancient forest, or for the cold spring they had found years ago and missed like they would miss a loved one, dreaming of the green grass around it and the birds singing nearby? \n\nAs he continued to observe, he noticed even more strange things. In prison, there was a lot he didn’t see and didn’t want to see; he lived with his head down. It was disgusting and hard for him to look around. But eventually, he was surprised by many things and started to notice things he hadn’t thought about before. What surprised him the most was the huge gap between him and everyone else. They felt like a different kind of people, and they looked at each other with distrust and hostility. He understood why he felt so alone, but he had never admitted to himself that the reasons were so deep and strong. Among the prisoners were some Polish exiles, political prisoners, who looked down on everyone else as if they were ignorant. But Raskolnikov couldn’t see them that way. He realized that these so-called ignorant men were, in many ways, much wiser than the Poles.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov observes the profound appreciation for life among his fellow prisoners, highlighting the deep isolation he feels despite their shared circumstances."
