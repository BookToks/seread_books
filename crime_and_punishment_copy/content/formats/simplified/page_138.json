Should I fight back or just open the door? …”\n\nHe got up a bit, leaned forward, and unlocked the door. His room was so small that he could unlock it without getting out of bed. The porter and Nastasya were standing there.\n\nNastasya looked at him in a strange way. He gave the porter a desperate look as the porter silently handed him a grey folded paper sealed with wax. \n\n“A notice from the office,” the porter said as he gave him the paper.\n\n“From what office?” \n\n“A summons to the police office, of course. You know which one.”\n\n“To the police? … What for? …”\n\n“How should I know? You’re called in, so you have to go.”\n\nThe porter looked at him closely, checked the room, and turned to leave. \n\n“He’s really sick!” Nastasya said, still watching him. The porter glanced back for a moment. “He’s been feverish since yesterday,” she added.\n\nRaskolnikov didn’t reply and held the paper in his hands without opening it. “Don’t get up then,” Nastasya said kindly, noticing that he was putting his feet down from the sofa. “You’re sick, so don’t go; there’s no rush. What do you have there?” \n\nHe looked down; in his right hand, he was holding the scraps he had cut from his trousers, a sock, and some rags from his pocket.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov receives a summons to the police office while grappling with illness and anxiety over his situation."
