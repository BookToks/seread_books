  "text": "Svidrigaïlov was at a place called Vauxhall. He realized something was missing and it started to bother him. He paid for a spoon, got up, and left the garden. It was around six o'clock. He hadn’t drunk any wine and only ordered tea to look good.\n\nThe evening was dark and hot. Around ten o'clock, storm clouds filled the sky. There was a loud clap of thunder, and then it started pouring rain. The rain fell heavily, like a waterfall. Lightning flashed every minute, and each flash lasted long enough to count to five.\n\nSoaked to the bone, he went home, locked himself in, opened a drawer, took out all his money, and tore up a few papers. He was about to change his clothes but, after looking out at the storm, he decided not to. Instead, he grabbed his hat and left without locking the door. He went straight to Sonia's house. She was there.\n\nSonia wasn't alone; she had four children with her. She was giving them tea. When she saw Svidrigaïlov's wet clothes, she quietly welcomed him. The children ran away in fear.\n\nSvidrigaïlov sat at the table and asked Sonia to sit next to him. She nervously got ready to listen.\n\n“I might be going to America, Sofya Semyonovna,” Svidrigaïlov said. “Since this could be our last meeting, I came to make some plans.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov visits Sonia to discuss his potential departure to America and make arrangements, while a storm rages outside."
