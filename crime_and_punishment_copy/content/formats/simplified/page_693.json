  "text": "You’ve made things much easier for me, Avdotya Romanovna. But where did you get the revolver? Was it Mr. Razumihin? It’s my revolver, an old friend! I’ve searched for it everywhere! The shooting lessons I gave you in the country really paid off.\n\n“It’s not your revolver; it belonged to Marfa Petrovna, whom you killed, you monster! There was nothing of yours in her house. I took it when I started to suspect what you could do. If you take one step closer, I swear I’ll kill you.” She was very upset.\n\n“But your brother? I’m just curious,” said Svidrigaïlov, still standing where he was.\n\n“Go ahead and tell! Don’t move! Don’t come any closer! I’ll shoot! You poisoned your wife; I know you’re a murderer!” She held the revolver steady.\n\n“Are you sure I poisoned Marfa Petrovna?” \n\n“You did! You hinted at it yourself; you talked to me about poison. I know you went to get it. You had it ready. It was your doing. Scoundrel!”\n\n“Even if that’s true, it was for your sake... you would have been the reason.”\n\n“You're lying! I always hated you!”\n\n“Oh, Avdotya Romanovna! You seem to have forgotten how you warmed up to me during those propaganda talks. I saw it in your eyes. Do you remember that moonlit night when the nightingale was singing?”\n\n“That’s a lie,” Dounia said, her eyes flashing with anger. “That’s a lie and a slander!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia confronts Svidrigaïlov with a revolver, accusing him of murder and refusing to let him approach her."
