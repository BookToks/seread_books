  "text": "People think they can make everyone good in an instant. They ignore human nature and believe a perfect society can come from some mathematical idea. They think this will happen faster than any real-life process. That’s why they don’t like history, calling it nothing but ugly and stupid. They don’t want to deal with real life, which has a soul that demands life. The soul doesn’t follow strict rules and is seen as a problem. \n\nWhat they want is something lifeless, like rubber, that won’t fight back. They focus on building walls and planning spaces in a perfect community. But while the community may be ready, human nature isn’t. People want real life and aren’t ready for a dead existence. You can’t ignore nature just by using logic. Logic suggests a few options, but there are actually millions. If you simplify everything to just comfort, it seems easy, but it’s misleading. The key is not to overthink it. That’s the secret of life, summed up in just a few pages! \n\n“Now he’s going off again! Someone stop him!” Porfiry laughed. “Can you believe it?” he said to Raskolnikov.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The text critiques the notion that a perfect social system can be created without considering the complexities of human nature and historical development."
