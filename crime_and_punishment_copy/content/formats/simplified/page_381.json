Maybe he got annoyed because he didn’t have any real facts and just said that out of frustration, or maybe he has some kind of plan. He seems smart. Maybe he wanted to scare me by pretending he knows something. They have their own way of thinking, brother. But it’s disgusting to explain it all. Stop!\n\n“It’s really insulting! I get what you’re saying. But now that we’ve talked openly (and I’m glad we finally did), I’ll admit that I noticed this idea in them a long time ago. It was just a small hint—an accusation—but why even hint? How dare they? If you only knew how angry I’ve been! Just think about it! A poor student, driven mad by being broke and sick, about to get really ill, who hasn’t talked to anyone in six months, wearing rags and shoes with no soles, has to deal with rude police. And then there’s this unexpected debt from Tchebarov, the heat, the crowd, and the talk about a murder that happened right where he was, all while he’s starving—he could easily faint! And that’s what they’re using against him! Damn them! I know it’s frustrating, but if I were you, Rodya, I’d just laugh at them or better yet, spit in their faces. I’d fight back in every direction and put an end to it all.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses his frustration and anger towards the police's insinuations about him, feeling insulted by their lack of evidence and understanding of his circumstances."
