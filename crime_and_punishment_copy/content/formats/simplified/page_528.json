  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nKaterina Ivanovna came back, feeling very confused.\n\nLebeziatnikov had been standing by the window or walking around the room, trying not to interrupt the talk. After Sonia left, he walked up to Pyotr Petrovitch and seriously offered his hand.\n\n“I saw and heard everything,” he said, emphasizing the word “saw.” “That was a good thing to do; it shows you care! You wanted to avoid being thanked, I noticed! And even though I don’t really agree with private charity because it doesn’t solve the problem and can even make it worse, I have to say I was pleased with what you did—yes, I liked it.”\n\n“That's nonsense,” Pyotr Petrovitch muttered, looking at Lebeziatnikov with surprise.\n\n“No, it’s not nonsense! A person who has gone through hard times like you did yesterday and still cares about other people's suffering is worthy of respect! I didn’t expect this from you, Pyotr Petrovitch, especially with your views… oh, how much your views hold you back! You were so upset about your bad luck yesterday,” said the honest Lebeziatnikov, feeling a sense of warmth towards Pyotr Petrovitch. “And why do you care so much about marriage, about being legally married? You can hit me if you want, but I’m really glad it didn’t happen, that you are free, that you haven’t completely lost your kindness…”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Lebeziatnikov expresses admiration for Pyotr Petrovitch's humane actions despite his conflicting beliefs about private charity and marriage."
