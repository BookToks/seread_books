He felt overwhelmed. \n\n“What made me think she wouldn’t be home right now? Why did I think that so confidently?” he wondered. He felt crushed and embarrassed. He could have laughed at himself in his anger. A dull rage boiled inside him. \n\nHe hesitated in the doorway. Going out to walk just for show felt disgusting, and going back to his room felt even worse. “What a chance I’ve lost forever!” he muttered, standing aimlessly in the doorway, right in front of the porter’s dark little room, which was also open. \n\nSuddenly, he noticed something shiny under the bench nearby. He looked around—no one was there. He tiptoed into the room, went down two steps, and quietly called the porter. “Yes, not home! But nearby, in the yard, because the door is wide open.” He rushed to the axe (it was an axe) and pulled it out from under the bench, where it was hidden between two pieces of wood. Before leaving, he secured it in a loop, put both hands in his pockets, and left the room; no one saw him! “When reason fails, the devil helps!” he thought with a strange grin. This lucky break made him feel much better. \n\nHe walked quietly and calmly, without rushing.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist experiences a mix of anxiety and exhilaration upon finding an axe that he believes will aid in executing his plan."
