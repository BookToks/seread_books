  "text": "**Crime and Punishment**  \n**Chapter IV**  \n\nAt that moment, the door quietly opened, and a young girl came into the room, looking shy. Everyone looked at her with surprise and curiosity. At first, Raskolnikov did not recognize her. It was Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov. He had seen her for the first time yesterday, but now she looked different in this setting and outfit. She was dressed simply and poorly, very young, almost like a child, with a modest and gentle way about her and a face that looked honest but a bit scared. She wore a plain indoor dress and an old-fashioned hat, but she still had a parasol. \n\nWhen she saw the room full of people, she felt more than embarrassed; she seemed completely overwhelmed with shyness, like a little child. She almost turned to leave. “Oh… it’s you!” Raskolnikov said, very surprised, and he felt confused too. He suddenly remembered that his mother and sister knew about “some young woman of bad reputation” from Luzhin’s letter. He had just been arguing against Luzhin’s lies and saying he had only seen the girl last night, and now she had walked in. He also recalled that he hadn’t objected to the term “of bad reputation.” All of this flashed through his mind quickly.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov enters the room, surprising Raskolnikov and evoking his confusion about her reputation."
