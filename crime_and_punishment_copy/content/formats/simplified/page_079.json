  "text": "He looked down on his friends, thinking he was better than them because of his knowledge and beliefs. \n\nWith Razumihin, he was more open and friendly. It was hard not to be close with Razumihin. He was very cheerful and honest, kind to the point of being simple, but there was a lot of depth and seriousness underneath that simplicity. His better friends understood this and liked him. He was smart, even if he acted a bit foolish sometimes. He looked striking—tall, thin, with black hair and often unshaven. He was loud and known for being very strong. One night, he knocked a huge policeman down with one punch. He could drink a lot, but he could also choose not to drink at all. Sometimes he went too far with his jokes, but he could also be serious. \n\nOne amazing thing about Razumihin was that nothing seemed to upset him. No bad situation could bring him down. He could live anywhere and handle being really cold and hungry. He was very poor and made a living from various jobs. He had many ways to earn money. One winter, he didn’t even use his stove and said he liked it better that way because he slept more soundly in the cold.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels superior to his peers, yet finds a more genuine connection with the good-natured and resilient Razumihin."
