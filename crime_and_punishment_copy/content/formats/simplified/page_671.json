  "text": "For the last three years, he has been unable to walk. The mother is a smart woman. They have a son who is away and doesn’t help, and a daughter who is married but doesn’t visit them. They also have two little nephews to take care of, and they took their youngest daughter out of school. She will be sixteen soon, and they want her to get married. She was meant for me. We went there, and it was funny! I showed up as a landowner, a widower with a good name, connections, and money. So what if I’m fifty and she’s not even sixteen? Who cares? It’s exciting, right? \n\nYou should have seen how I spoke to her parents. It was worth watching! She came in, curtsied, still in a short dress—a young girl! Blushing like a sunset—she must have been told to act that way. I think that at sixteen, with those innocent eyes, shyness, and tears of bashfulness, she’s better than just beautiful. She looks perfect, too. She has curly fair hair, rosy lips, tiny feet—adorable! \n\nWell, we got along well. I told them I was in a hurry because of family matters, and the next day, we got engaged. Now when I visit, I pick her up and hold her on my lap right away. She blushes like a sunset, and I kiss her all the time. Her mother tells her that I am her husband and that this is how it should be. It’s simply wonderful! Being engaged might even be better than being married.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The narrator describes his engagement to a much younger girl, finding the experience of betrothal more delightful than marriage itself."
