  "text": "Svidrigaïlov got up from the bed and went to the window. He opened it, and the strong wind hit his face and chest, which were only covered by his shirt, making him feel cold. \n\nHe walked through a long, narrow hallway looking for the sleepy attendant to pay for his room and leave the hotel. He thought, “This is the best moment; I couldn’t pick a better time.” \n\nAfter walking for a while without finding anyone, he was about to call out when he noticed something strange in a dark corner. He bent down with the candle and saw a little girl, about five years old, shivering and crying. Her clothes were soaked. She looked at him with wide, surprised eyes but didn’t seem scared. Occasionally, she sobbed like kids do when they’ve been crying for a long time but are starting to feel better. \n\nThe girl’s face was pale and tired; she was very cold. Svidrigaïlov wondered how she ended up there. She must have hidden and not slept all night. He started asking her questions. Suddenly, the girl perked up and began talking in her little voice about her “mammy” and how her “mammy would beat her” for breaking a cup. She kept talking without stopping. He guessed that she was a neglected child, probably from a hotel worker who was drunk and scared her. She had broken a cup and was so scared that she ran away the night before and hid for a long time.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov discovers a neglected, shivering little girl hiding in a dark corner of the hotel, revealing her fear of her mother and the harshness of her situation."
