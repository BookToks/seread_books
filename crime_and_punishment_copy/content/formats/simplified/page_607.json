Blood was still coming out, but she seemed to be waking up. Raskolnikov, Lebeziatnikov, and the official followed Sonia into the room, while the policeman pushed back the crowd that had followed them to the door. \n\nPolenka came in holding Kolya and Lida, who were scared and crying. Some people from the Kapernaumovs’ room also came in, including the landlord, a one-eyed man with a strange look and messy hair, his wife who always looked scared, and some curious children. Suddenly, Svidrigaïlov appeared. Raskolnikov was surprised to see him, not realizing he was in the crowd. They talked about getting a doctor and a priest. The official told Raskolnikov that it might be too late for the doctor, but he ordered one to be called. Kapernaumov went to get him.\n\nMeanwhile, Katerina Ivanovna started to breathe better. The bleeding stopped for a bit. She looked at Sonia with tired but sharp eyes. Sonia was pale and shaking, wiping sweat from her forehead with a handkerchief. Finally, Katerina asked to be lifted up. They helped her sit up on the bed. \n\n“Where are the children?” she asked weakly. “You brought them, Polenka? Oh, you silly kids! Why did you run?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna is carried to Sonia's room, where she regains consciousness and inquires about her children amidst a gathering crowd."
