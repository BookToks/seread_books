  "text": "We’ve talked about this before. I was happy to share my thoughts with you. You look very pale, Avdotya Romanovna.\n\n\"I know his theory. I read that article he wrote about people who think they can do anything. Razumihin brought it to me.\"\n\n\"Mr. Razumihin? Your brother’s article? In a magazine? I didn’t know there was such an article. It must be interesting. But where are you going, Avdotya Romanovna?\"\n\n\"I want to see Sofya Semyonovna,\" Dounia said quietly. \"How do I get to her? She might be back. I need to see her right away. Maybe she…\"\n\nAvdotya Romanovna couldn’t finish her sentence. She was out of breath.\n\n\"Sofya Semyonovna won’t be back until tonight. At least, I think so. She was supposed to come back right away, but if not, she’ll be gone for a long time.\"\n\n\"Ah, then you’re lying! I see… you’ve been lying… all this time. I don’t believe you! I don’t believe you!\" Dounia shouted, losing control.\n\nAlmost fainting, she sat down in a chair that Svidrigaïlov quickly offered her.\n\n\"Avdotya Romanovna, what’s wrong? Please calm down! Here’s some water. Drink a little…\"\n\nHe splashed some water on her. Dounia shivered and started to feel better.\n\n\"It had a strong effect,\" Svidrigaïlov said quietly, looking worried. \"Avdotya Romanovna, please calm down! Trust me, he has friends. We will help him. Would you like me to take him abroad? I have money; I can get a ticket in three days.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Avdotya Romanovna is distressed and desperate to see Sofya Semyonovna, believing she may have important news."
