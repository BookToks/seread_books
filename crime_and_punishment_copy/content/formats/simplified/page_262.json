  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nMarmeladov was hurt badly. He didn’t recognize Raskolnikov and looked around nervously. Katerina Ivanovna had a sad but serious face, and tears were falling from her eyes. \n\n“Oh my God! His whole chest is crushed! He’s bleeding so much!” she said in despair. “We need to take off his clothes. Turn a little, Semyon Zaharovitch, if you can,” she urged him. Marmeladov recognized her. \n\n“A priest,” he said in a weak voice. Katerina Ivanovna went to the window, rested her head against it, and cried out, “Oh, cursed life!” \n\n“A priest,” the dying man repeated after a moment. “They’ve gone for him,” Katerina Ivanovna shouted to him, and he became quiet. With sad and scared eyes, he looked for her. She came back and stood by his pillow. He seemed a bit better, but not for long.\n\nSoon, his eyes fell on little Lida, his favorite, who was shaking in the corner and staring at him with wide, confused eyes. He moved his hand toward her nervously. He wanted to say something. \n\n“What is it now?” Katerina Ivanovna asked. \n\n“Barefoot, barefoot!” he muttered, looking at the child’s bare feet with wild eyes. \n\n“Be quiet,” Katerina Ivanovna said sharply, “you know why she is barefoot.” \n\n“Thank God, the doctor,” Raskolnikov said, feeling relieved.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna is in despair over Marmeladov's severe injuries and the dire situation of their family."
