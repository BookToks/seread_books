  "text": "“Ah, is that what it is?” laughed Svidrigaïlov. “I would have been surprised if you let that go after everything that has happened. Ha-ha! I did catch on to some of the trouble you were causing and what you told Sofya Semyonovna about it. What was it all about? Maybe I’m just not up to date and don’t get it. Please, explain it to me, my dear boy. Share the latest ideas!”\n\n“You couldn’t have heard anything. You’re just making it up!” \n\n“But I’m not talking about that (even though I did hear something). I’m talking about how you keep sighing and groaning now. The Schiller in you is upset every moment, and now you tell me not to listen at doors. If that’s how you feel, go tell the police that you had a little accident: you made a mistake in your theory. But if you think you shouldn’t listen at doors but can murder old women whenever you want, you should just go to America and hurry. Run, young man! There might still be time. I’m being serious. Don’t you have the money? I’ll give you the fare.”\n\n“I’m not thinking about that at all,” Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust.\n\n“I understand (but don’t worry, don’t talk about it if you don’t want to). I get the moral questions you’re struggling with, right? Duties as a citizen and a person? Forget them all. They don’t matter to you now, ha-ha! You’ll say you’re still a man and a citizen. If that’s true, you shouldn’t have gotten into this mess. It’s pointless to think about it.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov mocks Raskolnikov's moral dilemmas and suggests he abandon his concerns about duty and ethics."
