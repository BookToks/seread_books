  "text": "I am a man because I make mistakes! You can’t find the truth without making a lot of errors. And that’s okay, but we can’t even make mistakes for ourselves! It’s better to mess up in your own way than to do things right in someone else’s way. If you do it your way, you’re a person; if you follow someone else, you’re like a bird. You won’t miss the truth, but life can be limited. There are examples of that. \n\nWhat are we doing now? In science, ideas, inventions, and everything else, we are still just learning the basics. We like to rely on other people’s ideas because that’s what we’re used to! Am I right? \n\n“Oh, I don’t know,” said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, feeling confused. \n\n“Yes, yes... even though I don’t agree with you on everything,” added Avdotya Romanovna seriously, and she cried out because he squeezed her hand too hard. \n\n“Yes, you say yes... after that, you...” he exclaimed excitedly, “you are full of goodness, purity, and perfection. Give me your hand... you give me yours too! I want to kiss your hands right here, on my knees...” and he dropped to his knees on the empty pavement. \n\n“Please stop, what are you doing?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna cried, very worried. \n\n“Get up, get up!” Dounia laughed, even though she was also concerned.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of making one's own mistakes as a path to truth and individuality, rather than conforming to others' ideas."
