  "text": "Razumihin was just talking about the Palais de Cristal. But what did I want? Oh yes, the newspapers. Zosimov said he read something in them. \"Do you have the papers?\" he asked as he entered a big, clean restaurant. It had several rooms, but they were mostly empty. A few people were drinking tea, and in another room, four men were drinking champagne. Raskolnikov thought one of them might be Zametov, but he wasn't sure from that distance. \"What if it is?\" he thought.\n\n\"Will you have vodka?\" the waiter asked.\n\n\"Just give me some tea and the old newspapers from the last five days, and I’ll give you a tip,\" Raskolnikov replied.\n\n\"Yes, sir, here’s today’s. No vodka?\"\n\nThe waiter brought the old newspapers and the tea. Raskolnikov sat down and started looking through them. \n\n\"Oh, damn... these are just announcements. An accident on a staircase, a shopkeeper spontaneously catching fire from alcohol, a fire in Peski... another fire in Petersburg... and another... Ah, here it is!\" \n\nHe finally found what he was looking for and began to read. The words seemed to dance in front of his eyes, but he read it all and eagerly searched for more updates in the following papers. His hands shook with nervous impatience as he flipped through the pages. Suddenly, someone sat down next to him. He looked up and saw it was Zametov, looking the same as before, with rings on his fingers and a watch-chain, and his curly, black hair neatly styled.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, in a restaurant, anxiously searches through old newspapers for specific news while observing the people around him."
