  "text": "Raskolnikov was still laughing and shaking hands with Porfiry Petrovitch. He wanted to stop laughing at the right time. Razumihin, feeling embarrassed after knocking over the table and breaking the glass, stared sadly at the mess. He cursed and turned to the window, looking out with a frown, not paying attention to anyone. Porfiry Petrovitch kept laughing but wanted to know what was going on. \n\nZametov, who had been sitting in the corner, stood up when the visitors came in. He smiled but looked surprised and a bit awkward at the scene. Raskolnikov didn’t like seeing Zametov there. \n\n“I need to think about this,” he thought. “Excuse me,” he said, pretending to be very embarrassed. “I’m Raskolnikov.” \n\n“Not at all, it’s nice to see you… and you came in so nicely… Why won’t he even say good morning?” Porfiry Petrovitch said, looking at Razumihin. \n\n“I really don’t know why he’s so mad at me. I just told him he was like Romeo and showed him why. That’s all!” \n\n“Pig!” Razumihin shouted without turning around. \n\n“There must be a good reason for his anger if he’s so upset about that,” Porfiry laughed. \n\n“Oh, you clever lawyer! … Forget you all!” Razumihin snapped, then suddenly started laughing too.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov and Razumihin navigate a humorous yet awkward social encounter with Porfiry Petrovitch and Zametov, highlighting their contrasting emotions."
