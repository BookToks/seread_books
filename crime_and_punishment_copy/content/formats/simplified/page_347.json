  "text": "Sonia was talking to someone and then noticed the man behind her. He quickly looked back at the house as he walked by, trying not to show he was interested. He slowed down, waiting for something. He wanted to know where Sonia was going home to.\n\nAs she turned a corner, he crossed the street to follow her. After a little while, he crossed back again and walked a few steps behind her.\n\nThe man was about fifty years old, tall and broad-shouldered, which made him look like he slouched a bit. He wore nice, stylish clothes and seemed like a well-off gentleman. He had a fancy cane that he tapped on the ground as he walked, and his gloves were very clean. His face was broad and pleasant, with high cheekbones and a healthy color that was rare in Petersburg. His light hair had some grey but was still thick, and his beard was even lighter. His blue eyes looked cold and thoughtful, and his lips were bright red. He looked very well-kept and younger than he really was.\n\nWhen Sonia reached the canal bank, they were the only two people on the sidewalk. He noticed that she seemed lost in thought. When she got to the house where she lived, she went through the gate, and he followed her.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A mysterious man observes Sonia as she walks home, intrigued by her demeanor and intent on discovering more about her."
