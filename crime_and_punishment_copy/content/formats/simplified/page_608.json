  "text": "Once again, her dry lips were covered in blood. She looked around with her eyes. \n\n\"So this is how you live, Sonia! I've never been in your room before.\" \n\nShe looked at Sonia with a pained expression. \n\n\"We have ruined you, Sonia. Polenka, Lida, Kolya, come here! Here they are, Sonia, take them all! I'm done! The fun is over.\" (Cough!) \"Lay me down, let me die in peace.\" \n\nThey helped her lie back on the pillow. \n\n\"What about the priest? I don’t want him. You don’t have any money to spare. I have no sins. God can forgive me without that. He knows how much I’ve suffered... And if He won’t forgive me, I don’t care!\" \n\nShe slipped deeper into a restless state. Sometimes she shivered and looked around, recognizing everyone for a moment, but then she would fall back into confusion. Her breathing was rough and hard, and there was a rattling sound in her throat. \n\n\"I told him, your excellency,\" she gasped after each word. \"That Amalia Ludwigovna, ah! Lida, Kolya, hurry up! Do it gracefully! Tap your heels, be a graceful child! \n\n'You have diamonds and pearls. \n\nWhat’s next? That’s the song to sing. \n\n'You have the most beautiful eyes, girl, what more do you want?' \n\nWhat an idea! What more do you want? What silly things!\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna, in a state of delirium and suffering, expresses her despair and resignation while entrusting her children to Sonia."
