  "text": "Zossimov was a tall, heavy man with a round, pale face and straight, light-colored hair. He wore glasses and a big gold ring on his thick finger. He was twenty-seven years old. He had on a light gray coat and loose summer pants, and everything about him was neat and stylish. His clothes were clean, and he had a big watch chain. He acted slow and relaxed but tried hard to seem casual. Even though he tried not to show it, he came off as a bit full of himself. His friends found him boring, but they said he was good at his job.\n\n\"I've come to see you twice today, brother. Look, he’s awake,\" Razumihin said excitedly.\n\n\"I see, I see; how are we feeling now?\" Zossimov asked Raskolnikov, watching him closely. He sat down at the end of the sofa and tried to get comfortable.\n\n\"He's still feeling down,\" Razumihin continued. \"We just changed his sheets, and he almost cried.\"\n\n\"That's normal; you could have waited if he didn't want it. His pulse is great. Does your head still hurt?\" \n\n\"I’m fine, I’m perfectly fine!\" Raskolnikov said firmly and a bit angrily. He sat up on the sofa.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Zossimov, a doctor, observes Raskolnikov's recovery while noting his continued depression and irritability."
