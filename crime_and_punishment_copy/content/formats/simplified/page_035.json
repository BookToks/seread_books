He looked at Raskolnikov with a sly smile and said, “This morning I went to see Sonia to ask her for some money! He-he-he!”\n\n“You don’t mean she gave you money?” shouted one of the newcomers, laughing loudly.\n\n“This very drink was bought with her money,” Marmeladov said, looking only at Raskolnikov. “She gave me thirty copecks, her last money, as I saw. She didn’t say anything, just looked at me silently. Up there, they care about people and cry for them, but they don’t blame them. But it hurts more when they don’t blame! Thirty copecks, yes! Maybe she needs that money now, right? What do you think, sir? She has to look good. It costs money to be smart, you know? Do you understand? And she needs things like pomade, petticoats, and nice shoes to show off her foot when she steps over a puddle. Do you get what all that means? And here I am, her own father, taking thirty copecks of her money for a drink! And I’m drinking it! Who will feel sorry for a man like me, huh? Do you feel sorry for me, sir, or not?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marmeladov expresses his despair over his alcoholism and the guilt of taking money from his daughter Sonia, highlighting the pain of his situation."
