Tell me, Porfiry Petrovitch, just tell me quickly!”\n\nPorfiry smiled slyly and said, “What a situation we have here! Why do you want to know so badly, especially since no one is bothering you? You’re like a child asking for matches! Why are you so nervous? Why are you pushing yourself on us, huh? He-he-he!”\n\nRaskolnikov shouted angrily, “I can’t stand this!”\n\n“What can’t you stand? The uncertainty?” Porfiry interrupted.\n\n“Don’t mock me! I won’t accept it! I can’t and I won’t, do you hear?” he yelled, hitting the table with his fist.\n\n“Shh! They’ll hear us! Seriously, be careful. I’m not joking,” Porfiry whispered, but this time he looked serious and stern, showing no kindness.\n\nFor a moment, Raskolnikov was confused and suddenly became very angry, but strangely, he still spoke quietly even though he was furious.\n\n“I won’t let you torture me,” he whispered, feeling hatred because he knew he had to obey and this made him even angrier. “Arrest me, search me, but please do it properly.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov demands clarity from Porfiry about his innocence while struggling with intense anxiety and fury over the uncertainty of his situation."
