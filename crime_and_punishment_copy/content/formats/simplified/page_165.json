  "text": "\"Good-bye,\" he said quickly and walked to the door.\n\n\"Wait, wait! You're so strange.\"\n\n\"I don’t want to,\" the other person said, pulling his hand away again.\n\n\"Then why did you come here? Are you crazy or something? This is... almost rude! I won’t let you leave like that.\"\n\n\"Well, I came to you because I don’t know anyone else who could help... to start... because you are nicer than anyone— smarter, I mean, and can understand... and now I see that I don’t want anything. Do you hear? Nothing at all... no one’s help... no one’s kindness. I am by myself... alone. Come on, that’s enough. Leave me alone.\"\n\n\"Stay a minute, you fool! You’re acting like a madman. Do what you want, I don’t care. I have no lessons to teach, and I’m fine with that. But there’s a bookseller, Heruvimov— he’s like a lesson for me. I wouldn’t trade him for five lessons. He’s publishing some books and they are selling well! Even the titles are worth the money! You always said I was dumb, but believe me, there are bigger fools than I am! Now he wants to act smart, even though he doesn’t know anything, but I encourage him. Here are two parts of a German text— in my opinion, it’s really silly; it asks, ‘Is a woman a human being?’ And it proudly proves that she is. Heruvimov is going to publish this work about women; I’m translating it, and he will add more to these two and a half parts.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The conversation reveals a sense of isolation and a rejection of help, highlighting the protagonist's internal struggle and desire for independence."
