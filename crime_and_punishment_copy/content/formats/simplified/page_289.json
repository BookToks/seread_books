I don’t deserve to love you, but every man who isn’t a total beast should show you respect! And I’ve shown you respect. Here are your rooms, and for that alone, Rodya was right to send your Pyotr Petrovitch away. How dare he! How dare he put you in such a place! It’s a scandal! Do you know what kind of people stay here? And you’re his fiancée! You are his fiancée? Yes? Well, then, I’ll tell you, your fiancé is a scoundrel.”\n\n“Excuse me, Mr. Razumihin, you’re forgetting…” Pulcheria Alexandrovna started.\n\n“Yes, yes, you’re right, I lost my temper, and I’m sorry,” Razumihin quickly apologized. “But you can’t be mad at me for saying this! I’m being honest, not because… um, um! That would be shameful; actually, not because I’m in… um! Well, I won’t say why, I can’t… But we all saw today when he came in that he is not like us. Not because he had his hair done at the barber, not because he rushed to show off, but because he is a spy, a schemer, a cheapskate, and a fool. That’s clear. Do you think he’s smart? No, he’s a fool, a fool. And is he good enough for you? Good heavens! Do you see, ladies?” He suddenly stopped on the way upstairs to their rooms. “Even though all my friends are drunk, they are all honest. And even if we talk a lot of nonsense, and I do too, we will talk our way to the truth.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin expresses his disdain for Pulcheria's fiancé, calling him a scoundrel and emphasizing the importance of honesty among friends."
