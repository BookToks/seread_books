He believed that having a smart and charming woman by his side could really help him. But now everything was falling apart! This sudden change hit him hard; it felt like a bad joke. He had only been a little bossy, made a joke, and it had turned serious so quickly. He did care for Dounia in his own way and dreamt of being with her, but now it was all gone! He needed to fix things the next day, make everything better, and especially deal with that annoying guy who caused all this.
