It was like saying, \"Let's go and try it instead of just dreaming about it!\" But he quickly broke down and ran away, angry with himself. \n\nAs for the moral side of things, he thought he had figured it all out. His reasoning was sharp, and he couldn’t find any good excuses in himself. But in the end, he stopped believing in himself and desperately searched for reasons, as if someone was pushing him toward it.\n\nBefore this, he had been thinking a lot about one question: why are most crimes so poorly hidden and easy to catch? He came to many interesting conclusions. He believed the main reason was not just that it’s hard to hide a crime, but also because of the criminal themselves. \n\nMost criminals lose their will and ability to think clearly at the moment when they need to be careful the most. He thought this loss of reason was like a sickness that gradually grew stronger, peaked right before the crime, and lasted for a while afterward, depending on the person, before fading away like any other illness.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist grapples with the moral implications of crime, concluding that criminals often fail due to a temporary loss of will and reasoning, akin to a disease."
