  "text": "I’m worried that your anger might stay with you for a long time. That’s what scares me. I don’t judge you for cutting yourself off from us, and I’m sorry for blaming you. I understand that if I had a big problem, I would want to be alone too. I won’t tell Mom about this, but I will talk about you a lot and tell her you will come soon. Don’t worry about her; I will help her feel better. But please don’t keep her waiting too long—come at least once; she is your mother. \n\nI just wanted to say that if you ever need me or anything, just call, and I will come. Goodbye! \n\nShe quickly turned and walked toward the door. \n\n“Dounia!” Raskolnikov called her back. “That Razumihin, Dmitri Prokofitch, is a really good guy.” \n\nDounia blushed a little. “Well?” she asked, waiting. \n\n“He is smart, hardworking, honest, and capable of real love… Goodbye, Dounia.” \n\nDounia turned red and then looked worried. “What do you mean, brother? Are we really saying goodbye forever with such a message?” \n\n“Don’t worry about it… Goodbye.” \n\nHe turned away and walked to the window. She stood there for a moment, looking at him with concern, and then left feeling uneasy. \n\nHe wasn’t cold to her. For a brief moment, he wanted to hug her and say goodbye properly, but he didn’t dare.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses concern for his sister Dounia's well-being while contemplating his own isolation and the impact of his troubles on those he loves."
