  "text": "Pulcheria Alexandrovna wondered who would make the other more unhappy—him or her. She then nervously asked him about what happened the day before with Luzhin, often looking at Dounia, which clearly annoyed her. This situation seemed to worry her a lot, even more than everything else. Razumihin explained it again, but this time he said he thought Raskolnikov meant to insult Pyotr Petrovitch on purpose, and he didn’t try to excuse him because of his illness.\n\n\"He planned it before he got sick,\" he added.\n\n\"I think so too,\" Pulcheria Alexandrovna said sadly. But she was surprised to hear Razumihin speak so carefully and even respectfully about Pyotr Petrovitch. Dounia was also taken aback.\n\n\"So, this is what you think of Pyotr Petrovitch?\" Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked.\n\n\"I can’t think any differently about your daughter's future husband,\" Razumihin replied firmly and kindly. \"I don’t say this just to be polite, but because Avdotya Romanovna chose to be with him. If I spoke badly about him last night, it was because I was really drunk and… crazy; yes, crazy, I lost my mind completely… and I’m ashamed of it this morning.\"\n\nHe turned red and stopped talking. Avdotya Romanovna blushed too but didn’t say anything.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pulcheria Alexandrovna expresses her concern about the potential misery between her daughter Dounia and her fiancé Pyotr Petrovitch, while Razumihin reflects on Raskolnikov's intentional insult towards him."
