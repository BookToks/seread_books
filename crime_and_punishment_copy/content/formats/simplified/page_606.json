Raskolnikov and Lebeziatnikov were the first to reach her, followed by the official and the policeman, who sighed and said, \"Great, this is going to be a hassle.\" \n\n\"Move along! Move along!\" he told the crowd that was pushing forward. \n\n\"She’s dying,\" someone shouted. \n\n\"She’s lost her mind,\" said another. \n\n\"Lord, help us,\" a woman said, making the sign of the cross. \"Have they caught the little girl and boy? They’re being brought back; the older one has them... Oh, those naughty kids!\" \n\nWhen they looked closely at Katerina Ivanovna, they realized she hadn’t hurt herself on a stone like Sonia thought. The blood on the ground was coming from her chest. \n\n\"I’ve seen this before,\" the official said to Raskolnikov and Lebeziatnikov. \"That’s consumption; the blood comes out and chokes the person. I saw this happen to a family member not long ago... nearly a pint of blood all at once... What can we do? She is dying.\" \n\n\"This way, this way, to my room!\" Sonia pleaded. \"I live here! That house, the second one from here... Come to me, hurry,\" she said to everyone. \"Send for the doctor! Oh no!\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna collapses and bleeds, prompting a frantic response from those around her as they realize she is gravely ill."
