  "text": "Lebeziatnikov looked worried. \n\n“I came to see you, Sofya Semyonovna,” he started. “Sorry… I thought I would find you,” he said suddenly looking at Raskolnikov. “I didn’t mean anything bad… But I just thought… Katerina Ivanovna has lost her mind,” he suddenly said, turning back to Sonia. \n\nSonia screamed. \n\n“At least it seems that way. But… we don’t know what to do! She came back—she seems to have been thrown out somewhere, maybe beaten… That’s what it looks like at least. She went to your father’s old boss, but he wasn’t home; he was eating with another general. Just imagine, she ran over to the other general’s place, and she was so determined that she got the boss to see her, even pulled him away from dinner. You can guess what happened next. Of course, she was thrown out! But according to her story, she yelled at him and threw something at him. It’s hard to believe she wasn’t arrested! Now she’s telling everyone, even Amalia Ivanovna, but it’s hard to understand her because she’s screaming and acting crazy. Oh yes, she’s shouting that since everyone has left her, she will take the children and go out into the street with a barrel-organ.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna is in a state of distress, having been turned away from a general's dinner and threatening to take her children to the streets."
