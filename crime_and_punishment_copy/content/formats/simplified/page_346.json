When I learned it, I asked, ‘Where does Mr. Raskolnikov live?’ I didn’t know you only had a room, too. Goodbye, I’ll tell Katerina Ivanovna.”  \n\nShe was very happy to leave. She looked down and hurried away to get out of sight. She walked quickly to the corner on the right to be alone. As she walked fast, she didn’t look at anyone or notice anything. She wanted to think and remember every word and detail. She had never felt anything like this before. A whole new world was opening up for her. She suddenly remembered that Raskolnikov planned to visit her that day, maybe right away!  \n\n“Not today, please, not today!” she kept saying to herself, feeling anxious, like a scared child. “Please! Not in that room… he will see… oh no!”  \n\nAt that moment, she didn’t notice a stranger watching her and following her. He had come with her from the gate. When Razumihin, Raskolnikov, and she stopped to say goodbye on the sidewalk, the stranger heard Sonia say, “I asked where Mr. Raskolnikov lived?” He quickly looked at all three of them, especially at Raskolnikov.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia feels a mix of anxiety and anticipation as she reflects on her encounter with Raskolnikov, sensing a new world opening before her."
