  "text": "The policeman looked confused and stared at Raskolnikov with wide eyes. Raskolnikov laughed.\n\n“Wow!” the policeman said with a dismissive hand gesture, then followed the dandy and the girl, probably thinking Raskolnikov was crazy or something worse.\n\n“He's taken my twenty copecks,” Raskolnikov muttered angrily when he was alone. “Let him take as much from the other guy to keep the girl. Why did I even try to help? Do I have the right to help? Let them hurt each other—why do I care? How could I give him twenty copecks? Were they even mine?”\n\nEven with those strange thoughts, he felt very unhappy. He sat down on an empty bench. His mind was all over the place. He wished he could forget everything and then wake up to start over.\n\n“Poor girl!” he said, looking at the empty spot where she had been. “She’ll come to her senses and cry, and then her mother will find out. She’ll probably hit her, a terrible, shameful beating, and then maybe kick her out. Even if she doesn’t, the Darya Frantsovnas will hear about it, and soon the girl will be sneaking around. Then she’ll end up in the hospital (that always happens to girls with decent mothers who go astray) and then... back to the hospital... drinking... the bars... and more hospital visits.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reflects on the tragic fate of a girl he feels powerless to help, contemplating the cycle of despair that ensnares her."
