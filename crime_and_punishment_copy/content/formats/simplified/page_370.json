The second group breaks the law; they cause destruction or want to destroy things based on their abilities. The crimes of these people are different and often they want to destroy the current situation for something better. But if someone feels they need to step over a dead body or go through blood for their idea, they can find a way to justify it in their own mind, depending on the importance of their idea. That's what I mean when I talk about their right to commit crimes in my article (which started with a legal question). \n\nHowever, there's no need to worry; most people will not accept this right. They punish these criminals or execute them, and this is a fair way to protect society. But later, the same people might idolize these criminals and admire them. The first group represents the present, while the second group represents the future. The first group keeps the world as it is, while the second group pushes the world toward its goals. Both groups have the right to exist. In fact, everyone has equal rights, and let there be a never-ending struggle until a better future comes! \n\n“Do you believe in a better future?” \n\n“I do,” Raskolnikov said firmly, keeping his eyes fixed on one spot on the carpet as he spoke.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The text discusses the distinction between two categories of individuals: those who uphold the law and those who transgress it for the sake of a greater idea, suggesting that both have a right to exist and contribute to societal progress."
