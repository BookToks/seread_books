Her face is like a painting of the Madonna by Raphael. You know, the Sistine Madonna has a special look of sad religious joy. Have you noticed that? Well, she has something like that. \n\nThe day after we got engaged, I bought her gifts worth fifteen hundred roubles—a set of diamonds, a set of pearls, and a big silver dressing case filled with all sorts of things, which made her look even more beautiful. Yesterday, I sat her on my knee, maybe a bit too casually—she turned red and almost cried, but she tried not to show it. \n\nWhen we were alone, she suddenly hugged me (for the first time on her own), wrapped her little arms around me, kissed me, and promised to be a good wife. She said she would make me happy and give her whole life to me. All she wants in return is my respect and nothing else, not even gifts. \n\nYou have to admit, hearing such sweet words from a sixteen-year-old girl in a pretty dress, with cute curls, shy cheeks, and tears of joy in her eyes is really charming! Isn’t it? It’s worth celebrating, right? Well… let’s go see my fiancée, but not right now! \n\nThe big age difference makes you feel excited! Are you really going to go through with this marriage?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The speaker describes his betrothed, a young girl who expresses her devotion and desire for respect, highlighting the fascination of their relationship despite the significant age difference."
