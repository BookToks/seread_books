  "text": "A month ago, even yesterday, the thought was just a dream. But now, it felt real and scary, and he realized this. He felt a pounding in his head and saw darkness in front of his eyes.\n\nHe looked around quickly, searching for something. He wanted to sit down and was looking for a seat. He was walking along K—— Boulevard. There was a seat about a hundred steps ahead of him. He hurried towards it, but on the way, he noticed something that caught all his attention. \n\nHe saw a woman about twenty steps in front of him. At first, he didn’t pay much attention to her, just like he usually didn’t notice the path he was walking on. But there was something very odd about this woman that made him focus on her, first reluctantly and then more and more. He suddenly wanted to know what was strange about her.\n\nShe looked quite young and was walking in the heat without a hat or gloves, waving her arms around in a silly way. She wore a light silky dress that was put on in a strange way, not fastened properly, and torn at the top near her waist, with a big piece hanging loose. A small scarf was draped around her neck but was slanted.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov becomes increasingly aware of his surroundings and the strange behavior of a young woman he encounters while searching for a seat."
