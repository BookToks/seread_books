  "text": "Dounia could be called really beautiful. Her hair was dark brown, a bit lighter than her brother's. Her almost black eyes had a proud shine, but sometimes showed great kindness. She was pale, but it was a healthy kind of pale; her face looked fresh and full of energy. Her mouth was small, and her full red lower lip stuck out a bit, along with her chin. This was the only flaw in her beautiful face, but it gave her a unique and almost proud look. \n\nHer face was usually more serious and thoughtful than happy, but when she smiled or laughed, it suited her perfectly. It made sense that a warm and honest guy like Razumihin, who had never seen anyone like her and was a bit drunk, would instantly fall for her. He first saw Dounia looking joyful and full of love for her brother. Later, he noticed her lower lip tremble with anger at her brother's rude and ungrateful words, and that sealed his feelings for her.\n\nHe was right when he drunkenly said on the stairs that Praskovya Pavlovna, Raskolnikovâ€™s strange landlady, would be jealous of Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Dounia because of him. Even though Pulcheria Alexandrovna was forty-three, she still looked younger than her age. This is often true for women who stay calm, sensitive, and warm-hearted as they get older.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia is portrayed as a beautiful and strong character, whose complex emotions and relationships, particularly with her brother and Razumihin, reveal her depth and individuality."
