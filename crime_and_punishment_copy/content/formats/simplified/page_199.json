  "text": "I gave him two roubles for them. When I asked him where he found them, he said he picked them up in the street. I didn’t ask him anything else. This is Dushkin’s story.\n\nI gave him a note, which was a rouble, because I thought if he didn’t pawn it with me, he would with someone else. It would be the same thing—he’d spend it on alcohol, so it was better for me to keep it. The more you hide it, the faster you’ll find it. If I hear any rumors, I’ll take it to the police. Of course, that’s all nonsense; he’s lying because I know Dushkin. He’s a pawnbroker and deals in stolen goods, and he didn’t cheat Nikolay out of a thirty-rouble item just to give it to the police. He was just scared. \n\nBut back to Dushkin’s story. I’ve known this peasant, Nikolay Dementyev, since we were kids; we come from the same place. Although Nikolay isn’t a heavy drinker, he does drink, and I knew he had a job painting in that house with Dmitri, who is also from our village. As soon as he got the rouble, he changed it, had a few drinks, took his change, and left. But I didn’t see Dmitri with him then. \n\nThe next day, I heard that someone had murdered Alyona Ivanovna and her sister, Lizaveta Ivanovna, with an axe. I knew them, and I immediately thought about the earrings because I knew the murdered woman lent money on items. I went to the house and started asking questions without telling anyone. First, I asked, “Is Nikolay here?” Dmitri told me that Nikolay had gone off drinking; he came home drunk at daybreak.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dushkin, a pawnbroker, recounts his suspicions regarding Nikolay, a painter, after hearing about the murder of Alyona and Lizaveta Ivanovna."
