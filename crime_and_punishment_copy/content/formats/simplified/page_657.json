But I’m not anything special, and sometimes I feel really bored. I thought you might share something interesting.\n\n“What are you, and why are you here?”  \n“What am I? I’m a gentleman. I served in the cavalry for two years, then I wandered around Petersburg, and then I married Marfa Petrovna and lived in the country.
