She looked at Raskolnikov's messy room and said, \"You gave us everything yesterday.\" She felt embarrassed and looked down again. Her lips and chin were shaking. She was surprised by Raskolnikov's poor living situation, and her words just came out. \n\nThere was a moment of silence. Dounia's eyes lit up, and even Pulcheria Alexandrovna smiled kindly at Sonia. \n\n\"Rodya,\" she said as she stood up, \"we'll have dinner together, right? Come on, Dounia. And Rodya, you should take a short walk and rest before you visit us. I'm worried we’ve tired you out.\" \n\n\"Yes, yes, I'll come,\" he said, getting up in a hurry. \"But I have something to do first.\" \n\n\"But you will have dinner with us, right?\" asked Razumihin, surprised at Raskolnikov's answer. \"What do you mean?\" \n\n\"Yes, yes, I'm coming... of course! And you stay for a minute. You don’t need him right now, do you, mother? Or am I taking him away from you?\" \n\n\"Oh, no, no. Dmitri Prokofitch, will you please join us for dinner?\" \n\n\"Please do,\" Dounia added. \n\nRazumihin smiled brightly and bowed.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia expresses gratitude for Raskolnikov's help, highlighting the emotional connections and tensions among the characters."
