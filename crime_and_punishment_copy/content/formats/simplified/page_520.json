You misunderstand the word development in a very simple way! Good heavens, how … crude you still are! We are working for women’s freedom and you only have one idea in your head. Setting aside the general idea of chastity and modesty as useless beliefs, I respect her choices about her own modesty. If she were to tell me she wanted me, I would feel very lucky because I like her a lot; but as it is, no one has treated her with more respect than I have. I just wait and hope, that’s all!’\n\n‘You should give her a gift. I bet you never thought of that.’\n\n‘You don’t understand, as I’ve said before! Yes, she is in a tough spot, but that’s a different issue. You look down on her. You see something you think is worthy of scorn, and you refuse to see her as a human being. You don’t know what kind of person she is! I just wish she hadn’t stopped reading and borrowing books lately. I used to lend her some. I also wish that even with all her energy and courage to protest—which she has shown before—she had more confidence and independence to break free from certain old beliefs and silly ideas. But she really understands some things well.’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The conversation reveals a character's belief in the importance of women's freedom and dignity, while critiquing societal prejudices against them."
