  "text": "Sonia remembered how scared Lizaveta looked when he came at her with the axe. Lizaveta stepped back against the wall, holding out her hand in fear, just like little kids do when they get scared. Sonia felt the same way. She looked at him with fear and then slowly reached out her left hand to touch his chest. She started to get up from the bed, moving away from him while keeping her eyes on him.\n\nHis fear matched hers. He stared at her with the same scared expression and a weak smile. \n\n“Have you guessed?” he whispered finally.\n\n“Oh my God!” she cried out in despair. She fell back onto the bed, burying her face in the pillows. But then she quickly got up, rushed to him, grabbed his hands tightly, and looked into his face with the same intense gaze. In that moment, she tried to find some hope in him. But there was none; it was all true. Later, when she thought back to that moment, she found it strange that she knew it was true right away. She couldn’t say why she felt that way—it was as if she had somehow expected this.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia experiences a profound and paralyzing fear as she confronts the truth of Raskolnikov's actions."
