  "text": "Raskolnikov was talking when someone addressed him. \n\n“If you’re feeling okay, I have thirty-five roubles for you. Semyon Semyonovitch got this from Afanasy Ivanovitch because your mom asked for it, just like before. Do you know him?” \n\n“Yes, I remember Vahrushin,” Raskolnikov replied slowly. \n\n“See, he knows Vahrushin!” Razumihin exclaimed. “He’s in a good state! And I can tell you’re smart too. It’s nice to hear wise words.” \n\n“That’s right, Vahrushin, Afanasy Ivanovitch. Your mom sent money before the same way, and he agreed to send it again. He told Semyon Semyonovitch a few days ago to give you thirty-five roubles, hoping for better times ahead.” \n\n“‘Hoping for better times ahead’ is the best thing you’ve said. But ‘your mom’ isn’t bad either. So, what do you say? Is he fully aware?” \n\n“That’s fine. If he can just sign this small paper.” \n\n“He can write his name. Do you have the book?” \n\n“Yes, here’s the book.” \n\n“Give it to me. Here, Rodya, sit up. I’ll help you. Take the pen and write ‘Raskolnikov’ for him. Right now, brother, money is more important to us than anything.” \n\n“I don’t want it,” Raskolnikov said, pushing the pen away. \n\n“Don’t want it?” \n\n“I won’t sign it.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov refuses to sign for a remittance of thirty-five roubles sent by his mother, indicating his disconnection from his circumstances."
