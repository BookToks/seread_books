All they needed to do was take the injured man to the police station and the hospital. No one knew his name.\n\nMeanwhile, Raskolnikov pushed through the crowd and leaned closer to the man.

I know him!” he shouted, moving to the front. “It’s a retired government clerk, Marmeladov. He lives nearby in Kozel’s house. Hurry and get a doctor! I will pay, look!” He took out money from his pocket and showed it to the policeman. He was very anxious.  \n\nThe police were happy to find out who the man was. Raskolnikov gave his name and address, and, as if it were his own father, he urgently asked the police to take the unconscious Marmeladov to his home right away.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov recognizes the injured man, Marmeladov, and urgently insists on getting him medical help while offering to pay for it."
