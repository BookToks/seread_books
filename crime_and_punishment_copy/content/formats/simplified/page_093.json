  "text": "It happened to him many times to go home without noticing which streets he walked through. But he kept asking himself, why did such an important and random meeting happen in the Hay Market? It was at the exact time in his life when that meeting could change everything for him. It was as if it was waiting for him on purpose!\n\nIt was around nine o’clock when he crossed the Hay Market. The market people were closing their stalls and packing up their things, just like their customers who were heading home. Rag pickers and sellers were crowding around the bars in the dirty courtyards of the Hay Market. Raskolnikov liked this place and the nearby alleys when he wandered the streets. Here, his old clothes didn’t get him any nasty looks, and he could walk around in any outfit without shocking anyone.\n\nAt the corner of an alley, a seller and his wife had two tables with tapes, thread, cotton handkerchiefs, and more. They were getting ready to go home but were chatting with a friend who had just arrived. This friend was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or just Lizaveta, the younger sister of the old pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna, whom Raskolnikov had visited the day before to pawn his watch and test his idea.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reflects on the significance of a chance meeting in the Hay Market that could profoundly impact his destiny."
