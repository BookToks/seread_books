  "text": "I can see that you have some worries on your mind. When you came in, I noticed it, which is why I started talking to you. I want to share my life story, but I don’t want to look silly in front of people who already know it. I’m hoping to find someone who understands and is educated.\n\nMy wife went to a fancy school for girls from rich families. After she graduated, she performed a dance for important people and got a gold medal and a certificate of merit. The medal was sold a long time ago, but she still keeps the certificate in her trunk. Recently, she showed it to our landlady. Even though they often argue, she wanted to share her past achievements and happy memories. I don’t blame her for this; it’s all she has left since everything else is gone. \n\nYes, she is a strong and proud woman. She cleans the floors herself and only eats black bread, but she won’t let anyone disrespect her. That’s why she couldn’t ignore Mr. Lebeziatnikov’s rudeness. When he hit her, she was more hurt by his words than the physical pain. She was a widow when I married her and had three kids, each younger than the last. She married her first husband, an army officer, because she loved him and ran away with him from her father’s house. She loved him a lot, but he got into gambling, got into trouble, and eventually died. He used to hit her.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The narrator reflects on his wife's proud past and current struggles, highlighting her resilience despite her hardships."
