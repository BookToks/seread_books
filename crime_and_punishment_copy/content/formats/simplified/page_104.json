  "text": "He found an old, dirty shirt among the linen. He tore a long strip from it, about two inches wide and sixteen inches long. He folded the strip in half, took off his strong summer coat, which was his only outer garment, and started sewing the ends of the rag inside the coat, under the left armhole. His hands shook while he sewed, but he did it well, so nothing showed when he put the coat back on.\n\nHe had prepared a needle and thread earlier, and they were on his table wrapped in paper. He also made a clever noose for the axe. He couldn’t carry the axe in his hands on the street. If he hid it under his coat, he would still need to hold it with his hand, which would be obvious. Now, he could just put the axe head in the noose, and it would hang quietly under his arm. By putting his hand in his coat pocket, he could hold the end of the handle, so it wouldn’t swing. His coat was big, like a sack, so no one would see that he was holding something with the hand in his pocket. He had come up with this noose two weeks earlier.\n\nAfter he finished, he reached into a small space between his sofa and the floor, felt around in the left corner, and pulled out a pledge he had hidden there. This pledge was just a smooth piece of wood, the size and thickness of a silver cigarette case. He found this piece of wood while wandering in a courtyard.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist ingeniously prepares to conceal an axe under his coat using a noose he designed, demonstrating his troubled state of mind and intentions."
