  "text": "Sonia might have been hurt by her situation, but her spirit was strong. She couldn't be scared or broken down. Sonia had a good reason to say that Katerina Ivanovna was a bit out of her mind. She wasn't crazy, but for a year, she had been under so much stress that it affected her thinking. Doctors say that severe illness can impact the mind.\n\nThere weren't many kinds of wine, and there was no Madeira, but there was some wine. There was also vodka, rum, and cheap Lisbon wine, all in enough quantity. Besides the usual rice and honey, there were three or four dishes, including pancakes, all made in Amalia Ivanovna's kitchen. Two samovars were boiling to serve tea and punch after dinner. \n\nKaterina Ivanovna had bought the food herself with help from a lodger, a poor little Pole who had ended up at Madame Lippevchsel’s place. He was eager to help Katerina Ivanovna and spent the whole morning and the day before running around as fast as he could, wanting everyone to notice. He would rush to her for every little thing, even finding her at the market, and always called her ‘Pani.’ By the end, she was really tired of him, even though she had said at first that she couldn’t have managed without this ‘helpful and generous man.’ Katerina Ivanovna often described everyone she met in very flattering terms. Her compliments were so over-the-top that it was hard to believe.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna, despite her mental strain and difficult circumstances, organizes a dinner to honor the memory of her deceased husband, showcasing her determination and social aspirations."
