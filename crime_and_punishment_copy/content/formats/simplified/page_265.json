  "text": "Sonia stopped in the doorway, looking around confused and unaware of everything. She forgot about her fancy, old silk dress that looked out of place here, her big crinoline that blocked the doorway, her light shoes, and the parasol she had brought even though it was useless at night. She also forgot about her silly round straw hat with a bright feather. Under the tilted hat was her pale, scared face with open lips and wide, terrified eyes. Sonia was a small, thin girl of eighteen with fair hair. She was pretty, with beautiful blue eyes. She stared at the bed and the priest, catching her breath after running. Finally, she heard whispers from the crowd and stepped closer into the room, still near the door.\n\nThe service was over. Katerina Ivanovna went back to her husband. The priest stepped back and said a few comforting words to her as he was leaving. \n\n“What am I supposed to do with these?” she interrupted sharply, pointing to the little kids. \n\n“God is merciful; look to Him for help,” the priest began.\n\n“Oh! He is merciful, but not to us,” Katerina Ivanovna replied.\n\n“That’s a sin, madam,” the priest said, shaking his head.\n\n“And isn’t that a sin?” Katerina Ivanovna shouted, pointing at the dying man.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia, a frightened young girl, enters a room filled with tension as Katerina Ivanovna confronts a priest about her family's suffering and the dying man's fate."
