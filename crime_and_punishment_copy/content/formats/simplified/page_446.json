  "text": "Raskolnikov went straight to the house by the canal where Sonia lived. It was an old green building with three floors. He spoke to the porter and got some unclear directions to find Kapernaumov, the tailor. He found the entrance to a dark and narrow staircase in the corner of the courtyard, climbed to the second floor, and stepped out onto a hallway that went around the whole floor.\n\nAs he walked in the darkness, unsure of where to find Kapernaumov’s door, a door opened nearby. He automatically grabbed the handle. \n\n“Who is there?” a woman’s voice asked nervously. \n\n“It’s me… I came to see you,” Raskolnikov replied and entered the small entryway. \n\nOn a broken chair, there was a candle in an old copper holder. \n\n“It’s you! Good heavens!” Sonia exclaimed weakly, standing frozen in shock. \n\n“Which is your room? This way?” Raskolnikov asked, trying not to look at her, and hurried inside. \n\nA minute later, Sonia came in with the candle, put down the candlestick, and stood in front of him, very nervous and clearly scared by his unexpected visit. Her face suddenly turned red.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov visits Sonia at her home, finding her surprised and agitated by his unexpected arrival."
