Everything else is in God’s hands, but I have some questions to ask you... so we will meet again, right?” Porfiry smiled at him.\n\n“Right?” he repeated. He seemed like he wanted to say more but couldn’t find the words.\n\n“Please forgive me, Porfiry Petrovitch, for what just happened... I lost my temper,” Raskolnikov said, feeling a bit braver and wanting to show he was calm.\n\n“Don’t worry about it, don’t worry about it,” Porfiry replied happily. “I have a bad temper too, I admit! But we will meet again. If it’s God’s will, we might see a lot of each other.”\n\n“And we will get to know each other really well?” Raskolnikov asked.\n\n“Yes, really well,” Porfiry agreed, squinting at Raskolnikov. “Now you’re going to a birthday party?”\n\n“To a funeral.”\n\n“Right, the funeral! Take care of yourself, and get home safely.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry Petrovitch expresses a desire to meet Raskolnikov again to ask him questions, hinting at their complex relationship."
