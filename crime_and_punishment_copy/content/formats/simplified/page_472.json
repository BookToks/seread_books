Here you are… in our place,” Porfiry said, reaching out both hands to him. “Come, sit down, old man… or maybe you don’t like being called ‘my friend’ and ‘old man’? Please don’t think it’s too friendly… Here, on the sofa.”\n\nRaskolnikov sat down, staring at him. “In our place,” the friendly words, and the French phrase “tout court” were all signs of his style.\n\n“He held out both hands to me, but he didn’t actually give me one—he pulled it back at the last moment,” he thought suspiciously. They were both watching each other, but when their eyes met, they quickly looked away.\n\n“I brought you this paper… about the watch. Here it is. Is it okay, or should I write it again?” \n\n“What? A paper? Yes, yes, don’t worry, it’s fine,” Porfiry said quickly. After he said this, he took the paper and looked at it. “Yes, it’s fine. Nothing more is needed,” he said just as fast and put the paper on the table.\n\nA minute later, while talking about something else, he took it from the table and put it on his desk.\n\n“I believe you said yesterday you wanted to question me… formally… about my connection with the murdered woman?” Raskolnikov started again. “Why did I say ‘I believe’?” flashed through his mind. “Why am I so nervous about saying ‘I believe’?” came in another quick thought. He suddenly felt that his unease from just being around Porfiry, from their first words and looks, had grown to a huge size.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels intense unease and suspicion during his encounter with Porfiry Petrovitch, reflecting his inner turmoil and fear."
