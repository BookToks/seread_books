  "text": "Raskolnikov felt that Sonia was with him forever and would follow him anywhere, no matter what happened. This made his heart ache, but he was getting close to a tough moment.\n\nHe went into the yard with determination. He had to climb to the third floor. \"It will take me a while to get up there,\" he thought. He felt like the important moment was still far away, as if he had plenty of time to think.\n\nHe saw the same old mess, with eggshells on the spiral stairs, open doors to the apartments, and the same smells coming from the kitchens. Raskolnikov hadn’t been here since that day. His legs felt weak, but he kept moving forward. He paused for a moment to catch his breath and gather himself so he could enter like a brave person. \"But why? What for?\" he wondered. \"If I have to face this, does it matter? The worse it is, the better.\" He briefly thought about the \"explosive lieutenant,\" Ilya Petrovitch. Was he really going to him? Couldn’t he go to someone else, like Nikodim Fomitch? Couldn’t he just turn back and go to Nikodim Fomitch’s place? At least that would be more private. No, he decided. He would go to the \"explosive lieutenant.\" If he had to face it, he would do it quickly.\n\nFeeling cold and barely aware of himself, he opened the office door. There were only a few people inside this time—a house porter and a peasant. The doorkeeper didn’t even look out from behind his screen. Raskolnikov walked into the next room. \"Maybe I don’t have to speak yet,\" he thought.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels the weight of his fate as he prepares to confront a pivotal moment in his life, reflecting on his connection to Sonia and the inevitability of his actions."
