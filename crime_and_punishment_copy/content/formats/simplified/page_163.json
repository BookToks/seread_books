I’ve been stressing myself out for days. I hope I get better and stop worrying. But what if I don’t get better at all? I’m so tired of all this!”\n\nHe kept walking without stopping. He really wanted something to distract him, but he didn’t know what to do. A strong feeling was taking over him; he felt a deep dislike for everything around him. He hated everyone he saw—their faces, movements, and gestures. If someone had talked to him, he felt like he might have spat at them or bitten them.\n\nSuddenly, he stopped when he reached the bank of the Little Neva, near the bridge to Vassilyevsky Ostrov. “He lives in that house,” he thought. “I didn’t come to Razumihin on purpose!
