  "text": "\"Crime and Punishment\"\n\n\"Thief! Get out of my place. Call the police!\" shouted Amalia Ivanovna. \"They should be sent to Siberia! Go away!\"\n\nPeople gasped all around. Raskolnikov stayed quiet, staring at Sonia, with quick looks at Luzhin. Sonia stood still, almost not aware of what was happening. She could barely feel surprised. Suddenly, her face turned red; she cried out and covered her face with her hands.\n\n\"No, it wasn't me! I didn't take it! I know nothing about it,\" she cried with a sad voice, and ran to Katerina Ivanovna, who hugged her tightly, trying to protect her from everyone.\n\n\"Sonia! Sonia! I don't believe it! Look, I don't believe it!\" she cried, even though it was clear what had happened. She rocked Sonia back and forth like a baby, kissing her face over and over, then grabbing her hands and kissing them too. \"You took it? How foolish these people are! Oh dear! You are all fools,\" she said to everyone in the room. \"You don't know what a good heart she has, what a wonderful girl she is! She would sell her last piece of clothing and walk barefoot to help you if you needed it! She has the yellow passport because my children were starving; she sold herself for us! Oh, husband, husband! Do you see? Do you see? What a memorial dinner for you! Oh my God! Help her, why is everyone just standing there? Rodion Romanovitch, why don't you stand up for her? Do you believe it too? You are not worth her little finger, all of you together! Good God! Please defend her now!\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia is unjustly accused of theft, prompting Katerina Ivanovna to passionately defend her character and plead for compassion from those around them."
