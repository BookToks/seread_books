The head clerk smiled at him, but the angry assistant superintendent looked confused. \n\n\"That’s not your problem!\" he finally yelled loudly. \"Just make the statement we asked for. Show him, Alexandr Grigorievitch. There’s a complaint against you! You don’t pay your debts! You’re a real piece of work!\" \n\nBut Raskolnikov wasn’t paying attention now; he quickly grabbed the paper, eager to find out what it meant. He read it once, then again, but still didn’t understand. \n\n\"What is this?\" he asked the head clerk. \n\n\"It’s for collecting money on an I O U, a legal notice. You have to either pay it, with all the fees, or write a statement saying when you can pay it. You also need to promise not to leave the city without paying and not to sell or hide your stuff. The creditor can sell your property and take legal action against you.\" \n\n\"But I’m not in debt to anyone!\" \n\n\"That’s not our concern. Here’s an I O U for one hundred and fifteen roubles, legally signed, due for payment. It was given by you to the widow of the assessor Zarnitsyn nine months ago and was transferred to Mr. Tchebarov. So, we’re summoning you for this.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is confronted with a legal notice regarding a debt he claims he does not owe."
