  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nRazumihin had promised to bring Zossimov, and he did. Zossimov agreed to leave the drinking party to visit Raskolnikov, but he came with doubts and suspicion about Razumihin’s happy mood. However, he felt good when he saw that the ladies were really looking forward to his visit. He stayed for just ten minutes and was able to reassure and comfort Pulcheria Alexandrovna completely. He spoke with sympathy but was very serious, like a young doctor during an important meeting. He didn’t talk about anything else and didn’t show any interest in getting to know the two ladies better.\n\nWhen he first arrived, he noticed how beautiful Avdotya Romanovna was but tried not to pay attention to her during the visit. Instead, he focused on Pulcheria Alexandrovna, which made him feel very satisfied inside. He said he thought Raskolnikov was doing better. He explained that the patient’s illness was partly caused by his bad living conditions over the last few months, but it also had a mental side, coming from worries and troubles. When Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked nervously about \"some suspicion of insanity,\" Zossimov answered her.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Zossimov visits Raskolnikov's family, providing reassurance about his health while maintaining a professional distance."
