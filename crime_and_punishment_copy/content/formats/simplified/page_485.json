Raskolnikov got up from the sofa, stopping his hysterical laughter.\n\n“Porfiry Petrovitch,” he began, speaking loudly and clearly, even though his legs shook and he could barely stand. “I see now that you really suspect me of killing that old woman and her sister Lizaveta. I’m tired of this. If you think you have the right to arrest me, then go ahead and do it. But I won’t let you mock me to my face and bother me…”\n\nHis lips shook, his eyes burned with anger, and he couldn’t control his voice.\n\n“I won’t allow it!” he shouted, slamming his fist on the table. “Do you hear me, Porfiry Petrovitch? I won’t allow it.”\n\n“Good heavens! What’s going on?” Porfiry cried, clearly scared. “Rodion Romanovitch, my friend, what’s wrong with you?”\n\n“I won’t allow it,” Raskolnikov shouted again.\n\n“Shh! My friend! They’ll hear and come in. Just think, what would we say to them?” Porfiry whispered in fear, leaning close to Raskolnikov.\n\n“I won’t allow it, I won’t allow it,” Raskolnikov repeated like a robot, but he also whispered suddenly.\n\nPorfiry quickly turned and ran to open the window. \n\n“Some fresh air! And you need some water, my friend.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confronts Porfiry, expressing his frustration over being suspected of murder and demanding to be prosecuted if that is the case."
