You see, Rodya, a lot has happened while you’ve been sick. When you ran away without telling anyone where you were, I got really mad and decided to find you and teach you a lesson. I started looking for you that very day. I ran around asking questions! I had forgotten your current place, but I never really knew it. I only remembered your old place was at the Five Corners, Harlamov’s house. I kept trying to find Harlamov’s house, but later I found out it was actually Buch’s. It’s funny how you mix up names sometimes! I got frustrated and went to the address bureau the next day, and guess what? In two minutes, they found you! Your name is in their records.”\n\n“My name!”\n\n“Of course! But they couldn’t find a General Kobelev while I was there. Anyway, it’s a long story. As soon as I got to this place, I learned all about your situation—everything, brother, I know it all. Nastasya will tell you. I met Nikodim Fomitch, Ilya Petrovitch, the porter, and Mr. Zametov, the head clerk at the police office, and last but not least, Pashenka.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin recounts his efforts to find Rodya after he disappeared, revealing that he has learned about all of Rodya's affairs during his search."
