  "text": "Rodya, are you leaving today?  \nNo!  \nWill you come back?  \nYes... I’ll come.  \nRodya, please don’t be mad. I shouldn’t ask, but can you tell me if it’s far where you’re going?  \nVery far.  \nWhat’s waiting for you there? A job or something?  \nWhatever God gives me... just pray for me.  \n\nRaskolnikov moved toward the door, but she held onto him and looked into his eyes with fear.  \n“Enough, mother,” Raskolnikov said, feeling sorry he had come.  \n“It’s not forever, right? You’ll come back tomorrow?”  \n“I will, I will, goodbye.” He finally pulled away.  \n\nIt was a warm, fresh evening; the day had cleared up. Raskolnikov hurried to his place. He wanted to finish everything before sunset and didn’t want to see anyone until then. As he climbed the stairs, he noticed Nastasya looking at him closely from the samovar.  \n“Did someone come to see me?” he thought, feeling sick at the idea of Porfiry. But when he opened his door, he saw Dounia. She sat alone, deep in thought, and looked like she had been waiting a long time. He stopped in the doorway. She stood up from the sofa, surprised, and faced him. Her eyes were fixed on him.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses a sense of urgency and emotional turmoil as he prepares to leave, reassuring his mother while feeling the weight of his actions."
