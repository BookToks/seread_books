I think I’ve met him somewhere. And this guy is good too,” he nodded at Razumihin. “Do you like him, Dounia?” he asked, suddenly laughing for no clear reason.\n\n“Very much,” Dounia replied.\n\n“Wow! You’re such a pig!” Razumihin said, blushing and standing up from his chair. Pulcheria Alexandrovna smiled softly, but Raskolnikov laughed loudly.\n\n“Where are you going?” \n\n“I have to go.”\n\n“You don’t have to. Stay. Zossimov has left, so you should stay. Don’t go. What time is it? Is it twelve o’clock? Dounia, you have such a pretty watch. But why is everyone quiet again? I’m doing all the talking.”\n\n“It was a gift from Marfa Petrovna,” Dounia said.\n\n“And a very expensive one!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna added.\n\n“Wow! It’s so big! It doesn’t look like a lady’s watch,” Raskolnikov said.\n\n“I like that kind,” Dounia replied.\n\n“So it’s not a gift from her fiancé,” Razumihin thought, feeling happy for no reason.\n\n“I thought it was Luzhin’s gift,” Raskolnikov said.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses a sudden appreciation for the people around him, revealing a moment of unexpected liveliness amidst his inner turmoil."
