The young man stood alone in the middle of the room, listening and thinking. He could hear her unlocking the chest of drawers. \n\n“It must be the top drawer,” he thought. “She keeps the keys in her right pocket, all on one steel ring. There’s one key that’s much bigger than the others, with deep notches. That can’t be for the chest of drawers. There must be another chest or strong-box. That’s good to know. Strong-boxes always have keys like that. But this is so degrading.” \n\nThe old woman came back. \n\n“Here, sir: for ten copecks per rouble a month, I need to take fifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance. For the two roubles I lent you before, you owe me twenty copecks in advance. That adds up to thirty-five copecks. So I will give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the watch. Here it is.” \n\n“What! Only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!” \n\n“Yes, that’s right.” \n\nThe young man didn’t argue and took the money. He looked at the old woman and didn’t rush to leave, as if he still had something to say.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The young man reluctantly pawns his watch to the old woman while contemplating her possessions and the degrading nature of the transaction."
