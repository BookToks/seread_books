  "text": "“I’ve told you before that you should not call me Amalia Ludwigovna; I am Amalia Ivanovna.”\n\n“You are not Amalia Ivanovna, but Amalia Ludwigovna. I’m not one of your fake admirers like Mr. Lebeziatnikov, who is laughing behind the door right now (you can actually hear him laughing and saying ‘they are at it again’). So, I will always call you Amalia Ludwigovna, even if I don’t understand why you don’t like that name. Look at what has happened to Semyon Zaharovitch; he is dying. Please close that door right now and don’t let anyone in. Let him die in peace! If you don’t, I will inform the Governor-General about how you are acting tomorrow. The prince knew me as a girl; he remembers Semyon Zaharovitch well and has helped him many times. Everyone knows that Semyon Zaharovitch had many friends who cared for him, but he pushed them away because of his pride. Now (she pointed to Raskolnikov), a generous young man has come to help us. He has money and connections, and Semyon Zaharovitch has known him since childhood. You can believe me, Amalia Ludwigovna…”\n\nShe spoke very quickly, getting faster and faster, but a cough suddenly interrupted Katerina Ivanovna. At that moment, the dying man regained some awareness and groaned; she rushed to him. The injured man opened his eyes and, without recognizing or understanding, stared at Raskolnikov, who was leaning over him. He took deep, slow, painful breaths; blood dripped from the corners of his mouth, and sweat beaded on his forehead.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna insists on the importance of dignity for the dying Semyon Zaharovitch, urging Amalia Ludwigovna to allow him peace in his final moments."
