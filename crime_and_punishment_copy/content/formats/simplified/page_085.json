  "text": "Raskolnikov's younger brother was buried in a small grave marked by a stone. He didn't remember him because he died when he was just six months old. However, he had heard stories about his brother. Whenever he went to the graveyard, he would cross himself and bow down to kiss the little grave with respect.\n\nIn his dream, he was walking with his father past a tavern on their way to the graveyard. He held his father's hand and felt scared looking at the tavern. He noticed something strange: there was a celebration happening. Many people were dressed up, including peasant women and their husbands, and they were all singing and seemed a bit drunk.\n\nNear the tavern, there was a big cart. Usually, these carts are pulled by strong horses and carry heavy things like barrels of wine. Raskolnikov liked watching those big horses with their long manes and thick legs, moving slowly and easily with their loads. But now, he saw a small, thin horse in the shafts of the cart. This horse was one of those peasants' nags that he often saw struggling to carry heavy wood or hay, especially when the wheels got stuck in mud. The peasants would sometimes beat the horses cruelly, and he felt so sorry for them that he almost cried. His mother would often pull him away from the window when he saw this. Suddenly, there was a loud noise of shouting, singing, and the sound of a balalaika.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov dreams of walking with his father to his younger brother's grave, feeling a mix of dread and sympathy for a struggling horse he sees in a festive scene."
