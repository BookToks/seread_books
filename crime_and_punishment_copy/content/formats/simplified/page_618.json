  "text": "\"Listen,\" he said firmly. \"I don't care what you all think, but I can't understand anything here. Please don’t think I’m asking you questions. I don’t want to know! If you start sharing your secrets, I might just walk away angry. I just want to know if you are really crazy. People say you are mad or almost mad. I have thought that too, based on your strange and awful actions, especially how you've treated your mother and sister. Only a monster or a madman would act like that, so you must be mad.\"\n\n\"When did you last see them?\"\n\n\"Just now. Haven't you seen them since? What have you been doing? I've come to see you three times already. Your mother has been very sick since yesterday. She wanted to come to you, but Avdotya Romanovna tried to stop her. She wouldn’t listen. She said, 'If he is sick and losing his mind, who can take care of him like his mother?' We all came here with her because we couldn’t let her come alone. We kept telling her to stay calm. We came in, but you weren’t here. She sat down and waited for ten minutes while we stood quietly. Then she got up and said, 'If he’s gone out, if he’s well and has forgotten his mother, it’s embarrassing for her to stand at his door asking for kindness.' She went home and went to bed; now she has a fever.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The speaker confronts someone about their madness and neglect of their ill mother and sister, expressing concern over their behavior."
