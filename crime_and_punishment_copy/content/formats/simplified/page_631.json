  "text": "I want to be honest with you—I was the first to point at you. The old woman's notes about the pledges didn’t matter. Yours was just one of many. I also heard about the scene at the office from someone who described it really well. It was just one thing after another, Rodion Romanovitch, my friend! How could I not start thinking certain things? \n\nYou can’t make a horse from a hundred rabbits, and a hundred suspicions don’t prove anything, as the English saying goes. But that’s just from a logical point of view. After all, a lawyer is only human. I also thought about your article in that journal. Do you remember? We talked about it on your first visit. I made fun of you then, but that was just to get you to share more. \n\nI repeat, Rodion Romanovitch, you are sick and impatient. I recognized long ago that you were bold, stubborn, serious, and had felt a lot. I have felt the same way, so your article felt familiar to me. It was written during sleepless nights, with a racing heart, in excitement and hidden passion. That proud, hidden passion in young people can be risky! \n\nI made fun of you back then, but as someone who enjoys literature, I really like those first attempts filled with youthful energy. Your article is strange and unrealistic, but it has a clear honesty, youthful pride, and the courage of despair. It’s a dark piece, but that’s what makes it special. I read your article and set it aside, thinking, “That man won’t take the usual path.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The speaker reflects on the complexities of human emotions and the misunderstandings that arise from them, particularly in relation to Rodion's character and his literary aspirations."
