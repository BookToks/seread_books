Go ahead and shoot!’\n\nDounia lifted the revolver, pale and focused, watching him closely and waiting for him to move. Her bottom lip was white and shaking, and her big black eyes sparkled with intensity. He had never seen her look so beautiful. The fire in her eyes when she raised the gun seemed to ignite something in him, and he felt a sharp pain in his heart. He stepped forward, and then a shot rang out. The bullet barely missed his hair and hit the wall behind him. He stood still and laughed softly.\n\n‘The wasp has stung me. She aimed right at my head. What’s this? Blood?’ He pulled out his handkerchief to wipe the blood that was trickling down his right temple. The bullet had just skimmed his skin.\n\nDounia lowered the revolver and looked at Svidrigaïlov, not so much scared as in a kind of wild shock. She seemed confused about what she was doing and what was happening.\n\n‘Well, you missed! Shoot again, I’ll wait,’ Svidrigaïlov said softly, still smiling but with a dark look. ‘If you keep this up, I’ll have time to grab you before you can shoot again.’\n\nDounia jumped, quickly cocked the gun again, and raised it once more.\n\n‘Let me be,’ she cried in despair. ‘I swear I’ll shoot again. I … I’ll kill you.’\n\n‘Well … at this distance, you can hardly miss. But if you don’t … then.’ His eyes flashed, and he took two steps closer.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia confronts Svidrigaïlov with a revolver, demonstrating her desperation and determination amidst a tense standoff."
