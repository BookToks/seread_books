  "text": "\"Stay,\" he shouted as Raskolnikov was about to leave. \"Listen to me. You all act like silly, fake people! When you have a problem, you worry about it like a hen sitting on an egg. And you even copy each other in that! You don’t have any real life in you! You are like a mix of grease and water instead of having real blood. I don’t trust any of you! No matter what, you all seem less than human! Stop!\" he yelled, getting angrier when he saw Raskolnikov move again. \"Listen! I’m having a party tonight, and I bet the guests are already there. I just ran in to get things ready. If you weren’t such a fool, a total fool, if you were original instead of just copying others… look, Rodya, I know you’re smart, but you’re still a fool! If you weren’t, you’d come to my party tonight instead of walking around outside! Since you’ve gone out, there’s nothing I can do! I’d give you a comfy chair; my landlady has one… some tea, good company… or you could lie on the sofa—at least you’d be with us… Zossimov will be there too. Will you come?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"That’s nonsense!\" Razumihin shouted, losing his patience. \"How do you know? You can’t really decide! You don’t know anything about it… I’ve fought with people many times and then felt bad and gone back to them… You feel ashamed and go back to a person! So remember, Potchinkov’s house on the third floor…\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin passionately urges Raskolnikov to join him for a gathering, criticizing his isolation and lack of social engagement."
