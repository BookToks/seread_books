  "text": "The student talked a lot about a woman named Lizaveta. He said that she was always being beaten by her sister, the old woman, and was treated like a little child, even though Lizaveta was very tall, about six feet. \n\nThe student found this funny and laughed. They started discussing Lizaveta more. The student talked about her with excitement, and the officer listened closely. He even asked the student to send Lizaveta to help him with some sewing. Raskolnikov paid attention and learned everything he could about her.\n\nLizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her half-sister, meaning they had different mothers. She was thirty-five years old. Lizaveta worked hard for her sister, cooking, cleaning, and sewing, and gave all her money to her sister. She never took a job without her sister's permission. \n\nThe old woman had made a will that Lizaveta knew about. In the will, Lizaveta would get nothing but some furniture; all the money was left to a monastery so prayers could be said for the old woman forever. Lizaveta was not as important as her sister, was unmarried, and looked very awkward. She was tall with long feet that pointed outwards. She always wore old shoes made from goat skin but kept herself clean. The student found it especially surprising and funny that Lizaveta was always having babies.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Lizaveta, the half-sister of the old woman, is trapped in a life of servitude and dependency, working tirelessly for her sister while receiving no inheritance."
