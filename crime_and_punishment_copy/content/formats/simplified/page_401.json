Nobody looked at things that way back then, but that’s the truly kind way to see it, I promise you.\n\nAfter saying this, Svidrigaïlov suddenly laughed again. Raskolnikov could see that this man had a strong purpose in his mind and kept it to himself.\n\n“I guess you haven’t talked to anyone for a few days?” he asked.\n\n“Hardly anyone. I guess you’re surprised that I can adapt so easily?” \n\n“No, I’m just surprised that you adapt too easily.”\n\n“Is it because I’m not upset by your rude questions? Why should I be offended? You asked, so I answered,” he replied simply. “You know, I hardly care about anything,” he continued, almost dreamily. “Especially now, I have nothing to do... You can think I’m trying to get close to you for a reason since I said I want to see your sister about something. But honestly, I’m really bored. The last three days have been especially dull, so I’m happy to see you... Don’t be mad, Rodion Romanovitch, but you seem really strange yourself. No matter what you say, something’s off with you, not just right now, but in general... Well, well, I won’t say more, don’t frown!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov expresses his boredom and adaptability while observing Raskolnikov's strange demeanor."
