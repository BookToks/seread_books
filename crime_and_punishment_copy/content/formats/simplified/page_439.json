  "text": "Dounia looked surprised by Svidrigaïlov’s offer. She stood there thinking.\n\n“He has some bad plan,” she said quietly to herself, almost scared.\n\nRaskolnikov noticed her fear. “I think I’ll have to see him again,” he told Dounia.\n\n“We’ll keep an eye on him! I’ll follow him!” Razumihin said with energy. “I won’t lose track of him. Rodya told me to take care of my sister. Can I have your permission too, Avdotya Romanovna?”\n\nDounia smiled and reached out her hand, but she still looked worried. Pulcheria Alexandrovna looked at her nervously, but the three thousand roubles seemed to calm her down.\n\nA little while later, they were all talking happily. Even Raskolnikov listened for a bit, though he didn’t speak. Razumihin was doing most of the talking.\n\n“Why should you leave?” he said excitedly. “What will you do in a small town? The important thing is that you’re all together and you need each other—you really do, trust me. For now, at least... Let me join you, and I promise we’ll come up with a great plan. Listen! I’ll explain everything in detail to you, the whole idea! It came to me this morning, before anything happened... I have an uncle I want you to meet (he’s a very good man)...\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia feels a sense of unease about Svidrigaïlov's intentions, prompting Raskolnikov and Razumihin to vow to protect her."
