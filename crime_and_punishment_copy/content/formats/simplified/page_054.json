  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nEveryone knew that Marfa Petrovna would read the letter on a certain day and place, so many people gathered to listen, even those who had heard it before in their own homes or elsewhere. I think a lot of this was unnecessary, but that's just how Marfa Petrovna is. \n\nIn any case, she managed to clear Dounia’s name completely, and the shame of the whole situation fell entirely on her husband, who was the only one to blame. I started to feel a bit sorry for him; it was really too harsh on him. Dounia was asked to give lessons to several families, but she said no. Suddenly, everyone began to treat her with a lot of respect, and this helped lead to a big change in our lives.\n\nYou should know, dear Rodya, that Dounia has a suitor and she has agreed to marry him. I wanted to tell you about this quickly, and even though it was arranged without asking you first, I hope you won’t be upset with me or your sister. We couldn’t wait for your opinion because you wouldn’t have known all the details without being here. \n\nHere’s what happened: The suitor is Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, who is already a counselor and is related to Marfa Petrovna. She helped bring them together. It started when he showed interest in meeting us through her. He was welcomed properly and had coffee with us.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marfa Petrovna successfully restored Dounia's reputation, leading to her engagement to Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin."
