His lips moved, trying to say something. Sonia felt a wave of fear.\n\n“What’s wrong?” she asked, pulling away a little.\n\n“Nothing, Sonia, don’t be scared…. It’s silly. It really is silly if you think about it,” he said, sounding like he was losing his mind. “Why did I come to hurt you?” he suddenly asked, looking at her. “Why, really? I keep asking myself that, Sonia….”\n\nHe might have been thinking about that question a little while ago, but now he spoke weakly, not really knowing what he was saying, shaking all over.\n\n“Oh, you’re in so much pain!” she said, worried, looking closely at him.\n\n“It’s all silly…. Listen, Sonia.” He suddenly smiled, a weak smile that lasted just a moment. “Do you remember what I meant to tell you yesterday?”\n\nSonia waited, feeling uneasy.\n\n“I said as I left that maybe I was saying goodbye forever, but if I came today, I would tell you who… who killed Lizaveta.”\n\nShe started shaking all over.\n\n“Well, I’m here to tell you.”\n\n“Then you really meant it yesterday?” she whispered, having trouble speaking. “How do you know?” she asked quickly, as if she was anxious.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov struggles with his guilt and the impact of his actions on Sonia, revealing his inner turmoil and the need for confession."
