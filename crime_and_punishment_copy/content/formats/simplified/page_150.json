  "text": "The author had dinner and refused to pay. He said, \"I’ll write a satire about you.\" Last week, another author on a boat used terrible language towards a respectable family. Recently, one got kicked out of a candy shop. Authors, writers, students, and town criers are like that. Ugh! Just go away! I’ll visit you one day, so you better watch out! Do you understand?\n\nLuise Ivanovna quickly bowed in all directions and curtsied her way to the door. But as she reached the door, she bumped into a handsome officer with a fresh face and thick blonde whiskers. This was the district superintendent, Nikodim Fomitch. Luise Ivanovna hurriedly curtsied almost to the ground and walked out of the office with tiny steps.\n\n\"More thunder and lightning—a storm!\" said Nikodim Fomitch to Ilya Petrovitch in a friendly way. \"You’re upset again! I heard it on the stairs!\"\n\n\"Well, what’s the big deal!\" Ilya Petrovitch replied casually. He walked over to another table with some papers, swinging his shoulders. \"Look here: an author or a student, at least he used to be, isn’t paying his debts, gave an I.O.U., won’t leave his room, and people keep complaining about him. Plus, he has the nerve to complain about my smoking in front of him!\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The conversation highlights the disdain for authors and students who fail to pay their debts and create disturbances."
