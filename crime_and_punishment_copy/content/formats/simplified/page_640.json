  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nI don’t want you to think of me as a monster. I really do like you, whether you believe it or not. I’ve come to you with a clear offer: you should confess. It will be much better for both of us, because then my job will be done. So, is this clear from me or not?\n\nRaskolnikov thought for a moment.\n\n“Listen, Porfiry Petrovitch. You just said you have nothing but psychology to go on, but now you’re talking about facts. What if you’re wrong?”\n\n“No, Rodion Romanovitch, I’m not wrong. I have a small fact that came to me from Providence.”\n\n“What small fact?”\n\n“I won’t tell you, Rodion Romanovitch. Either way, I can’t delay it any longer. I have to arrest you. So think about it: it doesn’t really matter to me now, and I’m only saying this for your benefit. Believe me, it will be better, Rodion Romanovitch.”\n\nRaskolnikov smiled in a nasty way.\n\n“That’s not just silly; it’s really shameless. Even if I were guilty, which I don’t agree with, why would I confess when you say I’d be safer in prison?”\n\n“Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, don’t trust words too much. Maybe prison won’t be a peaceful place. That’s just my theory, and what authority do I have for you? Maybe I’m hiding something even now.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry Petrovitch proposes that Raskolnikov should confess to benefit both of them, despite Raskolnikov's skepticism about the necessity of a confession."
