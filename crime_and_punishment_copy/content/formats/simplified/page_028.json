  "text": "I had a situation that I got and then lost again. Do you understand? This time, it was my own fault that I lost it because my weakness showed. Now, we have part of a room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechsel’s place. I can’t say what we live on or how we pay our rent. There are many people living there with us. It’s dirty and messy, like a madhouse.\n\nMeanwhile, my daughter from my first wife has grown up. I won’t talk about what she went through with her stepmother while growing up. Katerina Ivanovna has good feelings, but she is also strong-willed, easily annoyed, and quick to anger. It’s no use going over that!\n\nSonia, as you can imagine, hasn’t had any education. I tried four years ago to teach her geography and world history, but I wasn’t very good at those subjects, and we didn’t have the right books. Now we don’t even have those, so our lessons stopped. We only got to Cyrus of Persia. Since she became an adult, she read some other romantic books and recently read a book called Lewes’ Physiology that she got from Mr. Lebeziatnikov. She even shared some parts of it with us, and that’s all she knows.\n\nNow, may I ask you a personal question, sir? Do you think a decent poor girl can earn much money with honest work? She can’t make more than fifteen farthings a day if she is decent and has no special skill, and that’s without stopping her work for a moment!\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The narrator reflects on the struggles of his family, particularly the hardships faced by his daughter Sonia due to poverty and lack of education."
