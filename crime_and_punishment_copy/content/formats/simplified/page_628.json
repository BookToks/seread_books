  "text": "\"I’ve come to talk to you, Rodion Romanovitch, my friend! I owe you an explanation and I need to give it to you,\" he said with a small smile, gently patting Raskolnikov’s knee.\n\nBut then his face suddenly became serious and tired. Raskolnikov was surprised to see a hint of sadness on his face. He had never seen or expected such an expression before.\n\n\"Last time we met was strange, Rodion Romanovitch. Our first meeting was odd too, but then… things just kept happening! The thing is, I might have treated you unfairly; I feel that. Do you remember how we said goodbye? You were really nervous and your knees were shaking, and so were mine. Our behavior was not good, even unmanly. But we are gentlemen, after all; that should be clear. Do you remember how it ended? It was quite inappropriate.\"\n\n\"What is he doing? What does he think of me?\" Raskolnikov wondered, looking at Porfiry with wide eyes.\n\n\"I’ve decided that being honest is better for us,\" Porfiry Petrovitch continued, turning his head away and looking down, as if he didn’t want to upset Raskolnikov or show his old tricks. \"Yes, these doubts and scenes can't go on for long. Nikolay stopped it, or I don’t know what might have happened. That annoying worker was in the next room at the time—can you believe that? You know that,\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry Petrovitch seeks to clarify and address the tension between him and Raskolnikov, acknowledging their previous unseemly behavior and advocating for openness."
