  "text": "\"I don’t know what to wish you,\" Raskolnikov said as he started to go down the stairs but then turned back. \"I want to wish you success, but your job is so funny.\"\n\n\"Why funny?\" Porfiry Petrovitch asked as he began to leave, but he seemed interested in what Raskolnikov said.\n\n\"Well, you must have been really messing with that poor Nikolay's mind until he confessed! You probably kept telling him he was the murderer, and now that he has confessed, you'll start questioning him again. You’ll say, 'You’re lying! You’re not the murderer! This isn’t your own story!' You have to admit it’s a funny situation!\"\n\n\"He-he-he! You noticed that I told Nikolay it wasn’t his own story just now?\"\n\n\"How could I not notice?\"\n\n\"He-he! You’re very sharp. You notice everything! You have a playful mind! You always see the funny side... he-he! They say that was a special trait of Gogol, among writers.\"\n\n\"Yes, of Gogol.\"\n\n\"Yes, of Gogol... I look forward to seeing you again.\"\n\n\"So do I.\"\n\nRaskolnikov went straight home. He felt so confused that when he got home, he sat on the sofa for fifteen minutes, trying to gather his thoughts. He didn’t try to think about Nikolay; he felt dazed.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reflects on the psychological manipulation involved in Nikolay's confession, finding humor in the absurdity of the situation."
