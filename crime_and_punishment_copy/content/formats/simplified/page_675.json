Finally, he called for the waiter, paid his bill, and got up. \n\n\"I say, I'm drunk, enough talking,\" he said. \"It’s been fun.\" \n\n\"It must be fun!\" Raskolnikov replied as he stood up. \"It’s probably exciting for someone like you to share such wild stories while planning something big in your mind—especially with me here. It’s thrilling!\" \n\n\"Well, if you think that,\" Svidrigaïlov replied, looking at Raskolnikov with some surprise, \"then you’re quite cynical yourself. You have plenty of reasons to be. You understand a lot… and you can do a lot too. But that's enough. I really wish we could have talked more, but I won't forget you. Just wait a bit.\" \n\nSvidrigaïlov left the restaurant, and Raskolnikov followed him. Svidrigaïlov wasn’t very drunk; the wine had affected him for a moment, but it was wearing off. He seemed worried about something important and was frowning. His attitude towards Raskolnikov had changed in the last few minutes, becoming ruder and more mocking. Raskolnikov noticed this and felt uneasy. He became suspicious of Svidrigaïlov and decided to follow him. \n\nThey stepped out onto the sidewalk. \n\n\"You go to the right, and I’ll go to the left, or the other way if you want. Just goodbye for now. I hope we meet again.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov becomes suspicious of Svidrigaïlov's intentions after their conversation in the restaurant."
