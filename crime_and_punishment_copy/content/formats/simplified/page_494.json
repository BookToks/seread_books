  "text": "Rodion Romanovitch, you are really angry. Don’t shout, or I will call the clerks.\n\n“You're lying! Call them! You knew I was sick and tried to make me so upset that I would give myself away. That was your plan! Show me your proof! I get it. You have no real evidence, just some silly suspicions like Zametov’s! You know my character, and you wanted to make me furious so you could bring in priests and deputies. Are you waiting for them? What are you waiting for? Where are they? Show them to me!”\n\n“Why deputies, my friend? People will think strange things! And that wouldn't be following the rules as you say. You don’t understand how this works, my dear fellow. You can’t escape the rules, as you can see,” Porfiry said, listening at the door where there was some noise.\n\n“Ah, they’re coming,” Raskolnikov shouted. “You’ve called for them! You expected them! Well, bring them all: your deputies, your witnesses, whatever you want! I’m ready!”\n\nBut then something strange happened, something so unexpected that neither Raskolnikov nor Porfiry could have guessed it would happen at the end of their meeting.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confronts Porfiry, accusing him of manipulation and demanding evidence against him, leading to an unexpected turn in their tense exchange."
