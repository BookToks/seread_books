  "text": "Svidrigaïlov brought fifteen thousand roubles and asked her to accept it as a gift from him. He had wanted to give her this small gift before their wedding. It wasn't clear why he felt he had to visit them in the pouring rain at midnight, but everything went well. The reactions of surprise and regret were fewer than expected. The gratitude shown was very strong, and even the most sensible mother cried tears of joy.\n\nSvidrigaïlov stood up, laughed, kissed his fiancée, and patted her cheek. He said he would come back soon. He noticed a mix of curiosity and a serious question in her eyes, so he kissed her again, even though he felt angry inside at the thought that his gift would be locked away by her sensible mother. He left them all very excited. The caring mother, speaking softly, eased some of their worries, saying that Svidrigaïlov was a great man with important connections and a lot of money. She thought it was normal for him to give away money whenever he wanted. It was strange that he was soaked, but she mentioned that Englishmen are often even stranger, and people in high society don’t care much about what others say.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov unexpectedly visits his betrothed's parents at midnight, bringing a generous gift that leaves them in awe and speculation about his character."
