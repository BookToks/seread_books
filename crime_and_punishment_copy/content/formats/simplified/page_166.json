You can take three roubles for your work since I already got six roubles in advance. After you finish the signature, there will be another three roubles for you. And don't think I'm doing you a favor; actually, I saw how you could help me. I'm not good at spelling, and sometimes I struggle with German, so I often make it up as I go.
