  "text": "Raskolnikov heard heavy footsteps on the stairs. \n\n“What should I do?” he thought. He unhooked the door, opened it, and listened. It was quiet. Without thinking, he stepped outside, closed the door carefully, and went downstairs.\n\nHe had gone down three flights when he suddenly heard a loud voice from below. He panicked—there was nowhere to hide. He turned back to his flat.\n\n“Hey! Catch him!” someone shouted. A person rushed out of a flat below, yelling and almost falling down the stairs.\n\n“Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Get him!” The shouting ended with a scream, and then everything went quiet. But at that moment, a group of men started coming up the stairs, talking loudly. He recognized the young man’s voice. “They!”\n\nFeeling hopeless, he decided to face them, thinking, “Whatever happens!” If they stopped him, he was done for; if they let him go, he was still in trouble because they would remember him. They were getting closer, just one flight away. Suddenly, he saw a chance! A few steps to his right, there was an empty flat with the door wide open. The painters had just left, and they must have been the ones who had run down shouting.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, filled with despair, faces a critical moment of potential discovery as he navigates a tense situation in the stairwell."
