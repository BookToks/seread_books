Then, he started reading it carefully and went through it twice. Pulcheria Alexandrovna looked worried, and everyone expected something important.\n\n“What surprises me,” he said after a short pause, handing the letter to his mother but not really talking to anyone, “is that he is a businessman, a lawyer, and talks in a fancy way, yet he writes such a simple letter.” \n\nEveryone was shocked. They thought it would be something different. \n\n“But they all write like that, you know,” Razumihin said suddenly. \n\n“Have you read it?” \n\n“Yes.” \n\n“We showed it to him, Rodya. We… asked him just now,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna said, feeling awkward. \n\n“That’s just the way they talk in court,” Razumihin added. “Legal papers are still written like that.” \n\n“Legal?
