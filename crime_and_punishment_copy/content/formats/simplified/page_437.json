  "text": "Alexandrovna mumbled to herself, not fully understanding what had just happened. \n\nEveryone felt relieved, and in just five minutes, they were laughing. But sometimes Dounia turned pale and frowned, remembering what had happened. Pulcheria Alexandrovna was surprised to find that she was also happy; just that morning, she had thought breaking up with Luzhin was a big disaster. Razumihin was really happy. He didn’t want to show it too much yet, but he felt like a huge weight had been lifted off his heart. Now he could dedicate his life to helping them. Anything could happen now! But he was scared to think about what might come next and didn’t want to let his imagination run wild. \n\nRaskolnikov sat quietly, looking serious and uninterested. Even though he had pushed to get rid of Luzhin, he seemed the least affected by what had happened. Dounia thought he was still upset with her, and Pulcheria Alexandrovna watched him nervously. \n\n“What did Svidrigaïlov say to you?” Dounia asked as she walked over to him. \n\n“Yes, yes!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna exclaimed. \n\nRaskolnikov looked up. \n\n“He wants to give you a gift of ten thousand roubles and wants to see you once while I’m there,” he said. \n\n“See her! No way!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna shouted. “And how dare he offer her money!” \n\nThen Raskolnikov told them (in a flat tone) about his talk with Svidrigaïlov, leaving out the part about the ghost.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The characters experience a mix of relief and tension following the decision to end Dounia's engagement to Luzhin, revealing their differing emotional responses."
