Pyotr Petrovitch started to get up from his chair. \n\n\"One of her customers must have killed her,\" Zossimov said confidently. \n\n\"Absolutely,\" Razumihin replied. \"Porfiry isn’t sharing his thoughts, but he is checking everyone who left things with her.\" \n\n\"Checking them?\" Raskolnikov asked loudly. \n\n\"Yes. What’s wrong with that?\" \n\n\"Nothing.\" \n\n\"How does he find them?\" Zossimov asked. \n\n\"Koch gave some names, others are on the wrappers of the items, and some people came forward on their own.\" \n\n\"It must have been a clever and experienced criminal! How bold! How calm!\" \n\n\"That’s not true!\" Razumihin interrupted. \"That’s what confuses everyone. I believe he is not clever or experienced, and this was probably his first crime! The idea that it was a planned crime by a smart criminal doesn’t fit. If he was inexperienced, it’s clear he just got lucky—and luck can change everything. He probably didn’t see the problems ahead! And how did he do it? He took jewelry worth ten or twenty roubles, stuffed his pockets, searched the old woman’s trunks and clothes—and they found fifteen hundred roubles, plus notes, in there.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** the old pawnbroker's possession, indicating the murder was likely committed by an inexperienced individual rather than a cunning criminal."
