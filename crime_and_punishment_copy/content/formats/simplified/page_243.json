Potchinkov’s house, 47, Babushkin’s flat….’\n\n‘I’m not coming, Razumihin.’ Raskolnikov turned and walked away.\n\n‘I bet you will,’ Razumihin called after him. ‘I won’t talk to you if you don’t! Wait, is Zametov in there?’\n\n‘Yes.’\n\n‘Did you see him?’\n\n‘Yes.’\n\n‘Did you talk to him?’\n\n‘Yes.’\n\n‘About what? Don’t tell me then. Remember Potchinkov’s house, 47, Babushkin’s flat!’\n\nRaskolnikov kept walking and turned the corner onto Sadovy Street. Razumihin watched him thoughtfully. Then he waved his hand and went into the house but stopped before the stairs.\n\n‘Darn it,’ he said almost out loud. ‘He talked sense, but still… I’m such a fool! As if crazy people didn’t talk sense! And this is what Zossimov was worried about.’ He tapped his forehead. ‘What if… how could I let him go alone? He might drown himself… What a mistake! I can’t.’ He ran back to catch up with Raskolnikov, but he was already gone. Cursing, he hurried back to the Palais de Cristal to ask Zametov. \n\nRaskolnikov walked straight to X—— Bridge and stood there.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's interactions with Razumihin reveal his troubled state and the concern of his friend for his well-being."
