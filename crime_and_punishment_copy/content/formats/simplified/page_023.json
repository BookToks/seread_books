  "text": "Marmeladov got his habit of giving long speeches from talking to strangers at the tavern. For some drinkers, this habit becomes a need, especially if they are kept in check at home. When they are with other drinkers, they try to explain themselves and get some respect.\n\nThe innkeeper said, \"What a funny guy! Why don’t you work? Why aren’t you doing your job if you have one?\"\n\nMarmeladov answered, talking only to Raskolnikov as if he asked the question. \"Why am I not at my job? It hurts my heart to think how useless I am. A month ago, when Mr. Lebeziatnikov hit my wife and I was drunk, didn’t I suffer?
