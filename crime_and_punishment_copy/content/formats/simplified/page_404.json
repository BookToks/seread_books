  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nYou look at the sea, and it makes you sad. What’s really upsetting is that you actually feel sad! No, it’s better at home. Here, at least you can blame others for everything and excuse yourself. Maybe I should have gone on a trip to the North Pole because I don’t like drinking, and all I have left is wine. I’ve tried it. But, I heard that Berg is going up in a big balloon next Sunday from the Yusupov Garden and will take passengers for a fee. Is that true?\n\n“Would you go up?” \n\n“No, oh no,” Svidrigaïlov said, looking deep in thought.\n\n“What does he mean? Is he serious?” Raskolnikov wondered.\n\n“No, the document didn’t stop me,” Svidrigaïlov continued, thinking. “It was my choice not to leave the country. Almost a year ago, Marfa Petrovna gave me the document back on my name day and also gave me a lot of money. She had a fortune, you know. ‘You see how I trust you, Arkady Ivanovitch’—that’s what she said. You don’t believe she really said that? But I managed the estate well, and people know me in the neighborhood. I even ordered books. At first, Marfa Petrovna approved, but later she worried I was studying too much.”\n\n“Do you miss Marfa Petrovna a lot?” \n\n“Miss her? Maybe. Really, maybe I do. By the way, do you believe in ghosts?” \n\n“What ghosts?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov reflects on his past and the influence of Marfa Petrovna while contemplating the idea of ghosts."
