  "text": "What do you think? Please take off your cap; it looks like you’re about to leave, and that makes me uncomfortable. I’m so happy you’re here.\n\nRaskolnikov took off his cap and listened quietly with a serious face to Porfiry Petrovitch’s vague and pointless talk. He wondered, “Does he really want to distract me with this silly chatter?”\n\n“I can’t offer you coffee, but why not spend five minutes with a friend?” Porfiry kept talking. “You know how it is with official duties... please don’t mind me moving around. I’m worried about upsetting you, but I really need to exercise. I sit too much and I’m happy to be up and moving for a bit. I often think about joining a gym; they say even important officials go there to have fun. That’s modern science for you… yes, yes. \n\nBut regarding my duties here, like inquiries and formalities… you mentioned inquiries just now… I promise you, these questions can be more awkward for the person asking than for the one being asked. You made a clever point about that just now.” (Raskolnikov hadn’t said anything like that.) “It gets confusing! A real mess! It’s like playing the same beat over and over, like a drum! There’s going to be a change, and we’ll be called something different, ha-ha! And about our legal traditions, as you cleverly called them, I completely agree. Every prisoner, even the roughest farmer, knows they start by taking away his weapons.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov listens to Porfiry's aimless chatter, questioning whether it is a distraction from his own thoughts."
