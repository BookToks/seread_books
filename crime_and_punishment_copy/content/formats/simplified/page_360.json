What was the point? And why did you sneak out? Were you thinking clearly when you did it? Now that the danger is over, I can be honest.\"\n\n\"I was really tired of them yesterday,\" Raskolnikov said to Porfiry, smiling defiantly. \"I left to find a place where they wouldn’t find me, and I took a lot of money with me. Mr. Zametov saw it. Hey, Mr. Zametov, was I thinking clearly or not yesterday? You decide.\"\n\nHe felt like he could strangle Zametov right then because of how much he hated his expression and silence. \n\n\"In my opinion, you spoke clearly and even cleverly, but you were very irritable,\" Zametov said dryly. \n\n\"And Nikodim Fomitch told me today that he saw you very late last night at the home of a man who had been hit by a car,\" Porfiry added. \n\n\"And weren’t you crazy then?\" Razumihin said. \"You gave your last money to the widow for the funeral. If you wanted to help, you could have given her fifteen or twenty, but kept three roubles for yourself! Instead, you just gave away all twenty-five!\"\n\n\"Maybe I found treasure somewhere and you don’t know about it? That’s why I was generous yesterday…. Mr. Zametov knows I found treasure! Sorry for bothering you for half an hour with such small talk,\" he said to Porfiry, his lips shaking.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses his defiance and irritation while discussing his recent actions and financial decisions with Razumihin and Zametov."
