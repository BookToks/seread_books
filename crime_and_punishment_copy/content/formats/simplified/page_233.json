You find me interesting, huh?”  \n“Yes, interesting.”  \n“Should I tell you what I was reading about, what I was looking for? Look at all these papers they brought me. Suspicious, right?”  \n“Well, what is it?”  \n“Are you paying attention?”  \n“What do you mean—‘paying attention’?”  \n“I’ll explain that later, but now, my friend, I tell you … no, better to say ‘I confess’ … No, that’s not right either; ‘I’m stating something and you listen.’ I state that I was reading, that I was looking and searching…” he squinted and paused. “I was searching—and came here on purpose to do it—for news about the murder of the old pawnbroker woman,” he finally said in a whisper, getting very close to Zametov’s face. Zametov stared at him without moving or pulling back. What seemed the strangest part to Zametov later was that they stayed silent for a full minute, looking at each other the whole time.  \n“What if you have been reading about it?” he finally said, confused and impatient. “That’s not my problem! So what?”  \n“The same old woman,” Raskolnikov continued in the same whisper, ignoring Zametov’s response, “that you were talking about in the police office, remember, when I fainted. Do you understand now?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confesses to Zametov that he has been searching for news about the murder of the old pawnbroker woman."
