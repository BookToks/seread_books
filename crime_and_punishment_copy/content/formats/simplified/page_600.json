  "text": "Katerina Ivanovna was trying to make the children sing. She got very upset when they didn’t understand what she wanted, and she ended up hitting them. Then she would run at the crowd. If she saw someone well-dressed stopping to watch, she would ask them to see how badly the children from a nice family were doing. If she heard people laughing or making fun, she would go after them and argue. Some people laughed, some shook their heads, but everyone was curious about the crazy woman with the scared kids.\n\nRaskolnikov didn’t see the frying pan that Lebeziatnikov mentioned. Instead of hitting the pan, Katerina Ivanovna clapped her weak hands to make Lida and Kolya dance and Polenka sing. She tried to sing too, but she started coughing badly and got really upset, even crying. What made her the angriest was seeing Kolya and Lida crying and scared.\n\nThey had dressed the children like street performers. The boy wore a red and white turban to look like a Turk. Lida didn’t have a real costume; she just wore a red nightcap that belonged to Marmeladov, with a broken piece of white feather that had been in Katerina Ivanovna’s family for a long time. Polenka was in her regular clothes. She looked nervously at her mother and stayed close to her, trying to hide her tears. She sensed that her mother was not well and felt uneasy.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna desperately tries to make her children perform in the streets, driven by her madness and despair."
