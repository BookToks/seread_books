  "text": "Sonia knew that this would make Katerina Ivanovna feel better and boost her pride. She sat down next to Raskolnikov and quickly nodded to him, looking at him with curiosity. But after that, she avoided looking at him or talking to him. She seemed lost in thought, but kept glancing at Katerina Ivanovna, trying to make her happy. Neither Sonia nor Katerina Ivanovna could wear black for mourning; Sonia had on dark brown clothes, and Katerina Ivanovna wore her only dress, which was dark striped cotton.\n\nThe message from Pyotr Petrovitch went over well. Katerina Ivanovna spoke to Sonia with respect and asked how Pyotr Petrovitch was doing. Then she leaned in close to Raskolnikov and said it would be odd for someone like Pyotr Petrovitch to be in such “strange company,” even though he cared for her family and was friends with her father.\n\n“That’s why I’m so thankful to you, Rodion Romanovitch, for accepting my hospitality even in these circumstances,” she said almost out loud. “I’m sure it’s your special care for my late husband that made you keep your promise.”\n\nThen she looked at her guests with pride and asked the deaf man across the table if he needed more meat and if he had been given any wine. The old man didn’t answer and took a long time to understand what she was asking.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia attempts to comfort Katerina Ivanovna while navigating the awkwardness of their situation and the presence of Raskolnikov."
