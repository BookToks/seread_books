Razumihin, who was by the door, rushed into the room, picked up the sick man, and quickly placed him on the sofa. \n\n\"It's nothing, nothing!\" he shouted to Rodya's mother and sister. \"It's just a faint, a small thing! The doctor just said he was much better, that he is fine! Get some water! Look, he is waking up, he is okay again!\" \n\nHe grabbed Dounia's arm, almost hurting it, and made her bend down to see that \"he is okay again.\" Rodya's mother and sister looked at him with feelings of gratitude, seeing him as their savior.
