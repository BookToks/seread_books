  "text": "A heavy horse-drawn cart passed by, and the driver shouted, “Hey there, German hat maker!” The young man suddenly stopped and nervously grabbed his hat. It was a tall, round hat from a store called Zimmerman's, but it was old, rusty, and completely worn out. The brim was missing, and it was bent to one side in a silly way. Instead of feeling shame, he felt something like fear.\n\n“I knew it,” he muttered, feeling confused. “I thought so! This is the worst! A silly thing like this could ruin my whole plan. My hat is too noticeable. It looks ridiculous, and that makes it stand out. With my old clothes, I should be wearing a cap or any old hat, but not this silly one. Nobody wears a hat like this; it would be remembered. If people remember it, they might figure things out. For what I’m planning, I need to blend in as much as possible. Small details matter! It’s these little things that always mess everything up.”\n\nHe didn’t have far to go. He knew exactly how many steps it was from the gate of his boarding house: seven hundred and thirty steps. He had counted them once when he was daydreaming. At that time, he didn’t believe in those dreams and thought they were just silly. Now, a month later, he started to see those dreams differently. Despite making fun of his own weakness and uncertainty, he couldn’t help but see this “ugly” dream as something he could try, even though he still felt unsure.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The young man is consumed by anxiety over his conspicuous hat, fearing it could jeopardize his carefully planned actions."
