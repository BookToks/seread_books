If I think someone might be a criminal in a case I’m working on… you’re studying law, right, Rodion Romanovitch?\n\n‘Yes, I was…’\n\n‘Well, this is something for you to remember for the future—though I wouldn’t want to tell you what to do after the articles you write about crime! I just want to point out that if I suspect someone of being a criminal, why should I stress them out too soon, even if I have proof against them? Sometimes I have to arrest someone right away, but other times the situation is different, so why shouldn’t I let them walk around for a while? He-he-he! But I see you don’t fully get it, so let me give you a clearer example. If I put someone in jail too quickly, I might actually give them support, he-he! Are you laughing?’\n\nRaskolnikov wasn’t laughing.
