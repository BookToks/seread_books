  "text": "Svidrigaïlov was in a small back room next to a saloon where many people, like merchants and clerks, were drinking tea at little tables. There was loud singing from a chorus, and you could hear billiard balls clicking in the distance. On the table in front of Svidrigaïlov, there was an open bottle and a glass half full of champagne. \n\nIn the room, there was also a boy with a small hand organ and a healthy-looking girl of eighteen. She was wearing a striped skirt and a Tyrolese hat with ribbons. Even with the loud singing from the other room, she was singing a song in a deep voice, accompanied by the organ.\n\n“Okay, that’s enough,” Svidrigaïlov said when Raskolnikov came in. The girl stopped singing and stood quietly, looking serious and respectful.\n\n“Hey, Philip, get a glass!” Svidrigaïlov shouted.\n\n“I don’t want to drink anything,” Raskolnikov replied.\n\n“That's fine; it wasn’t meant for you. Drink, Katia! I don’t want anything else today, so you can go.” He poured her a full glass and gave her a yellow note.\n\nKatia quickly drank her wine in one go, took the note, and kissed Svidrigaïlov’s hand, which he accepted seriously. She left the room, and the boy followed her with the organ. Svidrigaïlov had only been in Petersburg for a week, but he already seemed familiar with everyone; the waiter, Philip, was now a good friend.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov encounters Svidrigaïlov in a tavern where he observes a lively yet dismal scene filled with drinking and singing."
