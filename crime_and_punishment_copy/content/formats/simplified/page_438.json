  "text": "Dounia asked, \"What did you say to him?\"  \n\"I first said I wouldn't take any message to you,\" he replied. \"Then he said he would try to meet you without my help. He claimed that his feelings for you were just a passing crush and that he doesn't want you to marry Luzhin. His words were kind of confusing.\"  \n\n\"How do you understand him, Rodya? What do you think of him?\"  \n\"I have to admit, I don't really get him. He offers you ten thousand, yet says he isn't rich. He says he's leaving, but then forgets he said that in just ten minutes. He also says he’s getting married and already has a girl in mind. He must have a reason for all this, probably a bad one. But it's strange that he’s so awkward about it if he has plans against you. I refused the money for your sake. Overall, I found him very odd. He might even seem crazy. But I could be wrong; maybe it's just an act. The death of Marfa Petrovna seems to have affected him a lot.\"  \n\n\"May her soul rest in peace,\" said Pulcheria Alexandrovna. \"I will always pray for her! Where would we be now, Dounia, without this three thousand? It's like it fell from the sky! Rodya, this morning we only had three roubles, and Dounia and I were thinking of pawning her watch to avoid borrowing money.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses confusion about Svidrigaïlov's strange behavior and motives regarding Dounia, while Pulcheria Alexandrovna feels grateful for a financial windfall after Marfa Petrovna's death."
