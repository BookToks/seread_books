But when she saw Raskolnikov, she quickly got up and walked over to him as if she had been waiting for him. \n\n“What would I have done without you?” she said quickly, meeting him in the middle of the room. \n\nIt was clear she was eager to say this. Raskolnikov sat down at the table in the chair she had just left. She stood in front of him, just like the day before. \n\n“Well, Sonia?” he said, and he could feel his voice shaking. “It was all because of your social position and the habits that come with it. Did you understand that just now?” \n\nHer face showed she was upset. \n\n“Just don’t talk to me like you did yesterday,” she interrupted. “Please don’t start that again. There’s enough misery already.” \n\nShe quickly smiled, worried he might not like her criticism. \n\n“I was foolish to leave there. What is happening now? I wanted to go back right away, but I kept thinking that you would come.” \n\nHe told her that Amalia Ivanovna was kicking them out of their home and that Katerina Ivanovna had run off somewhere to “seek justice.” \n\n“Oh my God!” Sonia cried. “Let’s go right now…” \n\nShe grabbed her cape. \n\n“It’s always the same thing!” Raskolnikov said irritably. “You only think about them! Stay here for a bit.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia expresses her gratitude to Raskolnikov for his support, while he struggles with his own emotions and the turmoil surrounding their lives."
