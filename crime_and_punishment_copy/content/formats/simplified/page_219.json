And he got away with it more by luck than by good advice!\n\n‘You’re talking about the murder of the old pawnbroker, right?’ Pyotr Petrovitch said to Zossimov. He was standing with his hat and gloves, but before leaving, he wanted to share a few more smart comments. He clearly wanted to impress others, and his pride got the better of him.\n\n‘Yes. Have you heard about it?’\n\n‘Oh, yes, since I’m in the area.’\n\n‘Do you know the details?’\n\n‘I can’t say for sure; but there’s something else that interests me about this case—the bigger picture. Crime has been rising a lot among poor people in the last five years, and there have been many robberies and fires. What surprises me most is that crime is also increasing among rich people. In one place, a student robbed the mail; in another, people with good backgrounds forged fake money. Recently in Moscow, a group was caught for making fake lottery tickets, and one of the leaders was a history teacher; then our secretary abroad was killed for some unclear reason related to money... If this old woman, the pawnbroker, was killed by someone from a richer class—because peasants don’t pawn gold jewelry—how do we explain this decline in morals?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The conversation reveals concerns about the increasing prevalence of crime across all social classes, highlighting a moral decline in society."
