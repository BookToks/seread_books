A person must be blind not to see it!” \n\nRaskolnikov looked at Sonia as he said this, but he didn’t care if she understood. He was feeling very intense emotions and had not talked to anyone for a long time. Sonia realized that his dark beliefs had become his new way of living.\n\n“I figured out, Sonia,” he said eagerly, “that power is only given to those who are brave enough to reach for it. There is only one important thing: you just have to be brave! For the first time in my life, I had an idea that no one had ever thought of before. I clearly saw how strange it is that no one in this crazy world has had the courage to go after it all and throw it away! I… I wanted to be brave… and I killed her. That was the only reason!”\n\n“Oh hush, hush,” Sonia cried, putting her hands together. “You turned away from God, and God has punished you, given you to the devil!”\n\n“Then, Sonia, when I lay in the dark and all this became clear to me, was it really the devil tempting me?” \n\n“Hush, don’t laugh, blasphemer! You don’t understand! Oh God! He won’t understand!”\n\n“Hush, Sonia! I’m not laughing. I know that the devil was leading me. Hush, Sonia, hush!” he repeated with a serious tone. “I know it all; I have thought it through.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov believes that true power comes from daring to take extreme actions, which he justifies as the reason for his crime."
