  "text": "Raskolnikov felt something important was happening when Pyotr Petrovitch arrived. He moved aside for him, but Pyotr didn’t notice him. A minute later, Lebeziatnikov appeared at the door. He didn’t come in but stood outside, listening with interest and looking confused for a moment.\n\n“Sorry to interrupt, but I have something important to say,” Pyotr Petrovitch said to everyone. “Amalia Ivanovna, as the owner of this house, please listen to what I have to say to Sofya Ivanovna.” \n\nHe turned to Sonia, who looked surprised and scared. “Right after your visit, I found that a hundred-rouble note was missing from my table in Mr. Lebeziatnikov’s room. If you know where it is and tell us, I promise that will be the end of it. If not, I will have to take serious action, and then it will be your fault.”\n\nThe room was completely silent. Even the crying children stopped. Sonia was very pale, staring at Luzhin and unable to speak. She seemed confused. A few seconds went by.\n\n“Well, what will it be?” Luzhin asked, looking closely at her.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pyotr Petrovitch accuses Sonia of stealing a hundred-rouble note, threatening serious consequences if she does not confess."
