I’ve never understood this more than now, and I still don’t see what I did as a crime. I’ve never felt stronger or more sure than I do now.”\n\nHis pale face turned red, but when he looked into Dounia’s eyes, he saw so much pain in them that it stopped him. He realized he had made these two women sad, and he was the reason for it.\n\n“Dounia, if I’m guilty, please forgive me (even though I can’t be forgiven if I am guilty). Goodbye! Let’s not argue. It’s time to go. Please don’t follow me; I have somewhere else to be. But you should go and be with mother. I really ask you to! It’s my last wish. Don’t leave her alone; I left her worried, and she can’t handle it. She might get sick or lose her mind. Be with her! Razumihin will be with you. I’ve talked to him. Don’t cry for me: I’ll try to be good and strong all my life, even if I am a murderer. Maybe one day I’ll make a name for myself. I won’t shame you, you’ll see. Now, goodbye for now,” he said quickly, noticing a strange look in Dounia’s eyes at his last words. “Why are you crying? Don’t cry, don’t cry: we’re not saying goodbye forever! Oh, wait a minute, I almost forgot!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist grapples with his guilt and the impact of his actions on his loved ones, asserting his conviction that he is not a criminal despite his confession."
