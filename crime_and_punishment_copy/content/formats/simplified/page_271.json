First, they say the ‘Ave Maria,’ and then another prayer: ‘Lord, forgive and bless sister Sonia,’ and then another one, ‘Lord, forgive and bless our second father.’ Our real father is dead, and this is another one, but we pray for the other one too.”  \n“Polenka, my name is Rodion. Please pray for me sometimes too. Just say, ‘And Thy servant Rodion,’ nothing more.”  \n“I’ll pray for you for the rest of my life,” the little girl said eagerly, and then she smiled and hugged him warmly again.  \n\nRaskolnikov told her his name and address and promised to come back the next day. The child left feeling very happy. It was past ten when he stepped outside. In five minutes, he was on the bridge where the woman had jumped in.  \n“Enough,” he said firmly and proudly. “I’m done with dreams and fears! Life is real! Didn’t I just live? My life hasn’t ended with that old woman! The Kingdom of Heaven for her—and now leave me alone! Now it’s time for reason and light… and will, and strength… and now we will see! We will test our strength!” he said defiantly, as if challenging some dark force. “I was ready to agree to live in a small space! I feel very weak right now, but… I believe my sickness is over. I knew it would be over when I went outside.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov resolves to embrace life and strength after a meaningful encounter with a young girl."
