  "text": "I committed a murder again. I wanted to find something out. I wanted to know quickly if I was like everyone else or if I was different. Could I break the rules or not? Was I strong enough to pick myself up, or was I weak?\n\n\"To kill? Do you have the right to kill?\" Sonia clasped her hands. \n\n“Oh, Sonia!” he said irritably, almost ready to argue, but then he stayed quiet. “Don’t interrupt me, Sonia. I just want to show one thing: the devil led me to do it, and he showed me since that I didn’t have the right to take that path because I’m just as worthless as everyone else. He was making fun of me, and now I’ve come to you! Welcome your guest! If I wasn’t worthless, would I have come to you? Listen: when I went to the old woman, I only went to try… You can believe that!”\n\n“And you murdered her!”\n\n“But how did I murder her? Is that how people commit murder? Do they go to kill someone like I did? I’ll tell you one day how I went! Did I really murder the old woman? I killed myself, not her! I destroyed myself for good… But it was the devil who killed that old woman, not me. Enough, Sonia, enough! Let me be!” he shouted in pain, “let me be!”\n\nHe leaned his elbows on his knees and squeezed his head in his hands tightly.\n\n“What suffering!” Sonia cried out in distress.\n\n“Well, what am I supposed to do now?” he asked, suddenly looking at her with a twisted face.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist grapples with the moral implications of his actions, feeling that he has not only killed another but has also destroyed himself in the process."
