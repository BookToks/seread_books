  "text": "Svidrigaïlov looked at him closely, and Raskolnikov thought he saw a hint of cruel mockery in his gaze. But Svidrigaïlov kept his cool and answered politely:\n\n\"Yes, it was. I can see that you’re very curious, and I feel it’s my duty to satisfy your curiosity when I can. Honestly, I think I could be seen as a romantic figure by some. Just think how grateful I am to Marfa Petrovna for sharing such mysterious and interesting gossip about me with Avdotya Romanovna. I can’t guess how it affected her, but it worked out well for me. Despite Avdotya Romanovna’s natural dislike for me and my always gloomy and unwelcoming appearance, she felt pity for me, pity for a lost soul. And when a girl’s heart feels pity, it can be very dangerous. She will want to 'save him,' help him see things differently, lift him up, and bring him back to a better life—everyone knows how far such dreams can go. I realized right away that she was walking straight into her own trap. And I was ready too. \n\nI think you look worried, Rodion Romanovitch? No need to be. As you know, it all ended without anything happening. (Goodness, I’ve been drinking a lot!) You know, I’ve always wished that your sister had been born in the second or third century A.D., as the daughter of a prince or a governor in Asia Minor. She would definitely have been one of those who would endure suffering and would smile even when they branded her chest.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov reflects on the dangerous allure of pity and the potential for manipulation in relationships, particularly regarding Avdotya Romanovna."
