What great words they have; they sound so scientific and comforting. Once you say ‘percentage,’ there’s nothing more to think about. If we had a different word, maybe we would feel more worried. But what if Dounia is part of that percentage? Or another one, if not that one?\n\n‘But where am I going?’ he suddenly thought. ‘Strange, I came out for something. As soon as I read the letter, I came out. I was going to Vassilyevsky Ostrov, to Razumihin. That’s what it was … now I remember. But why? And why did I think of going to Razumihin just now? That’s odd.’\n\nHe wondered about himself. Razumihin was one of his old friends from university.

He didn’t join in the students’ gatherings, fun, or talks. He worked very hard without taking breaks, and people respected him for that, but no one liked him. He was very poor, and he had a sort of proud and reserved attitude, as if he was hiding something. He seemed to some of them...\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reflects on the societal acceptance of moral decay and his own isolation from peers while contemplating a visit to Razumihin."
