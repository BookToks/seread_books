  "text": "An old woman wearing a headscarf and goat-skin shoes suddenly put money in his hand. He looked and saw she was with a girl, probably her daughter, who had a hat and was holding a green parasol. \n\n“Take it, my good man, in Christ’s name,” she said. \n\nHe took the money, which was twenty copecks, and they walked away. From how he looked and dressed, they might have thought he was a beggar asking for help, and they probably felt sorry for him after seeing his injury. \n\nHe closed his hand around the twenty copecks, walked a few steps, and then turned to face the Neva River, looking toward the palace. The sky was clear, and the water was a bright blue, which is rare for the Neva. The dome of the cathedral, best seen from a bridge nearby, sparkled in the sunlight, and every detail could be seen clearly in the fresh air. \n\nThe pain from his injury faded, and he forgot about it. One uneasy thought took over his mind. He stood still and stared into the distance; this place was very familiar to him. When he was in university, he had often stopped here on his way home, looking at this beautiful view. It always stirred a strange feeling in him, but it left him feeling cold. This stunning scene felt blank and lifeless to him. He often wondered why it made him feel this way, but he kept putting off finding an answer.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov receives a small donation from a woman, prompting him to reflect on his past feelings of detachment and the beauty of his surroundings."
