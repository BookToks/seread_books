  "text": "The staircase was crowded with porters carrying books, policemen, and all kinds of people. The office door was wide open. Inside, peasants were waiting. It was really hot, and there was a bad smell from fresh paint and old oil in the newly decorated rooms.\n\nAfter waiting a bit, he decided to go into the next room. All the rooms were small and low. He felt very impatient and wanted to keep moving. No one noticed him. In the second room, some clerks were writing, and they looked just as messy as he did. He approached one of them.\n\n“What do you want?” the clerk asked.\n\nHe showed the notice he had received.\n\n“Are you a student?” the clerk asked, looking at the notice.\n\n“Yes, I used to be a student,” he replied.\n\nThe clerk looked at him but didn’t seem interested at all. He looked messy and had a blank expression.\n\nRaskolnikov thought, “I can’t get anything from him because he doesn’t care about anything.”\n\n“Go to the head clerk in that room,” the clerk said, pointing to the farthest room.\n\nHe went into that room—it was the fourth one. It was small and full of people who were dressed a bit better than in the other rooms. There were two ladies among them. One lady, dressed in mourning, sat at a table across from him.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov navigates a crowded, stifling office filled with indifferent clerks and a sense of impatience."
