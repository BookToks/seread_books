  "text": "Raskolnikov was confused about what he was doing. \n\n“I might bring you something else soon, Alyona Ivanovna—a valuable thing—a silver cigarette box, as soon as I get it back from a friend…” he stopped, unsure.\n\n“Well, we can talk about it then,” she replied.\n\n“Goodbye—are you always home alone? Is your sister not here with you?” he asked casually as he left.\n\n“What does that matter to you, sir?” she answered.\n\n“Oh, nothing special, I just asked. You’re too quick to respond… Good day, Alyona Ivanovna.”\n\nRaskolnikov left feeling very confused. His confusion grew as he walked down the stairs. He stopped a few times, as if a thought had hit him. Once outside, he shouted, “Oh, God, this is all so disgusting! How could I even think of this? It’s nonsense!” He felt his heart was capable of terrible things. “Yes, it’s filthy, disgusting, loathsome! And for a whole month, I’ve been…” But he couldn't find the words to express how upset he was. The strong feeling of disgust that had started to weigh on him while going to see the old woman had become so intense that he didn’t know how to escape his misery. He walked down the street like a drunk person, not caring about the people around him, bumping into them.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences intense confusion and repulsion after a troubling encounter with Alyona Ivanovna, reflecting on the dark thoughts that have plagued him."
