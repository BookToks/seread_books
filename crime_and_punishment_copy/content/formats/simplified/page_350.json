  "text": "Raskolnikov felt bad about not finishing his studies. He said, \"What a pity!\" He thought about everything that happened, especially what Zametov said. \"You know, Rodya, I talked nonsense on the way home yesterday when I was drunk. I'm worried you might think I’m exaggerating,\" he added.\n\n\"What? That they think I'm crazy? Maybe they are right,\" he said with a forced smile.\n\n\"Yes, yes... I mean, no! But everything I said was just drunken nonsense.\"\n\n\"Why are you apologizing? I'm so tired of all this!\" Raskolnikov shouted, acting more upset than he really was.\n\n\"I know, I know, I understand. It's embarrassing to talk about it.\"\n\n\"If you're embarrassed, then don't talk about it.\"\n\nThey both went quiet. Razumihin seemed overly excited, and Raskolnikov felt disgusted by it. He was also worried about what Razumihin said about Porfiry.\n\n\"I’ll have to act serious with him too,\" he thought, feeling anxious and turning pale. \"But it would be best to just do nothing. But doing nothing wouldn’t feel natural either... Well, we’ll see what happens. Is it a good idea to go or not? My heart is racing, and that’s not good!\"\n\n\"In this grey house,\" Razumihin said.\n\n\"The most important thing is, does Porfiry know that I was...?\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses his anxiety and irritation about his situation and the perceptions of those around him."
