  "text": "Katerina Ivanovna praised people’s connections and wealth just for the fun of it, without wanting anything in return. She was probably influenced by Luzhin. The awful Lebeziatnikov didn’t show up either. He was only invited out of kindness because he shared a room with Pyotr Petrovitch and was his friend, so it would have been weird not to invite him.\n\nSome people who didn’t come were a fancy lady and her old-fashioned daughter. They had only lived in the house for two weeks but had complained several times about the noise in Katerina Ivanovna’s room, especially when Marmeladov came home drunk. Katerina Ivanovna found out about this from Amalia Ivanovna, who had argued with her and threatened to kick the family out, saying they weren’t worth the trouble of the nice lodgers they disturbed.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna decided to invite the lady and her daughter, even though they had looked down on her before. She wanted them to see that she was better than they thought and that she didn’t hold grudges. She planned to show this during dinner by talking about her father’s important job and hinting that it was silly for them to turn away when they met her.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna invites her haughty neighbors to dinner to demonstrate her nobility and disinterest in malice despite their disdain."
