The table looked nice, and the cloth was clean.\n\n\"It would be great, Nastasya, if Praskovya Pavlovna could send us a couple of bottles of beer. We could drink them,\" he said.\n\n\"You're something else,\" Nastasya replied, and then she left to get the beer.\n\nRaskolnikov looked around with a worried expression. Meanwhile, Razumihin sat down on the sofa next to him, awkwardly put his left arm around Raskolnikov's head, and with his right hand, he offered him a spoonful of soup, blowing on it so it wouldn't be too hot. But the soup was just warm. Raskolnikov quickly ate one spoonful, then another, then a third. After giving him a few more spoonfuls, Razumihin suddenly stopped and said he needed to ask Zossimov if Raskolnikov should have more.\n\nNastasya came back with two bottles of beer. \n\n\"Do you want tea?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Go on, Nastasya, and bring some tea. We can have tea without asking anyone. But hereâ€™s the beer!\" He moved back to his chair, pulled the soup and meat closer, and started eating like he hadn't eaten in three days.\n\n\"I have to tell you, Rodya, I eat like this here every day.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is being cared for by Razumihin, who provides him with soup and beer as they share a moment of camaraderie."
