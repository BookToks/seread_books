What can you do except take them to live with you?\"  \n\"Oh, I don’t know,\" Sonia cried, almost hopeless, and put her hands on her head.  \nIt was clear that she had thought about this idea many times before, and he had just reminded her of it.  \n\"And what if, even now, while Katerina Ivanovna is alive, you get sick and have to go to the hospital? What will happen then?\" he asked harshly.  \n\"How can you say that? That can't happen!\"  \nSonia's face showed terrible fear.  \n\"Can't happen?\" Raskolnikov said with a cold smile.  \n\"You’re not protected from it, are you? What will happen to them then? They will be out on the street, all of them. She will cough, beg, and hit her head against a wall, like she did today, and the children will cry. Then she will collapse, be taken to the police and the hospital, she will die, and the children...\"  \n\"Oh, no... God will not let that happen!\" Sonia finally cried out, overwhelmed.  \nShe listened, looking at him with pleading eyes, holding her hands together as if everything depended on him.  \nRaskolnikov stood up and started to walk around the room.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia expresses despair over the potential suffering of Katerina Ivanovna and the children, fearing their dire future if circumstances worsen."
