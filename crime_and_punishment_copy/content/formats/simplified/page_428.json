  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nLuzhin said he felt insulted because someone twisted what he said in a private talk over coffee. He meant that marrying a poor girl who has faced struggles is better for marriage than marrying someone who has always lived in luxury. He thought that his words were made to sound silly and that he was accused of having bad intentions. He hoped Pulcheria Alexandrovna could show him he was wrong and make him feel better. He asked her how she repeated his words in her letter to Rodion Romanovitch.\n\n“I don’t remember,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna said nervously. “I repeated what I understood. I don’t know how Rodya told you, maybe he made it sound worse.”\n\n“He couldn’t have made it worse unless you encouraged him,” Luzhin replied.\n\n“Pyotr Petrovitch,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna said firmly, “the fact that Dounia and I are here shows we didn’t take your words badly.”\n\n“Good, mother,” Dounia said with approval.\n\n“Then this is my fault again,” Luzhin said, feeling upset.\n\n“Well, Pyotr Petrovitch, you keep blaming Rodion, but you just wrote something false about him,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna said, feeling braver.\n\n“I don’t remember writing anything false,” Luzhin replied.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Luzhin accuses Raskolnikov of misrepresenting his words, while Pulcheria Alexandrovna defends her son and challenges Luzhin's claims."
