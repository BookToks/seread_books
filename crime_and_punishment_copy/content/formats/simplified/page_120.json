Then he heard a faint cry, like someone was softly moaning. After that, there was silence for a minute or two. He squatted by the box and waited, holding his breath. Suddenly, he jumped up, grabbed the axe, and ran out of the bedroom.\n\nIn the middle of the room stood Lizaveta, holding a big bundle. She looked shocked as she stared at her murdered sister, pale and unable to scream. When she saw him run out, she started to shake all over, like a leaf, and a shiver went down her face. She raised her hand and opened her mouth, but no sound came out, as if she couldn’t breathe to scream. She began to slowly back away into a corner, staring at him intently but still not making a sound.\n\nHe rushed at her with the axe. Her mouth twitched sadly, like a frightened baby who is about to scream. Lizaveta was so scared that she didn’t even try to protect her face, even though it was the most natural thing to do at that moment, with the axe raised above her. She only lifted her empty left hand, not to cover her face, but as if to motion him away. The axe came down sharply on her head and split it open.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, in a state of panic, confronts Lizaveta after committing murder, leading to a violent and tragic encounter."
