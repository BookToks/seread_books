  "text": "Raskolnikov lost control and grabbed the old woman's bag but then dropped it and ran into the hallway. \n\nHe felt more and more afraid, especially after the second murder. He wanted to escape the place as quickly as he could. If he had been able to think clearly, he would have realized how bad his situation was and how many problems he still had to face or more crimes he might have to commit to get home. He might have decided to give himself up, not out of fear, but because he felt sick about what he had done. \n\nHis feeling of disgust grew stronger every minute. He wouldn't have gone back to the room for anything. But he started to feel blank and dreamy; sometimes he forgot himself and focused on small things. When he looked into the kitchen and saw a bucket with some water, he thought about washing his hands and the axe. His hands were sticky with blood. He put the axe in the water, grabbed a piece of soap from the window, and started washing his hands in the bucket. Once his hands were clean, he took out the axe, washed the blade, and spent a long time cleaning the wood.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, overwhelmed by fear and loathing after committing a second murder, struggles with the horror of his actions while attempting to clean himself and the murder weapon."
