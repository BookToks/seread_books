He was drunk and threw himself under the horses! What earnings? He brought us nothing but trouble. He drank away everything, the drunkard! He stole from us to buy alcohol, ruining our lives! Thank God he’s dying! One less person to take care of!”\n\n“You must forgive at the time of death; feeling this way is a big sin, madam.”\n\nKaterina Ivanovna was focused on the dying man. She was giving him water, cleaning the blood and sweat from his head, and fixing his pillow. She only turned to the priest now and then. Now she almost yelled at him in anger.\n\n“Ah, father! Those are just words! Forgive! If he hadn’t been run over, he would have come home drunk today, with his only shirt dirty and torn, and he would have fallen asleep like a rock. I would have been up all night washing his rags and the kids’ clothes, then drying them by the window. As soon as it was light, I would have been fixing them. That’s how I spend my nights! … What’s the point of talking about forgiveness? I’ve already forgiven him!”\n\nA terrible, hollow cough interrupted her. She pressed her handkerchief to her lips and showed it to the priest, holding her other hand to her aching chest.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna expresses her anger and frustration over her husband's alcoholism and the burden it has placed on her life, dismissing the idea of forgiveness in his dying moments."
