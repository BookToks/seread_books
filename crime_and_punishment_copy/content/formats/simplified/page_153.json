He seemed a bit embarrassed.\n\n‘Write!’ said the head clerk to Raskolnikov.\n\n‘Write what?’ Raskolnikov asked gruffly.\n\n‘I will tell you what to write.’\n\nRaskolnikov felt that the head clerk was treating him more casually and with disrespect after his outburst. But strangely, he suddenly didn’t care what anyone thought. This change happened in an instant. If he had thought about it, he would have been surprised that he had spoken to them like that just a minute before, forcing his feelings on them. \n\nAnd where did those feelings come from? If the room had been filled with people he cared about, he wouldn’t have been able to say a single kind word to them because his heart felt so empty. A heavy feeling of endless loneliness filled his soul. It wasn’t just the embarrassment of his emotional outburst in front of Ilya Petrovitch, nor Ilya’s victory over him that caused this sudden change in his heart. What did he care about his own weaknesses, all these small worries, officers, German women, debts, and police offices?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a profound sense of emotional detachment and solitude, realizing the emptiness of his previous sentiments in the face of indifference from the police officers."
