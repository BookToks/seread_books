  "text": "In Siberia, there is a town by a wide, lonely river. This town has a fortress, and inside the fortress, there is a prison. Rodion Raskolnikov, a second-class convict, has been in this prison for nine months. It has been a year and a half since he committed his crime.\n\nHis trial was not very complicated. He stuck to his story clearly and honestly. He did not mix up the facts, change them for his benefit, or leave out any details. He explained everything about the murder, including the piece of wood with metal that was found in the victim's hand. He described how he took her keys, what they looked like, and what was in the chest. He also talked about the murder of Lizaveta, how Koch and a student knocked on the door, and what they said. He explained how he ran downstairs and heard Nikolay and Dmitri shouting, how he hid in an empty flat, and then went home. He pointed out the stone in the yard on Voznesensky Prospect where the purse and trinkets were found. Everything was very clear. The lawyers and judges were impressed by how he told his story.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Rodion Raskolnikov, a convict in Siberia, has been imprisoned for nine months after clearly and accurately confessing to his crime and detailing the events surrounding it."
