Just look!’ He pulled out Raskolnikov’s old, broken boot covered in dry mud. ‘I didn’t come empty-handed—they took the size from this monster. We all did our best. And your landlady took care of your linen. Here are three shirts, made of hemp but with a nice front.  \n\nNow, the costs: the cap is eighty copecks, the suit is two roubles twenty-five copecks, so together that’s three roubles five copecks. The boots are a rouble and a half, and they are very good. That makes four roubles fifty-five copecks. The underclothes cost five roubles, which totals nine roubles fifty-five copecks. You get forty-five copecks back in change. Will you take it? So, Rodya, you have a complete new outfit, and your overcoat is still good and stylish.  \n\nAs for your socks and other things, I’ll leave that to you; we have twenty-five roubles left. Don’t worry about Pashenka and paying for your room; she’ll trust you. Now, brother, let me change your linen; I bet you’ll feel better after that.’  \n‘Leave me alone! I don’t want to!’ Raskolnikov waved him off. He felt disgusted by Razumihin’s attempts to make light of his shopping.  \n‘Come on, brother, don’t tell me I’ve been running around for nothing,’ Razumihin insisted. ‘Nastasya, don’t be shy, help me out,’ and despite Raskolnikov’s resistance, he changed his linen. Raskolnikov sank back on the bed.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin presents Raskolnikov with a new set of clothes and insists on helping him despite his reluctance."
