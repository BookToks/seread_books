Sofya Semyonovna is not home. The Kapernaumovs are far away—there are five locked rooms between us. I am at least twice as strong as you, and I have nothing to fear. You wouldn’t want to betray your brother, would you? No one would believe you anyway. How could a girl visit a man alone in his place? Even if you tried to save your brother, you couldn’t prove anything. It’s very hard to prove an attack, Avdotya Romanovna.\"\n\n\"Scoundrel!\" Dounia whispered angrily.\n\n\"That’s your opinion, but remember I was just speaking generally. I believe you’re right—violence is terrible. I only said that to show you that you shouldn’t feel guilty if you decide to save your brother, as I suggest. You would just be accepting the situation, which is a kind of violence, if we must use that word. Think about it. Your brother’s and your mother’s futures are in your hands. I will be your servant… for life… I will wait here.\"\n\nSvidrigaïlov sat down on the sofa about eight steps from Dounia. She had no doubt about his strong will. She knew him well. Suddenly, she pulled a revolver out of her pocket, cocked it, and placed it on the table. Svidrigaïlov jumped up.\n\n\"Aha! So that’s what you’re doing?\" he exclaimed, surprised but smiling slyly. \"Well, that changes everything.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia confronts Svidrigaïlov about his threats, revealing her own readiness to defend herself with a revolver."
