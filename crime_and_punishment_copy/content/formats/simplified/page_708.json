  "text": "He thought, \"It's a mouse. That's the meat I left on the table.\" He really didn't want to get out of bed, but something unpleasant touched his leg again. He pulled off the blanket and lit a candle. Shaking with a cold chill, he looked at the bed: there was nothing there. He shook the blanket, and suddenly a mouse jumped out onto the sheet. He tried to catch it, but the mouse ran around in zigzags without leaving the bed, slipped through his fingers, ran over his hand, and then darted under the pillow. He threw down the pillow, but then he felt something jump on his chest and run down his back under his shirt. He shook nervously and woke up.\n\nThe room was dark. He was lying on the bed, wrapped in the blanket like before. The wind was howling outside the window. \"How disgusting,\" he thought, feeling annoyed. He got up and sat on the edge of the bed with his back to the window. \"It's better not to sleep at all,\" he decided. But there was a cold, damp draft from the window. Without getting up, he pulled the blanket over him and wrapped himself in it. He wasn't thinking about anything and didn't want to think. But different images kept popping into his mind, random thoughts without any order. He started to feel sleepy. Maybe it was the cold, the dampness, the dark, or the howling wind that made him crave something imaginative. He kept thinking about flowers, imagining a beautiful flower garden, a bright, warm day, a holidayâ€”Trinity day.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a restless night filled with unsettling thoughts and vivid images, reflecting his inner turmoil."
