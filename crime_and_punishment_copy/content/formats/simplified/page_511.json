  "text": "Andrey Semyonovitch had been home all morning. Pyotr Petrovitch had a strange, but maybe normal, feeling towards him. Pyotr Petrovitch had disliked and hated Andrey since he arrived, but he also seemed a bit scared of him. \n\nAndrey hadn’t come to stay with him just to save money, even though that was a big reason. Pyotr had heard about Andrey, who used to be under his care, as a young leader involved in important groups that were talked about in the provinces. This impressed Pyotr Petrovitch. These powerful groups, who looked down on everyone and exposed their flaws, made him feel uneasy. \n\nHe didn’t really understand what they were about. Like many people, he had heard there were progressives and nihilists in Petersburg, and he exaggerated the meaning of those terms. For years, he had been most afraid of being exposed, which made him anxious about moving his business to Petersburg. He was scared of this like little kids get scared. A few years earlier, when he was starting his career, he had seen two cases where important people in the province, who supported him, were badly exposed. One of those cases ended in a big scandal.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pyotr Petrovitch feels a mix of disdain and fear towards Andrey Semyonovitch, a progressive figure he perceives as a threat to his reputation."
