The priest lowered his head and said nothing.\n\nMarmeladov was suffering greatly; he couldn't take his eyes off Katerina Ivanovna, who was leaning over him again. He tried to say something to her but struggled to speak clearly. Katerina Ivanovna, realizing he wanted to ask for forgiveness, told him firmly, \"Be quiet! No need! I know what you want to say!\" He stopped talking, but at that moment, his eyes wandered to the doorway and he saw Sonia.\n\nHe hadn't noticed her before; she was standing quietly in the shadows. \"Who’s that? Who’s that?\" he suddenly gasped, looking shocked and trying to sit up.\n\n\"Lie down! Lie down!\" Katerina Ivanovna shouted. \n\nWith surprising strength, he managed to prop himself up on his elbow. He stared at his daughter for a long time, as if he didn't recognize her. He had never seen her dressed like this before. Suddenly, he recognized her, looking crushed and embarrassed in her fancy clothes, waiting to say goodbye to her dying father. His face showed deep pain.\n\n\"Sonia! Daughter! Forgive me!\" he cried, trying to reach out to her. But he lost his balance and fell off the sofa, landing face down on the floor. They rushed to lift him back onto the sofa, but he was dying. Sonia was there with him.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marmeladov, in his final moments, seeks forgiveness from his daughter Sonia while Katerina Ivanovna urges him to remain silent."
