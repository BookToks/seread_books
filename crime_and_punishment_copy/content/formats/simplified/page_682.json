  "text": "\"Let's hurry,\" Svidrigaïlov whispered to her. \"I don't want Rodion Romanovitch to know we're meeting. I have to tell you that I was just with him at a nearby restaurant, and it was hard to get rid of him. He somehow found out about my letter to you and thinks something is going on. It wasn’t you who told him, right? But if it wasn’t you, then who?\"\n\n\"Well, we've turned the corner now,\" Dounia interrupted. \"My brother won't see us. I need to tell you that I'm not going any further with you. You can talk to me here, in the street.\"\n\n\"First, I can't say it in the street. Second, you need to hear about Sofya Semyonovna too. And third, I have some papers to show you. If you won't come with me, I won't explain anything and I'll leave right away. But please remember, I know a very important secret about your brother.\"\n\nDounia stopped, unsure, and looked at Svidrigaïlov closely.\n\n\"What are you scared of?\" he said calmly. \"This town is different from the country. And even in the country, you caused me more trouble than I caused you.\"\n\n\"Have you talked to Sofya Semyonovna?\"\n\n\"No, I haven't said anything to her and I'm not sure if she's home right now. But she probably is. She just buried her stepmother today, so she’s not likely to be visiting anyone. For now, I don’t want to talk to anyone about this, and I kind of regret talking to you. The smallest mistake can be just as bad as betrayal in a situation like this.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov urges Dounia to meet him privately to discuss a secret about her brother, Raskolnikov, while she remains hesitant and insists on not going further with him."
