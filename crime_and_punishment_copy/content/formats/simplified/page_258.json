I told them to bring him here... I’ve been here before, remember? He will be okay; I’ll pay!\" \n\n“He’s really done it this time!” Katerina Ivanovna cried in despair and rushed to her husband. \n\nRaskolnikov noticed right away that she was not the type of woman who fainted easily. She quickly put a pillow under the unfortunate man’s head, which no one else thought to do, and started to undress and check him. She stayed focused, biting her trembling lips and holding back screams that wanted to come out. \n\nMeanwhile, Raskolnikov got someone to go get a doctor. There was a doctor next door. \n\n“I’ve called for a doctor,” he kept telling Katerina Ivanovna. “Don’t worry, I’ll pay. Do you have any water? And give me a napkin or towel, anything, as fast as you can. He is hurt, but not dead, trust me. We’ll see what the doctor says!” \n\nKaterina Ivanovna ran to the window. There, on a broken chair in the corner, was a big bowl full of water, ready for washing her children’s and husband’s clothes that night. Katerina Ivanovna did this washing at least twice a week, if not more. Their family was in such a bad place that they hardly had any clean clothes, and she couldn’t stand dirtiness.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna desperately tends to her injured husband after he is run over by a carriage, showing her resilience and determination amidst the chaos."
