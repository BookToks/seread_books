  "text": "It was hard for Katerina Ivanovna to understand, but did you know that in Paris, they have been trying serious experiments to cure crazy people just by using logical arguments? One professor there, who was a respected scientist and has recently died, thought this kind of treatment could work. He believed that nothing was really wrong with the bodies of insane people, and that insanity was like a logical mistake or a wrong way of thinking. He slowly showed the madman his mistakes, and believe it or not, they say he was successful. But since he also used water treatments, it's unclear how much of the success was due to that.\n\nRaskolnikov had stopped listening a long time ago. When he got to his house, he nodded to Lebeziatnikov and went through the gate. Lebeziatnikov woke up suddenly, looked around, and hurried on.\n\nRaskolnikov entered his small room and stood still in the middle of it. Why had he come back here? He looked at the yellow, worn-out paper, the dust, and his sofa. From the yard, he heard loud, continuous knocking; someone seemed to be hammering. He went to the window, stood on his tiptoes, and looked out into the yard for a long time, focused on what he was hearing. But the yard was empty, and he couldn't see who was hammering. In the house next door, he saw some open windows with pots of sickly-looking geraniums. Laundry was hanging out of the windows. He knew it all by heart. He turned away and sat down on the sofa.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reflects on the idea that insanity may stem from a logical error rather than a physical ailment, while feeling disconnected and absorbed in his own thoughts."
