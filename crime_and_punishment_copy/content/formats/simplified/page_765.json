She stood up and looked at him, shaking. But then she understood, and a look of great happiness filled her eyes. She knew he loved her more than anything, and the moment they had been waiting for had finally come.\n\nThey wanted to talk, but words wouldn’t come; tears filled their eyes. They were both pale and thin, but their sick faces shone with the hope of a new future and a fresh start. Love had renewed them; each of their hearts held endless love for the other.\n\nThey decided to wait and be patient. They had seven more years to wait, with both terrible suffering and great happiness ahead of them. But he felt like he had come back to life, and she lived only for him.\n\nThat evening, after the barracks were locked, Raskolnikov lay on his hard bed and thought about her. He even imagined that the other prisoners, who had once been his enemies, looked at him differently. He had talked to them, and they responded kindly. He remembered this and thought things must be changing.\n\nHe thought about her and how much he had hurt her before.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a profound emotional awakening and connection with a woman he loves, signaling hope for a renewed future despite their past suffering."
