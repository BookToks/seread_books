I won't go home without it because I can't keep living like this.\" He had no idea how to make it happen and didn't even want to think about it. He pushed away his thoughts because they were hurting him. All he knew was that everything had to change \"one way or another,\" he kept saying to himself with strong confidence and determination.\n\nOut of habit, he walked towards the Hay Market. A young man with dark hair was playing a sad song on a barrel organ in front of a small shop. He was with a fifteen-year-old girl who stood on the sidewalk. She was dressed in an old, worn-out crinoline, a mantle, and a straw hat with a bright feather. She sang in a strong but rough voice, hoping to get some money from the shop. Raskolnikov joined a few other listeners, took out a five copeck coin, and gave it to the girl. She suddenly stopped singing on a high note, yelled \"Come on\" to the organ grinder, and they both moved to the next shop.\n\n\"Do you like street music?\" Raskolnikov asked a middle-aged man who was standing nearby. The man looked at him, surprised and confused.  \n\"I love hearing singing to a street organ,\" Raskolnikov said.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, in a moment of calm determination, resolves that his life must change immediately, despite not knowing how to achieve it."
