  "text": "At the top of the stairs, it was dark, even though it was not really night. A dirty little door was slightly open. \n\nInside was a very poor-looking room about ten steps long, lit by a small candle. You could see everything from the entrance. The room was messy, filled with rags, especially children's clothes. In one corner, there was a torn sheet, likely hiding a bed. The only furniture was two chairs and a sofa made of old leather, which had many holes. There was also a simple kitchen table without paint or a tablecloth. On the table, there was a burning candle in a metal holder. \n\nIt seemed like this family had their own room, but it was more like a hallway. The door to other rooms was half open, and you could hear shouting, noise, and laughter coming from there. It sounded like people were playing cards and drinking tea, with some rude words being shouted occasionally.\n\nRaskolnikov immediately recognized Katerina Ivanovna. She was a tall and slim woman, very thin, with beautiful dark brown hair and red cheeks. She was walking back and forth in her small room, pressing her hands to her chest. Her lips were dry, and she was breathing in quick, shaky breaths. Her eyes shone like she was sick, and they looked around with a hard, fixed stare. Her pale and excited face was lit by the flickering candlelight.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov observes Katerina Ivanovna in her disordered, impoverished room, revealing her distress and deteriorating health."
