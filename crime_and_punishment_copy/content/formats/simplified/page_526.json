  "text": "Your late parent didn’t finish their job and hasn’t really worked for a while. If there’s any hope, it’s very small because there’s no reason for help in this case. And she is already dreaming about getting money from a pension, ha-ha! She’s quite ambitious!\n\n“Yes, she is. She believes everything because she’s kind-hearted. You have to forgive her,” said Sonia, and she got up to leave again.\n\n“But you haven’t heard what I want to say.”\n\n“No, I haven’t heard,” Sonia mumbled.\n\n“Then sit down.” She felt really embarrassed and sat down again.\n\n“Considering her situation with her little kids, I would like to help as much as I can. We could start a fundraiser or a lottery, like friends or even strangers do to help people in need. That’s what I wanted to talk to you about; it could be done.”\n\n“Yes, yes … God will reward you for it,” Sonia said, looking closely at Pyotr Petrovitch.\n\n“That might be true, but we can discuss it later. We could start today; let’s talk about it this evening and set things up. Come to me at seven o'clock. I hope Mr. Lebeziatnikov will help us. But there’s one thing I need to warn you about first…”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia expresses her confusion and concern about her family's financial situation while discussing potential assistance with Pyotr Petrovitch."
