He clearly saw the other as an expert.  \n“A fashion book has a lot of colorful pictures. They come to the tailors here every Saturday by mail from other countries. They show people how to dress, both men and women. The pictures usually show men in fur coats and women in fancy outfits that are hard to imagine.”  \n“There’s nothing you can’t find in Petersburg,” the younger one said excitedly. “Except for father and mother, there’s everything!”  \n“Except them, there’s everything to be found, my boy,” the older one said seriously.  \n\nRaskolnikov got up and walked into the other room where the strong box, bed, and chest of drawers used to be. The room felt very small without furniture. The wallpaper was the same; the corner showed where the case of icons had been. He looked at it and went to the window. The older workman watched him suspiciously.  \n“What do you want?” he suddenly asked.  \n\nInstead of answering, Raskolnikov went into the hallway and pulled the bell. It made the same cracked sound. He rang it a second and a third time; he listened and remembered. The terrible and frightening feeling he had felt before started to come back stronger. He shuddered with each ring, and it gave him more satisfaction.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a haunting mix of nostalgia and dread as he revisits a flat associated with a past crime."
