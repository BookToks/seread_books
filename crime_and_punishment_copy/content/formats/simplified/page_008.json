  "text": "On a very hot evening in July, a young man came out of his tiny room in S. Place and walked slowly toward K. bridge. He had avoided running into his landlady on the stairs. His room was under the roof of a tall, five-story building and felt more like a cupboard than a real room. The landlady lived on the floor below and took care of him, giving him meals and other help.\n\nThat evening, as he stepped outside, he suddenly felt very aware of his fears. \n\n\"I want to do something big, but I’m scared of these little things,\" he thought with a strange smile. \"Yes, everything is in a man’s hands, but he lets it go because he’s afraid. It would be interesting to know what men fear the most. They fear taking new steps and saying new things the most... But I’m talking too much. I do nothing because I talk. Or maybe I talk because I do nothing. I’ve learned to talk a lot this past month, lying in my room thinking about Jack the Giant-killer. Why am I going there now? Can I really do that? Is it serious? It’s not serious at all. It’s just a fantasy to entertain myself; just a toy! Yes, maybe it is a toy.\"\n\nThe heat in the street was unbearable. The stuffy air, the noise, and the dust all around him were hard on his already stressed nerves. The awful smell from the nearby bars, which were very common in that part of town, and the drunken men he kept seeing, even though it was a workday, added to his feeling of misery.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The young man grapples with his fears and insecurities while navigating a suffocating and unpleasant environment."
