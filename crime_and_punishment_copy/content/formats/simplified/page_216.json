Before, if someone told me to ‘love your neighbor,’ what happened? It meant I would tear my coat in half to share with my neighbor, and then we both ended up half naked. As a Russian saying goes, ‘If you try to catch many hares, you won’t catch any.’ Now science says to love yourself first, because everything is based on self-interest. If you take care of yourself and your own needs, your coat stays whole. Economic truth says that if people manage their own affairs well, there will be more whole coats, and society will be stronger and better off. So, by getting wealth just for myself, I’m also helping everyone else.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The conversation discusses the shift from altruism to self-interest as a means to achieve societal progress and welfare."
