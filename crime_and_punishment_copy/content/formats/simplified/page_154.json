Even if they were his own brothers and sisters, it would be impossible to ask them for help in any situation. He had never felt such a strange and terrible feeling. \n\nWhat made it worse was that this feeling was more about sensation than thoughts or ideas; it was the most painful feeling he had ever experienced. \n\nThe head clerk started telling him the usual things he needed to write down, like that he couldn't pay now, but would in the future, and that he wouldn't leave town or sell his things. \n\n\"But you can't write; you can barely hold the pen,\" the head clerk said, looking at Raskolnikov with curiosity. \"Are you sick?\" \n\n\"Yes, I feel dizzy. Keep going!\" \n\n\"That's it. Just sign here.\" \n\nThe head clerk took the paper and moved on to help others. Raskolnikov gave the pen back, but instead of getting up and leaving, he put his elbows on the table and pressed his head into his hands. It felt like a nail was being hammered into his skull. Suddenly, a strange idea popped into his mind.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences an intense and agonizing realization that he can no longer appeal to the police officers with emotional pleas, feeling a profound sense of isolation."
