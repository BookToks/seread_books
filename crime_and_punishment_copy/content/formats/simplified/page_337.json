It was Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov. He had seen her the day before, but now she looked very different.\n\nRaskolnikov felt sorry for her because she seemed so humiliated. When she looked like she wanted to leave in fear, it made his heart ache. \n\n“I didn’t expect you,” he said quickly, making her stop. “Please sit down. You must have come from Katerina Ivanovna. Sit here, not there…”\n\nWhen Sonia came in, Razumihin, who was sitting by the door, stood up to let her pass. Raskolnikov first pointed to a spot on the sofa where Zossimov had been sitting but then thought it was too familiar, so he quickly offered her Razumihin’s chair.\n\n“You sit here,” he said to Razumihin, moving him to the sofa.\n\nSonia sat down, almost trembling with fear, and looked nervously at the two ladies. It was hard for her to believe she could sit next to them. Just thinking about it made her so scared that she quickly stood up again and, feeling very embarrassed, spoke to Raskolnikov.\n\n“I… I… came for just a minute. I’m sorry to disturb you,” she said hesitantly. “I come from Katerina Ivanovna, and she had no one else to send. Katerina Ivanovna asked me to beg you… to be at the service… in the morning… at Mitrofanievsky… and then… to us… to her… to honor her… she asked me to beg you…” Sonia stumbled over her words and stopped.\n\n“I will try, certainly, most certainly,” Raskolnikov replied. He also stood up, feeling unsure and unable to finish his sentence.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels a sudden pang of sympathy for Sonia, who appears humiliated and terrified as she seeks his presence on behalf of Katerina Ivanovna."
