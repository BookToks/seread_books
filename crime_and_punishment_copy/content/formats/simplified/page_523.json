I’ll go now, and I promise I won’t get in your way.\"\n\nFive minutes later, Lebeziatnikov came in with Sonia. She looked surprised and shy as usual. She was always shy around new people, just like when she was a child, and it was even worse now. Pyotr Petrovitch greeted her politely but with a teasing tone that he thought was fitting for someone important talking to a young and interesting girl. He quickly tried to make her feel comfortable and had her sit down at the table across from him. \n\nSonia sat down, looked around at Lebeziatnikov, at the money on the table, and then back at Pyotr Petrovitch, her eyes focused on him. Lebeziatnikov was moving toward the door. Pyotr Petrovitch signaled for Sonia to stay seated and stopped Lebeziatnikov.\n\n\"Is Raskolnikov in there? Has he come?\" he asked quietly.\n\n\"Raskolnikov? Yes, he’s in there. I just saw him come in. Why?\" \n\n\"Well, I really need you to stay here with us and not leave me alone with this young woman. I only want to talk to her for a moment, but who knows what they might think of it. I wouldn’t want Raskolnikov to overhear anything. You understand what I mean?\" \n\n\"I understand!\" Lebeziatnikov got it. \"Yes, you are right.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pyotr Petrovitch expresses his desire to speak privately with Sonia while ensuring Raskolnikov does not overhear their conversation."
