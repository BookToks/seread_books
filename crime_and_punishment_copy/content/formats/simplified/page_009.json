  "text": "A look of deep disgust appeared on the young man’s handsome face. He was tall, slim, and well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon, he fell into deep thought, or more like, his mind went completely blank. He walked without noticing anything around him and didn’t care to look. Sometimes, he would mumble to himself, a habit he had just admitted to. During these times, he realized his thoughts were jumbled and that he felt very weak; he hadn’t eaten much in two days.\n\nHe was dressed so poorly that even someone used to shabby clothes would be embarrassed to be seen in public like that. However, in that part of town, no one would be surprised by bad clothing. Because the Hay Market was nearby and there were many shady places, the streets were full of different kinds of people, so no outfit, no matter how strange, would raise eyebrows. Still, the young man felt a lot of bitterness and disdain inside, so he cared less about his rags while walking on the street. It was different when he ran into acquaintances or former classmates, whom he really didn’t like seeing. But when a drunk man was being taken somewhere in a large wagon, he felt a mix of emotions.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The young man, despite his handsome appearance, is consumed by disgust and bitterness, reflecting on his dire circumstances and the rags he wears."
