  "text": "Certainly not insult, but protest. I would do it for a good reason. I might help spread knowledge and ideas. It's important for everyone to work for knowledge and ideas, and maybe being harsh is better. I might plant a seed, an idea, and something good could come from it. How would I be insulting them? They might be upset at first, but later they would see I was helping them.\n\nYou know, Terebyeva, who is part of the community now, was criticized because when she left her family, she told her parents she wouldn't live normally anymore and was starting a free marriage. People said that was too harsh and she should have been kinder in her letter. I think that’s silly; there’s no need to be soft. What’s needed is protest.\n\nVarents was married for seven years, left her two kids, and told her husband in a letter: \"I realized I can’t be happy with you. I can never forgive you for hiding from me that there is another way of living in communities. I just learned this from a great man I’m now with. I’m being honest because it’s wrong to deceive you. Do what you think is best. Don’t expect me back; it’s too late. I hope you find happiness.\" That’s how letters like that should be written! \n\n\"Is that Terebyeva the one you said had three free marriages?\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The text discusses the importance of protest and honesty in personal relationships, advocating for direct communication over softness."
