  "text": "He was sick for a long time. But it wasn't the terrible life in prison, the hard work, the bad food, the shaved head, or the patched clothes that brought him down. He didn't care about those struggles! In fact, he was even happy about the hard work. When he was physically tired, he could at least count on getting a few hours of peaceful sleep. And what did the food matter to himâ€”the thin cabbage soup with bugs in it? In the past, when he was a student, he often didn't even have that. His clothes were warm and fit his life there. He didn't even feel the chains on his feet. Was he ashamed of his shaved head and colorful coat? Who would he be ashamed in front of? Sonia? Sonia was scared of him; how could he feel ashamed in front of her? Still, he felt ashamed even before Sonia, whom he hurt with his rude behavior. But it wasn't really his shaved head or chains that made him feel ashamed; it was his wounded pride. It was his pride that made him sick. He would have been so happy if he could have blamed himself! He could have handled anything then, even shame and disgrace. But he judged himself harshly, and his troubled conscience found no serious mistake in his past, just a simple error that could happen to anyone. He felt ashamed simply because he, Raskolnikov, had messed up so badly due to some blind fate and had to lower himself.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's illness stems not from the hardships of prison life, but from his wounded pride and inability to accept his fate."
