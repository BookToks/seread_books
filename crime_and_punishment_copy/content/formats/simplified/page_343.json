You can believe it or not, but as soon as she came in, I felt she was the main reason for the trouble….’  \n‘That’s not true!’ Dounia said, annoyed. ‘That’s silly, mother! He only met her the night before and didn’t know her when she came in.’  \n‘Well, you’ll see…. She makes me uneasy; but you’ll see! I was so scared. She was looking at me with those eyes. I could hardly sit still when he started introducing her, do you remember? It seems strange, but Pyotr Petrovitch writes about her like that, and he introduces her to us—to you! So he must think a lot of her.’  \n‘People will write anything. They talked about us too. Have you forgotten? I’m sure she is a good girl, and it’s all nonsense.’  \n‘God grant it may be!’  \n‘And Pyotr Petrovitch is a terrible gossip,’ Dounia said sharply.  \nPulcheria Alexandrovna felt defeated; they didn’t continue the conversation.  \n*****  \n‘I will tell you what I want with you,’ Raskolnikov said, pulling Razumihin to the window.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pulcheria Alexandrovna expresses her concern that Sofya Semyonovna is the cause of their troubles, while Dounia dismisses her mother's presentiments as nonsense."
