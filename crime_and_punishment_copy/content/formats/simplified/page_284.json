  "text": "An hour earlier, when he was taking Raskolnikov home, he had talked a bit too much, but he knew it and still felt clear-headed despite drinking a lot. Now, he felt almost ecstatic, and everything he drank seemed to hit him harder. He stood with the two ladies, holding their hands, trying to convince them and explaining things very clearly. To make his point, he squeezed their hands tightly. He looked at Avdotya Romanovna without caring about manners. They sometimes pulled their hands away from him, but he just pulled them closer. If they had told him to jump down the stairs, he would have done it without thinking to help them.\n\nPulcheria Alexandrovna thought the young man was too strange and squeezed her hand too hard, but because she was worried about her son Rodya, she saw him as a blessing and ignored his odd behavior. Avdotya Romanovna also worried but wasn’t scared. She noticed the bright look in his eyes and felt surprised and a bit scared. Only the trust she had from Nastasya’s stories about her brother’s strange friend kept her from trying to escape and convincing her mother to do the same. She also realized that running away might not be possible now. However, ten minutes later, she felt much better; it was typical of Razumihin.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin, in a state of intoxicated ecstasy, fervently tries to persuade Avdotya and Pulcheria while displaying eccentric behavior that both intrigues and alarms them."
