Her eyes opened wide, giving him a daring look. They laughed and seemed to invite him in. There was something very disturbing about that laugh and those eyes, especially on a child's face. “What, at five years old?” Svidrigaïlov said in shock. “What does this mean?” Then she turned to him, her little face shining, reaching out her arms. “Cursed child!” Svidrigaïlov shouted, raising his hand to hit her, but he woke up at that moment.\n\nHe was still in bed, wrapped in his blanket. The candle was not lit, and sunlight was coming in through the windows. \n\n“I’ve had nightmares all night!” He got up angrily, feeling completely worn out; his body hurt. Outside, there was thick fog and he couldn’t see anything. It was almost five o'clock. He had overslept! He got dressed in his damp jacket and coat. He felt the revolver in his pocket, took it out, and sat down. He pulled out a notebook and wrote a few lines in big letters on the title page. After reading what he wrote, he rested his elbows on the table and thought. The revolver and the notebook were beside him. Some flies woke up and landed on the untouched veal still sitting on the table. He stared at them and then started trying to catch one with his free hand. He tried until he got tired, but he couldn’t catch any.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov wakes from a disturbing nightmare, feeling shattered and contemplating his next actions with a revolver and a notebook at hand."
