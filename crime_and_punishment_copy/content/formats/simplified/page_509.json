  "text": "The next morning, Pyotr Petrovitch faced one problem after another. He even found a setback in his legal case. He was especially annoyed with the owner of the flat he was renting for his upcoming marriage. The owner, a wealthy German businessman, refused to break the contract they had just signed and wanted all the money for breaking it, even though Pyotr Petrovitch would be returning the flat almost fully redecorated. The furniture store also wouldn't give back any of the money he had paid for furniture that hadn’t been moved to the flat yet.\n\n\"Am I really going to get married just for the furniture?\" Pyotr Petrovitch gritted his teeth, but he also felt a spark of desperate hope. \"Can it really be all over? Should I try again?\" The thought of Dounia made his heart ache. He felt pain at that moment, and if he could have wished Raskolnikov dead right then, he would have done it.\n\n\"It was my mistake not to give them money,\" he thought sadly as he walked back to Lebeziatnikov’s room. \"Why was I so stingy? That was a dumb move! I wanted to keep them without any money so they would depend on me, and look at them now! If I had spent about fifteen hundred roubles on their wedding things, like gifts, jewelry, and other stuff, I would be in a better situation.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pyotr Petrovitch grapples with the consequences of his failed engagement and the financial burdens that accompany it."
