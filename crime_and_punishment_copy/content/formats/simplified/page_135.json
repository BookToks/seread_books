Is this how to hide things?” \n\nHe hadn’t planned on hiding small items; he only thought about hiding money, so he didn’t make a hiding spot. “But now, what am I happy about?” he thought. “Is this really hiding things? I’m losing my mind!” \n\nHe sat down on the sofa, exhausted, and started to shiver again. Automatically, he grabbed his old winter coat from a chair. It was still warm, even though it was almost in rags. He wrapped himself in it and fell into a sleepy daze. He lost consciousness. \n\nJust five minutes later, he jumped up again and frantically grabbed his clothes. “How could I fall asleep again without doing anything? Yes, I forgot to take the loop off the armhole! I forgot something so important!” \n\nHe tore off the loop, quickly cut it into pieces, and hid the bits under his pillow with his linen. “Torn pieces of linen shouldn’t raise suspicion, no matter what happens; I hope not, I hope not!” he kept repeating, standing in the middle of the room. He looked around carefully, checking the floor and everywhere else, trying to make sure he hadn’t forgotten anything. He felt like he was losing control, even his memory.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist is consumed by paranoia and despair as he frantically attempts to hide evidence of his crime."
