  "text": "Pyotr Petrovitch was thinking about how he would react if Dounia took a lover soon after getting married. He liked hearing people praise him, so he accepted even the smallest compliments.\n\nThat morning, Pyotr Petrovitch had sold some bonds and was now sitting at the table counting stacks of cash. Andrey Semyonovitch, who rarely had any money, walked around the room pretending to ignore the cash, acting like he didn’t care. Pyotr Petrovitch couldn’t believe that Andrey really felt that way about the money. Meanwhile, Andrey bitterly thought that Pyotr was probably enjoying teasing him about their differences in wealth.\n\nAndrey found Pyotr to be very distracted and grumpy, even when he started talking about his favorite idea of creating a new community. Pyotr’s short comments, while counting on his beads, showed clear sarcasm. But Andrey thought Pyotr was upset because of his recent breakup with Dounia. He was eager to talk about it, believing he had some helpful ideas that could cheer up his friend and help him grow.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Andrey Semyonovitch struggles with feelings of inferiority and irritation while discussing progressive ideas with the self-absorbed Pyotr Petrovitch."
