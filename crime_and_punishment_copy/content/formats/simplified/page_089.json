Mikolka was furious that he couldn't kill her with one hit.\n\n\"She's tough,\" people shouted in the crowd. \n\n\"She'll fall soon, just wait,\" said one person watching. \n\n\"Get an axe! Finish her off!\" shouted another. \n\n\"I'll show you! Step back!\" Mikolka yelled, panicking. He threw down the stick, bent down in the cart, and picked up an iron crowbar. \"Watch out!\" he shouted, and with that...\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Mikolka violently beats a mare in front of a cheering crowd, demonstrating cruelty and indifference to suffering."
