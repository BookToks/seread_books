Razumihin kept stopping as they walked, excited and confused because they were finally talking openly about the issue. \n\n‘If you don’t believe it, then don’t!’ Raskolnikov replied with a cold, careless smile. ‘You didn’t notice anything as usual, but I was thinking carefully about every word.’ \n\n‘You’re being suspicious. That’s why you were analyzing their words… um… I agree, Porfiry’s tone was strange, and so was that guy Zametov! You’re right, there was something off about him—but why? Why?’ \n\n‘He has changed his mind since last night.’ \n\n‘On the contrary! If they had that silly idea, they would try hard to hide it and keep their plans secret to catch you later. But they were all bold and careless.’ \n\n‘If they had real facts—or at least some reason to be suspicious, they would definitely try to hide what they knew, hoping to get more information. They would have searched a long time ago otherwise. But they have no facts.’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin and Raskolnikov engage in a tense discussion about the implications of their recent encounters, reflecting on the strange behavior of Porfiry and Zametov."
