He watched them with interest but forgot about them quickly. \n\nAt one point, he stopped and counted his money. He had thirty copecks. He thought, “I gave twenty to the policeman, three to Nastasya for the letter, so I must have given forty-seven or fifty to the Marmeladovs yesterday.” He wasn’t sure why he was counting but soon forgot why he took the money out of his pocket. \n\nHe remembered when he passed a place to eat and realized he was hungry. He went into the tavern, drank a glass of vodka, and ate a pie. He finished eating as he walked away. It had been a long time since he drank vodka, and it affected him right away, even though he only had a little. His legs felt heavy, and he became very sleepy. \n\nHe headed home but stopped at Petrovsky Ostrov, feeling completely worn out. He stepped off the road into the bushes, sat down on the grass, and fell asleep right away. \n\nWhen someone’s mind is not well, dreams can feel very real and vivid. Sometimes strange images appear, but the dream looks so real and detailed that even a great artist couldn’t have made them up while awake. These troubling dreams stick in your mind and leave a strong impact on someone who is already stressed or unwell.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a vivid and heavy dream after drinking vodka, reflecting his troubled mental state."
