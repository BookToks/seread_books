  "text": "Raskolnikov was talking closely to Zametov, staring at him and whispering, which made Zametov shiver. \n\n\"This is what I should have done,\" Raskolnikov said. \"I would have taken the money and jewels, walked out, and gone to a quiet place where no one could see me, maybe a garden or something like that. I would find a heavy stone that’s been there since the house was built. I’d lift the stone, put the jewels and money in the hole underneath, then put the stone back so it looked the same. I wouldn’t touch it for a year or two, maybe three. They could search everywhere! There would be no evidence.\"\n\n\"You’re crazy,\" Zametov said, also whispering as he moved away from Raskolnikov, whose eyes were shining. Raskolnikov looked very pale, and his upper lip was twitching. He leaned in close to Zametov, and his lips moved without making any sound. This went on for about half a minute; he knew what he was doing but couldn’t stop himself. The awful word was about to come out, just like the latch on the door ready to open.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov contemplates a meticulous plan to conceal stolen money and jewels, revealing his inner turmoil and desperation."
