  "text": "I think you have been asleep for the last two or three days. I told you about this tavern myself, so it’s not surprising you came here. I explained how to get here and when you could find me. Do you remember?\n\n\"I don’t remember,\" Raskolnikov said, surprised.\n\n\"I believe you. I told you twice. The address is stuck in your memory. You turned this way without thinking, but you did it just as I said, even if you don’t realize it. When I told you, I didn’t really think you would understand. You show your feelings too much, Rodion Romanovitch. \n\nAlso, I’m sure there are many people in Petersburg who talk to themselves while walking. This city has a lot of strange people. If only we had scientists, doctors, and lawyers, they could do important studies here. There aren’t many places with such strong and odd effects on people as Petersburg. The weather affects people a lot. It’s the main city of Russia, and its mood must influence the whole country. But that’s not important right now. \n\nThe main thing is that I’ve watched you several times. You walk out of your house with your head held high, but after about twenty steps, you lower it and put your hands behind your back. You look around but don’t really see anything. Then you start talking to yourself, sometimes waving your hand and acting like you’re giving a speech, and you even stop in the middle of the street. That’s not normal.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's mechanical behavior and introspective nature are observed and commented on by Svidrigaïlov, highlighting the psychological impact of Petersburg's environment."
