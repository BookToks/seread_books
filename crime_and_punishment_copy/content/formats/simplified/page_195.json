  "text": "‘What is he?’  \n‘He’s been stuck in the same job as a district postmaster for his whole life and gets a small pension. He’s sixty-five—not worth talking about. But I like him. Porfiry Petrovitch is the head of the Investigation Department here… but you know him.’  \n‘Is he a relative of yours too?’  \n‘A very distant one. But why are you frowning? Just because you had a fight once, won’t you come then?’  \n‘I don’t care about him at all.’  \n‘That’s even better. There will be some students, a teacher, a government clerk, a musician, an officer, and Zametov.’  \n‘Please tell me what you or he’—Zossimov nodded at Raskolnikov—‘can have in common with this Zametov?’  \n‘Oh, you special gentlemen! Principles! You are driven by principles, like springs; you won’t act on your own. If a man is nice, that’s the only principle I follow. Zametov is a great person.’  \n‘Even though he takes bribes.’  \n‘Well, he does! So what? I don’t care if he takes bribes,’ Razumihin said with unusual annoyance. ‘I’m not saying he’s good for taking bribes. I just think he’s a nice guy in his own way! But if you look at people in every way—are there many good ones left? I’m sure I wouldn’t be worth much myself… maybe with you included.’  \n‘That’s too little; I’d give two for you.’  \n‘And I wouldn’t give more than one for you. No more.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin defends Zametov's character despite his flaws, emphasizing the importance of personal connections over rigid principles."
