  "text": "At first, Raskolnikov looked away and mumbled, thinking it was better to keep talking. \n\n“She isn’t, is she?” Razumihin asked, happy to get a response. “But she isn’t very smart either, right? She’s a really strange person! I sometimes don’t know what to think. She says she’s thirty-six, but she must be around forty. She can say what she wants. I judge her based on how she thinks, and there’s something strange between us, like a puzzle I can’t solve! \n\nBut that’s all silly. Since you’re not a student anymore and have lost your lessons and clothes, and because the young lady died, she doesn’t have to treat you like family. She got scared, and since you’ve been hiding away and cut off your ties with her, she wanted to get rid of you. She’s been thinking about this for a long time but didn’t want to lose the I O U because you told her your mother would pay it.\n\n“It was wrong of me to say that. My mother is almost poor, and I lied to keep my place and food,” Raskolnikov said clearly. \n\n“Yes, you did the smart thing. But the problem is that Mr. Tchebarov, a businessman, showed up. Pashenka would never have thought of doing anything herself; she’s too shy. But the businessman isn’t shy at all, and he first asks, ‘Is there any hope of getting the I O U back?’ The answer is yes.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reflects on his deceit regarding his mother's financial situation and the implications it has on his relationships."
