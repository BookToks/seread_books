  "text": "**Crime and Punishment**  \n**Chapter VII**\n\nThat same day, around seven o'clock in the evening, Raskolnikov was on his way to visit his mother and sister. They were staying in a house that Razumihin had found for them. \n\nHe walked slowly up the stairs, unsure if he should go or not. But he was determined to continue. \n\n\"Besides, it doesn't matter, they still don’t know anything,\" he thought. \"They are used to thinking of me as strange.\" \n\nHe looked terrible: his clothes were torn and dirty, soaked from the rain the night before. His face showed how tired and worn out he was from not sleeping and the inner struggle he had been facing for the last day. But he had made up his mind. \n\nHe knocked on the door, and his mother opened it. Dounia was not home, and even the servant was out. At first, Pulcheria Alexandrovna was so happy and surprised that she couldn’t speak. Then she took his hand and pulled him into the room. \n\n\"Here you are!\" she said, her voice shaking with joy. \"Don’t be mad at me, Rodya, for greeting you with tears. I’m laughing, not crying! Did you think I was crying? No, I’m so happy, but I’ve gotten into this silly habit of crying.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, despite his disheveled appearance and inner turmoil, decides to visit his mother and sister, who are unaware of his struggles."
