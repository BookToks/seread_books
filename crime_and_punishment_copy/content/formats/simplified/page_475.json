  "text": "Raskolnikov noticed that Porfiry Petrovitch was not embarrassed earlier. He realized he might have walked into a trap and that there was something he didn’t know. He felt like something was about to happen.\n\nHe stood up, took his cap, and spoke firmly, though he was irritated. “Porfiry Petrovitch,” he said, “yesterday you wanted me to come for some questions.” He emphasized the word “questions.” “I’m here now, so if you have questions, ask me. If not, let me leave. I don’t have time. I need to go to the funeral of the man who was run over, the one you know about,” he added, feeling angry for mentioning it. “I’m tired of all this, do you understand? I’ve been tired for a long time. It’s part of why I’m not well. So, please, either ask me your questions or let me go right now. If you have to ask me, do it properly. I won’t let you do it any other way. So, goodbye, since we clearly have nothing to talk about.”\n\n“What do you mean? What should I ask you about?” Porfiry Petrovitch said, suddenly serious and stopping his laughter. “Please don’t worry,” he said, moving around and trying to get Raskolnikov to sit down. “There’s no rush, there’s no hurry.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels trapped and irritated during a tense encounter with Porfiry Petrovitch, who seems to have ulterior motives for their meeting."
