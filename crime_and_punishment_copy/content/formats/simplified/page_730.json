  "text": "When he entered Sonia's room, it was getting dark. Sonia had been waiting all day for him, feeling very anxious. Dounia was there with her. She had visited Sonia that morning because she remembered what Svidrigaïlov had said about Sonia knowing something. We won't talk about their conversation and tears, but they became close friends. At least Dounia felt better knowing her brother wouldn’t be alone.\n\nAs the sun set, Sonia stood by the window, feeling sad. All she could see was the plain wall of the next building. Just when she started to fear for his life, he walked in.\n\nShe cried out in joy, but when she looked closely at his face, she turned pale.\n\n“Yes,” Raskolnikov said, smiling. “I came for your cross, Sonia. You told me to go to the crossroads; why are you scared now that it’s happening?”\n\nSonia stared at him in surprise. His voice sounded strange, and she felt a chill. But soon she realized he was hiding his true feelings. He spoke while looking away, as if he didn’t want to meet her eyes.\n\n“You see, Sonia, I’ve decided this is better. There’s one thing… but it’s a long story, and we don’t need to talk about it. What annoys me is that all those stupid faces will be staring at me, asking dumb questions that I’ll have to answer. They’ll point at me… Ugh! I’m not going to Porfiry; I’m tired of him. I’d rather go to my friend, the Explosive Lieutenant.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov visits Sonia, expressing his decision to confront his fate while revealing his inner turmoil and disdain for societal judgment."
