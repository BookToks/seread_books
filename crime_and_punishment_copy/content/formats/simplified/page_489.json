If you were really a criminal, or involved in this terrible situation, would you insist that you were not out of your mind but completely sane? And would you say it so strongly and often? I think it would be impossible. If you had a guilty conscience, you should say you were out of your mind. Isn’t that true?”\n\nThere was a sneaky tone in this question. Raskolnikov leaned back on the sofa as Porfiry leaned over him, looking at him in confusion.\n\n“Another thing about Razumihin—you should have said he came on his own to hide your role in it! But you don’t hide it! You emphasize that he came because you asked him to.”\n\nRaskolnikov hadn’t done that. He felt a chill run down his back.\n\n“You’re lying,” he said slowly and weakly, forcing a sickly smile. “You’re trying to show that you know everything I’m up to, that you can guess what I’ll say next,” he said, realizing he wasn’t choosing his words carefully. “You want to scare me… or you’re just making fun of me…”\n\nHe kept staring at him as he spoke, and there was a strong hatred in his eyes.\n\n“You keep lying,” he said. “You know very well that the best way for a criminal is to tell the truth as much as possible… to hide as little as possible. I don’t believe you!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov struggles with his guilt and paranoia as Porfiry questions his honesty regarding his involvement in a crime."
