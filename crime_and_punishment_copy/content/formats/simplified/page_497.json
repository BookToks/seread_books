Porfiry Petrovitch thought for a moment, then waved away the people who were not invited. They quickly left and shut the door. After that, he looked at Raskolnikov, who was in the corner, staring at Nikolay. He moved toward Raskolnikov but then stopped, looking back and forth between Nikolay and Raskolnikov, and then suddenly ran at Nikolay.\n\n\"You’re rushing things,\" he shouted at him, almost angrily. \"I didn’t ask what happened. Did you kill them?\" \n\n\"I am the murderer. I want to confess,\" Nikolay said. \n\n\"What did you use to kill them?\" \n\n\"An axe. I had it ready.\" \n\n\"Wow, you’re in a hurry! Did you do it alone?\" \n\nNikolay didn’t understand the question. \n\n\"Did you do it by yourself?\" \n\n\"Yes, alone. And Mitka is not guilty and had nothing to do with it.\" \n\n\"Don’t rush to defend Mitka! How come you ran downstairs like that? The porters saw both of you!\" \n\n\"I did it to throw them off. I ran after Mitka,\" Nikolay answered quickly, as if he had practiced it.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Nikolay confesses to being the murderer, claiming he acted alone with an axe."
