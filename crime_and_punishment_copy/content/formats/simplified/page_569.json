  "text": "Raskolnikov had been a strong supporter of Sonia against Luzhin, even though he was feeling a lot of pain and fear inside. After everything that happened in the morning, he felt a bit better by focusing on something else, besides his strong desire to protect Sonia. He was also nervous about talking to Sonia soon because he had to tell her who killed Lizaveta. He knew this would hurt him deeply, so he tried not to think about it.\n\nAs he left Katerina Ivanovna’s, he shouted, “Well, Sofya Semyonovna, we’ll see what you’ll say now!” He still felt excited and strong from winning against Luzhin. But by the time he got to Sonia’s place, he suddenly felt weak and scared. He stopped at the door, wondering if he really had to tell her who killed Lizaveta. It was a strange thought because he felt he had to tell her right away, and he couldn't delay it. He didn't understand why it had to be this way; he just felt it, and the overwhelming feeling of helplessness almost crushed him. To end his hesitation and pain, he quickly opened the door and looked at Sonia from the doorway. She was sitting there.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, despite his own anguish, feels compelled to confront Sonia with the truth about Lizaveta's murder."
