Raskolnikov lost his cool and almost made a big mistake.  \n\nHe was worried the old woman would be scared since they were alone, and he didn’t think seeing him would make her trust him. So, he grabbed the door and pulled it towards him to stop her from closing it again. She didn’t pull the door back, but she held onto the handle, which almost made him pull her out onto the stairs.  \n\nSince she was blocking the doorway, he moved right toward her. She stepped back in fear, tried to say something, but couldn’t speak and just stared at him with wide eyes.  \n\n“Good evening, Alyona Ivanovna,” he started, trying to sound relaxed, but his voice shook. “I have come… I brought something… but we should go inside… to the light…”  \n\nLeaving her behind, he walked straight into the room without being invited. The old woman quickly followed him, now able to speak.  \n\n“Good heavens! What is this? Who are you? What do you want?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confronts the old woman, Alyona Ivanovna, in a tense and suspicious encounter as he enters her room uninvited."
