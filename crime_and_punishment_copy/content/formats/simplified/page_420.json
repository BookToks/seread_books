Then he frowned and stayed quiet. \n\nPyotr Petrovitch was the kind of person who seemed very polite in public but got really upset if things didn’t go his way. When that happened, he acted more like a sack of flour than a lively person. \n\nThe room fell silent again. Raskolnikov wouldn’t speak, and Avdotya Romanovna didn’t want to start talking too soon. Razumihin had nothing to say, so Pulcheria Alexandrovna felt nervous again. \n\n\"Have you heard that Marfa Petrovna is dead?\" she started, trying to bring up a topic. \n\n\"Yes, I heard. I was told right away. I came to let you know that Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov rushed to Petersburg right after his wife’s funeral. I believe this from a good source,\" he replied. \n\n\"To Petersburg?
