  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nI don’t understand why mother is so hopeful. She says, “I will refuse,” but who is she counting on? Is she thinking about the small amount of money left from her pension after paying off Afanasy Ivanovitch’s debt? She knits shawls and embroiders cuffs, which is hard on her old eyes. All her work only brings in about twenty roubles a year on top of her hundred and twenty. So, she is really depending on Mr. Luzhin’s kindness; she thinks he will offer help on his own. Good luck with that! \n\nThis is typical for people with noble hearts; they always see the best in others until the very end. They ignore the bad signs, even when they suspect something is wrong. They refuse to accept the truth until they have to, and just thinking about it makes them uneasy. They push the truth away until the person they admire reveals their true self. \n\nI wonder if Mr. Luzhin has any medals. I bet he wears one when he dines with important people. He will probably wear it at his wedding too! Enough about him, I can’t stand it! \n\nI can understand why mother thinks this way; it’s just like her, bless her. But how could Dounia feel the same? Dounia, my dear, I know you well. You were almost twenty when I last saw you, and I understood you then. Mother writes that “Dounia can put up with a lot.” I know that too. I’ve been thinking about it for the past two and a half years.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The narrator expresses skepticism about Dounia's engagement to Mr. Luzhin, doubting his generosity and questioning her ability to endure his character."
