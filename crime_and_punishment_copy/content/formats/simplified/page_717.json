  "text": "I’ve been crying a lot since your father died. I cry over everything. Sit down, dear boy; you must be tired. I can see you are. Oh, you’re so muddy.\n\n“I was in the rain yesterday, mother…,” Raskolnikov started.\n\n“No, no,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna quickly interrupted. “You thought I was going to ask you a lot of questions like I used to. Don’t worry, I understand it all now. I see that things are better here. I’ve decided that I can’t understand your plans or expect you to explain them to me. Who knows what worries or ideas you have? It’s not my place to keep asking you what you’re thinking about. But why am I running around like I’m crazy? \n\nI’m reading your article in the magazine for the third time, Rodya. Dmitri Prokofitch brought it to me. When I saw it, I thought, ‘There, silly me, that’s what he’s been working on; that’s the answer to the mystery!’ Smart people are always like that. You might have some new ideas right now, and I don’t want to bother you and make you anxious. I read it, my dear, and of course, there was a lot I didn’t understand, but that’s normal—how could I?\n\n“Show me, mother.” \n\nRaskolnikov took the magazine and looked at his article. Even though it didn’t match his feelings and situation, he felt a strange mix of bitterness and sweetness.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's mother expresses her understanding of his complex thoughts and plans while reflecting on her emotional state since his father's death."
