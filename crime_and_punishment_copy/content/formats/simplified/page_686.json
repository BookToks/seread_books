  "text": "\"You’ve just seen him. What did you think of him?\"  \n\"Is that the only thing you are going by?\"  \n\"No, not just that, but also what he said. He came here two nights in a row to see Sofya Semyonovna. I showed you where they sat. He told her everything. He is a murderer. He killed an old woman, a pawnbroker, who he had pawned things to. He also killed her sister, a pedlar named Lizaveta, who walked in while he was killing the old woman. He used an axe he brought with him. He murdered them to steal from them, and he did steal. He took money and other things… He told Sofya Semyonovna all of this, and she is the only one who knows his secret. But she didn't help him in any way; she was just as shocked as you are now. Don't worry, she won't tell anyone.\"  \n\"It can't be,\" Dounia muttered, her lips pale. She struggled to breathe. \"It can't be. There was no reason for it… It's a lie, a lie!\"  \n\"He robbed her, that was the reason. He took money and things. He said he didn't use the money or things, but hid them under a stone, where they are now. But he didn’t use them because he was too scared.\"  \n\"But how could he steal, rob? How could he even think of it?\" Dounia cried, jumping up from her chair. \"You know him, and you’ve seen him. Can he really be a thief?\"  \nShe seemed to be begging Svidrigaïlov, completely forgetting her fear.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia is horrified to learn that a man she knows has confessed to murdering a pawnbroker and her sister for robbery."
