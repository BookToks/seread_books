Katia showed up and sang another sad song about how a \"bad guy and bully started kissing Katia.\"\n\nSvidrigaïlov bought drinks for Katia, the organ-grinder, some singers, the waiters, and two young clerks. He was especially interested in the clerks because they both had crooked noses—one bent to the left and the other to the right. They eventually took him to a small amusement garden, where he paid for their entrance. \n\nIn the garden, there was a tall, thin three-year-old pine tree and three bushes, along with a \"Vauxhall,\" which was really a bar that also served tea. There were a few green tables and chairs around. A group of sad singers and a drunk but very unhappy German clown from Munich with a red nose entertained the crowd. The clerks got into an argument with some other clerks, and it looked like a fight might break out. Svidrigaïlov was asked to help settle the argument. He listened to them for a while, but they were shouting so much that he couldn't understand anything. The only clear thing was that one of them had stolen something and had even sold it right there to a Jewish man, but he didn't want to share the money with his friend. In the end, it turned out that the stolen item was a teaspoon.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov spends the evening in low establishments, engaging with various characters and witnessing a brewing conflict among clerks."
