  "text": "Raskolnikov and Razumihin were outside at night. \n\n“Will you take it?” Razumihin asked, holding out a powder. \n\n“Two, if you want,” Raskolnikov replied, and he took the powder right away. \n\n“It’s good you’re taking him home,” Zossimov said to Razumihin. “We’ll see how he is tomorrow. He’s better today than he was this afternoon. You learn as you go…” \n\n“Do you know what Zossimov whispered to me when we were leaving?” Razumihin said as soon as they were outside. “I won’t tell you everything because they’re such fools. Zossimov told me to talk to you on the way and get you to talk to me, and then I have to tell him what we talked about. He thinks you’re… mad or close to it. Can you believe that? First, you’re way smarter than him. Second, if you’re not mad, you shouldn’t care what he thinks. And third, that doctor who focuses on surgery has gone crazy about mental illnesses. He thinks you’re strange because of your talk with Zametov today.” \n\n“Did Zametov tell you everything?” \n\n“Yes, and he did the right thing. Now I get it, and so does Zametov. The thing is, Rodya… I’m a little drunk right now… but that doesn’t matter. The idea… you understand? was just starting to form in their heads. No one wanted to say it out loud because it’s too silly, especially after that painter got arrested.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's mental state is under scrutiny by his friends, who suspect he may be mad due to his recent behavior and conversations."
