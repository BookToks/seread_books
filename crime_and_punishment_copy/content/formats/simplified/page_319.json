You’re feeling sentimental today, aren’t you?” Razumihin shouted.\n\nIf he had looked closer, he would have seen that Raskolnikov wasn’t being sentimental at all; it was something very different. But Avdotya Romanovna noticed. She was watching her brother carefully and with worry.\n\n“As for you, mother, I don’t want to say anything,” he continued, like he was repeating something he had learned. “Today, I can finally understand how worried you must have been waiting for me to come back yesterday.”\n\nAfter saying this, he suddenly reached out his hand to his sister, smiling without saying anything. But his smile showed real feelings. Dounia noticed it right away and warmly took his hand, feeling happy and thankful. It was the first time he had talked to her since their fight the day before. The mother’s face lit up with joy at this silent reconciliation. “Yes, that’s what I love about him,” Razumihin thought to himself, exaggerating a bit as he shifted in his chair. “He has these moments.”\n\n“And he does it so well,” the mother thought. “He has such kind feelings, and he expresses them so simply.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's gesture of reconciliation with his sister reveals his underlying emotional turmoil and the complexity of familial relationships."
