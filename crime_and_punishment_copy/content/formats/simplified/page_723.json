I’m really tired, and I wish I could control myself right now.” \n\nHe looked at her with suspicion. \n\n“Where were you all night?” she asked. \n\n“I don’t remember clearly. I wanted to make a decision for good, and I walked by the Neva River several times. I thought about ending everything there, but I couldn’t decide,” he whispered, glancing at her suspiciously again.\n\n“Thank God! That’s what we were worried about, Sofya Semyonovna and I. So you still believe in life? Thank God!” \n\nRaskolnikov smiled bitterly. \n\n“I don’t believe, but I just cried in mother’s arms. I don’t believe, but I asked her to pray for me.

Did you tell her?” Dounia asked, shocked. “You didn’t say that, did you?” \n\n“No, I didn’t tell her in words, but she understood a lot. She heard you talking in your sleep. I’m sure she understands some of it already. Maybe I was wrong to go…”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses his exhaustion and inner turmoil to his sister Dounia, revealing his struggle with despair and the contemplation of ending his life."
