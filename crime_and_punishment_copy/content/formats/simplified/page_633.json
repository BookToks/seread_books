A mood can really change how we see things! Mr. Razumihin—ah, that stone where things were hidden! I can picture it in a kitchen garden. You told Zametov about it, and then you mentioned it in my office. When we started breaking down your article, you explained it in a way that could mean two different things, like there was a hidden meaning.\n\n“So, Rodion Romanovitch, I reached my limit, and after hitting my head against a post, I asked myself what I was doing.
