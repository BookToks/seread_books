  "text": "Rodya wanted to open the letter alone, so he waited until Nastasya left. He quickly kissed the letter and looked closely at the address, written in his mother’s familiar handwriting, which he loved. He hesitated, almost scared, but finally opened it. The letter was thick and heavy, with small writing on two big sheets of paper.\n\n“Dear Rodya,” his mother wrote, “it’s been two months since I last wrote to you, and that has worried me and kept me awake at night. I hope you don’t blame me for not writing sooner. You know how much I love you; you are all we have, Dounia and I. You are our only hope. I was so sad to hear that you left the university a few months ago because you couldn’t afford to stay and that you lost your lessons and other work! How could I help you with my small pension of one hundred and twenty roubles a year? The fifteen roubles I sent you four months ago were borrowed from Vassily Ivanovitch Vahrushin, a kind man and a friend of your father. I had to let him take my pension to pay off the debt, which has only just been settled, so I couldn’t send you anything until now. But thank God, I think I can send you something more soon, and we can be happy about our good luck now.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Rodya's mother expresses her deep concern for him and their family's struggles while conveying hope for better times ahead."
