I want to leave.”\n\n“Of course, of course. Your sister, Avdotya Romanovna, is going to marry Mr. Luzhin, Pyotr Petrovitch?”\n\n“Can you please not talk about my sister or mention her name? I don’t understand how you can say her name in front of me if you really are Svidrigaïlov.”\n\n“Well, I came here to talk about her; how can I avoid mentioning her?”\n\n“Fine, go ahead, but be quick.”\n\n“I’m sure you have your own thoughts about Mr. Luzhin, who is related to me through my wife. Even if you’ve only seen him for a short time, or heard some facts about him, he is not good enough for Avdotya Romanovna. I believe she is giving up too much for her family. I thought you would be happy if the engagement could end without losing anything important. Now that I know you, I believe that.”\n\n“All this is very naïve… I should say it’s rude of you,” Raskolnikov replied.\n\n“You think I’m trying to benefit myself. Don’t worry, Rodion Romanovitch, if I were looking out for myself, I wouldn’t have spoken so openly.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confronts Svidrigaïlov about his intentions regarding his sister's marriage to Luzhin, expressing irritation and skepticism about Svidrigaïlov's motives."
