After that, he spent a long time carefully looking at the axe by the window. There were no marks on it, but the wood was still wet. He carefully hid the axe under his coat. \n\nNext, in the dim light of the kitchen, he checked his overcoat, pants, and boots. At first, he only saw stains on the boots. He wet a rag and scrubbed them, but he knew he wasn't checking closely enough. There might be something obvious that he was missing. He stood in the middle of the room, deep in thought. Dark, painful thoughts filled his mind—he worried that he was going crazy and that he wasn't thinking clearly enough to protect himself. He felt he should be doing something completely different from what he was doing. “Good God!” he whispered, “I have to get away,” and he rushed to the entryway.\n\nBut there, he was hit with a fear he had never felt before. He stood still, unable to believe what he saw: the outer door from the stairs, which he had rung not long ago, was wide open, about six inches. There was no lock or bolt—it had been open the whole time! The old woman must not have shut it after him, maybe as a safety measure. But, oh no! He had seen Lizaveta afterward! How could he not realize that she must have come in somehow? She couldn't have come through the wall! \n\nHe ran to the door and locked it.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, consumed by fear and guilt after committing murder, frantically cleans the evidence and realizes the door he thought was secure is wide open, heightening his terror."
