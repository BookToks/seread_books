  "text": "\"I don’t know.... I know nothing about it,\" Sonia said quietly at last.\n\n\"No, you know nothing?\" Luzhin repeated, pausing for a few seconds. \"Think for a moment, miss,\" he said seriously, almost warning her. \"Take your time to consider this. Please understand: if I weren't so sure, I wouldn't directly accuse you like this. If my accusation is wrong, I could be held responsible for it, and I know that. \n\nThis morning, I changed some investments for about three thousand roubles. I wrote it down in my notebook. When I got home, I counted the money—Mr. Lebeziatnikov can confirm this—and after counting two thousand three hundred roubles, I put the rest in my coat pocket. About five hundred roubles were left on the table, including three notes of a hundred roubles each. At that moment, you came in (because I invited you)—and while you were there, you looked very nervous; you even tried to leave three times in the middle of our conversation. Mr. Lebeziatnikov can confirm this too. You probably won’t deny that I invited you through Mr. Lebeziatnikov just to talk about the difficult situation of your relative, Katerina Ivanovna (whose dinner I couldn’t attend), and whether we should organize help for her.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Luzhin accuses Sonia of theft, asserting that her embarrassment during their conversation indicates guilt."
