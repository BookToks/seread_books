  "text": "When he thought about whether crime is caused by something or if it always feels like a sickness, he couldn't decide. \n\nHe believed that in his case, he wouldn't feel sick, and that his mind and will would be strong when he carried out his plan because he thought his plan was \"not a crime.\" We won't go into how he reached this conclusion; we've already gone too far ahead. \n\nThe practical problems of his plan were not his main concern. He thought that if he used all his willpower and reason, he could handle them once he understood all the details. But he never really started preparing. His final decisions were the ones he trusted the least, and when the moment came, things happened differently than he expected. \n\nA small thing messed up his plans before he even left the stairs. When he got to the landlady's kitchen, which was usually open, he looked in to see if the landlady was there or if her door was closed so she wouldn't see him go in for the axe. To his surprise, he found Nastasya in the kitchen, taking clothes out of a basket and hanging them up. When she saw him, she stopped hanging the clothes, turned to him, and stared.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist grapples with the moral implications of his planned crime, believing his reasoning will remain intact, but is ultimately thrown off by an unexpected encounter."
