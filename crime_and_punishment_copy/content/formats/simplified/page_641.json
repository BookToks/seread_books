  "text": "\"I can’t tell you everything. And why do you ask what the advantage is? Don’t you see how it could reduce your sentence? You would confess when another man has taken the blame, which would confuse the whole case. Think about it! I promise before God that your confession will come as a surprise. We will clear away all doubts about you, so your crime will seem like a mistake, because it really was a mistake. I am an honest man, Rodion Romanovitch, and I will keep my promise.\"\n\nRaskolnikov stayed quiet and looked sad. He thought for a long time and finally smiled, but it was a sad smile. \n\n\"No!\" he said, giving up on trying to impress Porfiry. \"It’s not worth it; I don’t care about reducing my sentence!\"\n\n\"That’s what I was worried about!\" Porfiry said, sounding warm and a bit surprised. \"I was afraid you wouldn’t care about a lighter sentence.\"\n\nRaskolnikov looked at him sadly. \n\n\"Ah, don’t look down on life!\" Porfiry said. \"You still have a lot of it ahead of you. How can you say you don’t want a lighter sentence? You are too impatient!\"\n\n\"A lot of what is ahead of me?\" \n\n\"Of life. What do you know about it? Look for answers and you will find them. This might be God’s way of guiding you. And it won’t last forever, this struggle….\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry encourages Raskolnikov to confess, suggesting it could lessen his sentence and lead to redemption, but Raskolnikov expresses indifference towards mitigating his punishment."
