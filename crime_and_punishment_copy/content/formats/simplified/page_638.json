You are the murderer.\" \n\nRaskolnikov jumped up from the sofa, stood for a moment, and then sat back down without saying anything. His face twitched.\n\nPorfiry noticed, \"Your lip is twitching like it did before. I think you misunderstood me, Rodion Romanovitch. That's why you're so shocked. I came to tell you everything and be honest with you.\"\n\n\"It wasn't me who killed her,\" Raskolnikov whispered like a scared child caught doing something wrong.\n\n\"Yes, it was you, Rodion Romanovitch, and no one else,\" Porfiry said firmly.\n\nThey both went silent for a strangely long time, about ten minutes. Raskolnikov rested his elbow on the table and ran his fingers through his hair. Porfiry sat quietly, waiting. Suddenly, Raskolnikov looked at Porfiry with disdain.\n\n\"You're using your old tricks again, Porfiry Petrovitch! Your same method. I wonder how you donâ€™t get tired of it!\"\n\n\"Oh, come on, what does that matter now? It would be different if there were witnesses, but we're alone and whispering. You see that I haven't come to catch you like a rabbit. Whether you confess or not doesn't matter to me now; I'm already convinced.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry Petrovtich confronts Raskolnikov with the conviction that he is the murderer, leading to a tense and silent exchange between them."
