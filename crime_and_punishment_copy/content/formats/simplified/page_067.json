  "text": "Dounia can handle a lot. If she can deal with Mr. Svidrigaïlov and everything else, she can handle Mr. Luzhin too. He believes that wives who come from nothing owe everything to their husbands, and he mentions this almost right away. Maybe he didn’t mean to say it so openly, but he’s smart, so he might have wanted to be clear from the start.\n\nDounia understands him, but she has to live with him. She would rather eat plain bread and water than give up her soul or trade her freedom for comfort. She wouldn’t trade it for anything, not even for a lot of money. I know Dounia well, and she hasn’t changed. \n\nThe Svidrigaïlovs are really hard to deal with. It’s tough to be a governess in the provinces for just two hundred roubles, but Dounia would prefer any hard job rather than lose her dignity by marrying a man she doesn’t respect just for her own benefit. Even if Mr. Luzhin were made of gold or a giant diamond, she wouldn’t agree to be with him.\n\nSo why is she considering it? The answer is clear: for herself, she wouldn’t sell out, but for someone else, she is willing to do it.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia refuses to sacrifice her moral freedom for personal comfort, yet considers compromising her values for the sake of her loved ones."
