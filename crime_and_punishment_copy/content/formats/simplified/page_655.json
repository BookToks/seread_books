  "text": "Svidrigaïlov was dressed nicely in light summer clothes and had a fancy ring with a valuable stone on it. \n\n“Do I have to worry about you now?” Raskolnikov said suddenly, feeling impatient. “Even if you might be the most dangerous person who could hurt me, I don’t want to stress myself out anymore. I’ll make it clear that I don’t value my life as much as you think I do. I’m here to tell you that if you keep trying to get close to my sister and think you can gain anything from what’s happened recently, I will kill you before you can get me arrested. You can count on that. You know I can follow through. \n\nAlso, if you have something to tell me—because I feel like you do—please hurry and say it, because time is important and it might be too late soon.”\n\n“Why are you in such a hurry?” Svidrigaïlov asked, looking at him with interest.\n\n“Everyone has their own plans,” Raskolnikov replied darkly and impatiently.\n\n“You just told me to be honest, yet now you won’t answer my first question,” Svidrigaïlov said with a smile. “You think I have my own goals and that’s why you’re suspicious of me. That makes sense given your situation. But even though I’d like us to be friends, I won’t try to convince you otherwise. It’s not worth the effort.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confronts Svidrigaïlov about his intentions towards his sister, threatening violence if necessary."
