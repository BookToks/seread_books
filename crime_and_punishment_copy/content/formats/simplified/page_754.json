  "text": "Raskolnikov was often gloomy and didn’t want to talk. He seemed uninterested in the news from their letters. Sometimes he asked about his mother, but when she finally told him she had died, she was surprised he didn’t seem very affected by it. \n\nShe explained that even though he seemed to keep to himself, he had a clear view of his new life. He understood his situation, had no false hopes, and wasn’t shocked by anything around him, which was very different from what he was used to. \n\nShe mentioned that his health was okay. He worked hard without trying to do more than he had to. He didn’t care much about food, but the meals were so bad that he eventually accepted some money from Sonia to buy his own tea every day. He asked her not to worry about anything else, saying that all the fuss annoyed him. \n\nSonia wrote that he shared a room with others, and although she hadn’t seen their barracks, she guessed they were crowded and unhealthy. He slept on a wooden bed with just a rug underneath and didn’t want to change that. He lived poorly not because he planned to, but because he didn’t pay attention to it. \n\nSonia also noted that at first, he didn’t care about her visits and seemed annoyed with her.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's indifference to his mother's death reflects his deep internal struggles and detachment from his surroundings."
