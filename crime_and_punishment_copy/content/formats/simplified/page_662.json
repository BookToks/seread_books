  "text": "Marfa Petrovna let me have some freedom with the maids, but only because she secretly allowed it. She really didn’t want me to fall in love with a woman like her. If I ever did fall in love seriously, I had to tell Marfa Petrovna. She felt safe about this because she thought I was too wild to really love anyone. \n\nBut being sensible and being jealous are very different, and that’s where the problems started. To judge people fairly, we need to let go of our usual opinions and views about them. I trust your judgment more than anyone else's. You might have heard some silly things about Marfa Petrovna. She had some funny habits, but I honestly feel sorry for all the problems I caused her. \n\nThat’s enough about my late wife, who was very kind. When we argued, I usually stayed quiet and didn’t upset her, and that often worked well. It made her happy and proud of me. But she couldn’t stand your sister. I don’t know why she decided to take such a lovely girl into her house as a governess. I think Marfa Petrovna was a passionate woman and just fell in love with your sister.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marfa Petrovna, despite her sensible nature, was deeply affected by jealousy and love, particularly towards Avdotya Romanovna, complicating her relationship with Svidrigaïlov."
