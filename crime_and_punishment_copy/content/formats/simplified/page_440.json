  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nThis uncle has a thousand roubles saved up. He lives on his pension and doesn't need that money. For the last two years, he has been asking me to borrow it from him and pay him six percent interest. I know he just wants to help me. Last year, I didn’t need it, but this year I decided to borrow it as soon as he arrives. Then you lend me another thousand from your three, and we will have enough to start our business together. What are we going to do?\n\nThen Razumihin started to explain his idea. He said that most publishers and booksellers don’t really know what they are selling, which makes them bad at their jobs. Good publications usually make money, sometimes a lot. Razumihin had been dreaming of starting his own publishing company. For the last two years, he worked in publishing offices and knows three European languages well, even though he told Raskolnikov six days ago that he was weak in German to convince him to share a translation and payment. Raskolnikov knew he was lying.\n\n“Why should we miss our chance when we have money of our own?” Razumihin said excitedly. “Of course, there will be a lot of work, but we will work together— you, Avdotya Romanovna, and I, Rodion. Some books can make a great profit these days! The best part is that we will know exactly what we are doing.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin proposes a publishing partnership, leveraging borrowed money to capitalize on the potential profitability of the book market."
