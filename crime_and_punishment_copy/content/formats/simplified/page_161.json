He needed to hurry.\n\nHe leaned down, grabbed a stone with both hands, and turned it over. Under the stone was a small hole in the ground, and he quickly dumped his pocket into it. The purse was on top, but the hole was still not full. Then he flipped the stone back into place, making sure it looked the same, even if it was a little higher. He pressed the dirt around it with his foot so no one would notice anything.\n\nAfter that, he went outside and walked into the square. For a moment, he felt a strong, almost overwhelming joy, just like he had felt at the police office. \"I have hidden my tracks! Who would think to look under that stone? It has probably been there since the house was built and will stay there for many more years. If someone finds it, who would think of me? It’s all over! No clues!\" He laughed quietly to himself as he crossed the square. \n\nBut when he reached the K— Boulevard, where he had seen that girl two days ago, his laughter suddenly stopped. New thoughts filled his mind. He felt sick at the idea of passing the spot where he had sat and thought after the girl left, and he also felt disgusted at the thought of running into her again.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist experiences a mix of intense joy and anxiety after burying evidence of his crime, believing he has successfully hidden his tracks."
