  "text": "Katerina Ivanovna thought that only Amalia Ivanovna could have set the table. She didn't like the new ribbons on Amalia's cap. She wondered if Amalia was acting superior just because she was in charge of the house and helped the poor lodgers. Katerina remembered that her father, who was a colonel and almost a governor, used to have big dinners for many people, and someone like Amalia wouldn't have been allowed in the kitchen.\n\nKaterina decided to hold back her feelings for now and treat Amalia coldly. She felt that she needed to put Amalia in her place because Amalia seemed to think too highly of herself. Katerina was also annoyed that very few lodgers came to the funeral, except for a Pole who happened to be at the cemetery. At the memorial dinner, only the poorest and least important lodgers showed up, many of them not sober. The more respectable lodgers, like Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, stayed away. Katerina had told everyone the night before that Luzhin was a generous and noble man with a lot of money and connections, and that he had promised to help her.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna feels disillusioned and irritated by the lack of respect shown by the lodgers and the behavior of Amalia Ivanovna during a memorial dinner."
