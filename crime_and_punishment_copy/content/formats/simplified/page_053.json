The letter was written so beautifully and with such feeling that I cried when I read it. Even now, I can't read it without tearing up. \n\nThe servants also helped clear Dounia’s name. They knew more than Mr. Svidrigaïlov thought they did, which is often true with servants. Marfa Petrovna was shocked and felt defeated, but she became fully convinced of Dounia’s innocence. \n\nThe next day, on Sunday, she went to the Cathedral, knelt down, and prayed with tears for strength to handle this new challenge and to do what was right. After that, she came to us, told us everything, cried hard, and sincerely asked Dounia to forgive her. \n\nThat same morning, she quickly went to every house in town. Everywhere she went, she cried and praised Dounia’s innocence and her kind heart. She showed everyone the letter Dounia wrote to Mr. Svidrigaïlov and even let them make copies, which I thought was a bit much. \n\nFor several days, she was busy going around the town because some people were upset about who got to hear the news first. So, she had to take turns visiting everyone.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marfa Petrovna's efforts to clear Dounia's name and restore her reputation lead to her public repentance and acknowledgment of Dounia's innocence."
