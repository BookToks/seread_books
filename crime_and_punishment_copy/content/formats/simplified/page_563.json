  "text": "I want everyone to listen to me. This man (he pointed to Luzhin) was going to marry my sister, Avdotya Romanovna Raskolnikov. But when he came to Petersburg, we had a fight the day before yesterday, and I kicked him out of my room. I have two witnesses to prove this. He is a very mean man.\n\nThe day before yesterday, I didn’t know he was staying here in your room. So, on the same day we fought, he saw me give Katerina Ivanovna some money for a funeral because I was a friend of the late Mr. Marmeladov. He then wrote a note to my mother, saying I had given all my money not to Katerina Ivanovna but to Sofya Semyonovna. He also made nasty comments about Sofya Semyonovna to make my mother and sister think I was wasting their money on someone unworthy.\n\nLast night, in front of my mother and sister and him, I said I had given the money to Katerina Ivanovna for the funeral, not to Sofya Semyonovna, and that I didn’t know Sofya Semyonovna at all. I also said that Luzhin, no matter how good he thinks he is, isn't worth even a tiny bit of Sofya Semyonovna, even though he talks badly about her.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov defends Sofya Semyonovna against Luzhin's malicious accusations, asserting his integrity and the truth about his financial dealings."
