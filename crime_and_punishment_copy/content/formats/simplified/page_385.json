  "text": "Raskolnikov finally calmed down and quietly left the room. His thoughts were all mixed up as he walked through the gateway. \n\n“Here he is!” shouted a loud voice. \n\nHe looked up. The porter was standing at his little room door, pointing him out to a short man who looked like a worker. The man wore a long coat and a waistcoat, and from a distance, he looked a bit like a woman. He hunched over, and his greasy cap hung low. He looked over fifty with a wrinkled face, and his small eyes were hidden in fat, looking grim and unhappy.\n\n“What is it?” Raskolnikov asked as he approached the porter. \n\nThe man glanced at him and studied him carefully, then slowly turned and walked out into the street without saying anything. \n\n“What is it?” Raskolnikov shouted again. \n\nThe porter replied, “He was asking if a student lived here, mentioned your name and who you stayed with. I saw you coming, pointed you out, and then he left. It’s strange.” \n\nThe porter seemed a bit confused but not too much. After thinking for a moment, he went back to his room. \n\nRaskolnikov chased after the stranger and soon saw him walking on the other side of the street, moving slowly with his eyes on the ground as if deep in thought. Raskolnikov caught up to him but walked behind him for a while.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov encounters a mysterious stranger who inquires about him, leaving him puzzled and anxious."
