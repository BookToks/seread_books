  "text": "Raskolnikov felt a strong impression from a man sitting a little way from him, who looked like a retired clerk. This impression stuck with him later, and he thought it might be a sign of something. The clerk kept staring at him, eager to start a conversation. \n\nThe clerk seemed used to the other people in the room, including the tavern-keeper, but he looked down on them, thinking they were beneath him. He was over fifty, bald, and stout. His face was puffy from drinking and had a yellowish-green color, with swollen eyelids and sharp reddish eyes that seemed to shine with a strange light. \n\nThere was something odd about him; his eyes showed strong feelings, maybe even intelligence, but also a hint of madness. He wore an old, ragged black coat with only one button, which he had fastened, holding on to this last bit of dignity. His shirt front was wrinkled and stained, sticking out from his worn waistcoat. He didn’t have a beard or mustache, but he hadn’t shaved in so long that his chin looked like a rough grey brush. Despite this, he had a respectable way of acting. However, he was restless and fidgety.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is struck by the peculiar presence of a retired clerk in a tavern, whose appearance and demeanor evoke a mix of contempt and intrigue."
