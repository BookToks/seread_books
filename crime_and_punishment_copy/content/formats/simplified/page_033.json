  "text": "My little darling had only helped with money for a little while. She said, “I can’t come to see you too often. Maybe after dark when no one can see.” \n\nDo you hear that? I laid down for a nap after dinner, and guess what? Even though Katerina Ivanovna had a big fight with our landlady Amalia Fyodorovna just a week ago, she couldn’t help but invite her in for coffee. They sat together for two hours, whispering. \n\n“Semyon Zaharovitch is back to work now and getting paid,” she said. “He even went to see his boss, and the boss came out to him, made everyone else wait, and took Semyon Zaharovitch into his office.” \n\nDo you hear that? The boss said, “Of course, Semyon Zaharovitch, remembering what you did before, and even though you have that silly weakness, I trust you now since you promise to behave. We’ve had a hard time without you.” \n\nAnd let me tell you, she made all that up herself. It’s not just for fun; she really believes it. She entertains herself with her own ideas, I swear she does! I don’t blame her for it. \n\nSix days ago, when I brought her my first earnings—twenty-three roubles and forty kopecks—she called me her poppet. “Poppet,” she said, “my little poppet.” And when we were alone, you know? You wouldn’t think I’m good-looking or a great husband, would you? But she pinched my cheek and called me “my little poppet.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marmeladov recounts his struggles and the delusions of his wife, Katerina Ivanovna, as he reflects on their life and his recent earnings."
