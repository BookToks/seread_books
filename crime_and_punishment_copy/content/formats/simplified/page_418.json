They’ll feel so embarrassed later! Forget them! We can deal with them later, but let’s have fun now!\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Raskolnikov replied. \"But what will you say tomorrow?\" he thought. It was strange that he hadn’t thought about what Razumihin would think when he found out. As he thought this, Raskolnikov looked at him. Razumihin’s story about his visit to Porfiry didn’t interest him much; so much had happened since then.\n\nIn the hallway, they saw Luzhin. He had arrived on time at eight and was looking for the right door, so all three went in together without saying hi or even looking at each other. The two young men went in first, while Pyotr Petrovitch waited a moment in the hallway to take off his coat. Pulcheria Alexandrovna quickly came to greet him at the door, while Dounia welcomed her brother. Pyotr Petrovitch entered and politely bowed to the ladies, but he looked a bit upset and still seemed to be getting himself together. Pulcheria Alexandrovna, who also seemed a bit awkward, hurried to make everyone sit at the round table where a samovar was boiling. Dounia and Luzhin sat across from each other at the table. Razumihin and Raskolnikov faced Pulcheria Alexandrovna, with Razumihin sitting next to him.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reflects on the absurdity of his situation and the reactions of those around him as they gather for a meeting."
