  "text": "Dostoevsky had epilepsy, which he dealt with for his whole life. He had seizures three or four times a year, especially during stressful times. In 1859, he was allowed to go back to Russia. He started a journal called ‘Vremya,’ but it was banned because of a misunderstanding. \n\nIn 1864, he lost his first wife and his brother Mihail. He was very poor, but he took on his brother’s debts. He then started another journal called ‘The Epoch,’ but it was also banned a few months later. He was overwhelmed by debt, his brother’s family relied on him, and he had to write very quickly, often without editing his work. His second wife brought him comfort in his later years.\n\nIn June 1880, he gave a famous speech at the unveiling of a monument to Pushkin in Moscow, where people showed him great love and respect. A few months later, Dostoevsky passed away. Many mourners attended his funeral, giving him a send-off fit for a king. He is still one of the most read writers in Russia.\n\nA Russian critic described Dostoevsky as someone very relatable, who suffered and understood life deeply. His insight is seen as wisdom that helps others learn how to live. While he had many natural talents, this wisdom was something he earned through his experiences.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dostoevsky faced immense personal and financial struggles throughout his life, yet he remained a deeply influential and beloved figure in Russian literature."
