Tell me,\" he said almost in a panic, \"how can this shame and lowliness exist in you along with other, holy feelings? It would be a thousand times better and smarter to jump into the water and end it all!\"\n\n\"But what would happen to them?\" Sonia asked weakly, looking at him with sad eyes, but she didn’t seem surprised by his idea.\n\nRaskolnikov looked at her in a strange way. He could see everything in her face; she must have thought about that before, maybe many times, and had seriously considered how to end it. She had thought about it so much that she barely reacted to his suggestion. She didn’t even notice how cruel his words were. He understood that she was deeply hurt by her shameful situation and had been for a long time. \n\n\"What could have stopped her from ending it?\" he wondered. Only then did he realize what those poor orphan children and the half-crazy Katerina Ivanovna, who was hitting her head against the wall, meant to Sonia.\n\nBut still, he understood that with her character and the education she had, she couldn’t stay like this forever. He was still puzzled about how she had managed to stay in that situation for so long without losing her mind, especially since she couldn’t bring herself to jump into the water.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov grapples with Sonia's enduring shame and despair, questioning how she can maintain her humanity amidst her degrading circumstances."
