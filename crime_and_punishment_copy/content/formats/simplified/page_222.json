  "text": "I saw that you were upset with me, but I stayed here to learn more. I can forgive a lot in a sick person and a friend, but you... never again after this.\n\n\"I'm not sick,\" Raskolnikov shouted.\n\n\"That's even worse...\"\n\n\"Go to hell!\"\n\nBut Luzhin was already leaving without finishing what he wanted to say. He squeezed between the table and the chair, and Razumihin stood up to let him pass. He didn't look at anyone, not even Zossimov, who had been trying to signal him to leave the sick man alone. Luzhin left, lifting his hat to avoid crushing it as he bent to go through the door. Even the way he walked showed how insulted he felt.\n\n\"How could you—how could you!\" Razumihin said, shaking his head in confusion.\n\n\"Leave me alone—leave me alone, all of you!\" Raskolnikov yelled in a rage. \"Will you ever stop bothering me? I'm not scared of you! I'm not scared of anyone anymore! Get away from me! I want to be alone, alone, alone!\"\n\n\"Come on,\" Zossimov said, nodding to Razumihin.\n\n\"But we can't leave him like this!\"\n\n\"Come on,\" Zossimov insisted, and he went out. Razumihin thought for a moment and then ran to catch up with him.\n\n\"It might be worse not to listen to him,\" Zossimov said on the stairs. \"We shouldn't make him angry.\"\n\n\"What's wrong with him?\"\n\n\"If only he could get some kind of shock that would help him, that's what we need.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses his intense frustration and desire for solitude amidst the tension with Luzhin and concern from his friends."
