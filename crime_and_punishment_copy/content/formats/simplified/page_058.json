  "text": "Dounia talked to Pyotr Petrovitch about hiring you as his secretary. He thinks it's better to pay a family member than a stranger, as long as you're suitable for the job. However, he wondered if your university studies would leave you enough time to work for him. \n\nDounia is very focused on this idea right now. She has been excited and has made a plan for you to eventually become an associate and even a partner in Pyotr Petrovitchâ€™s business, since you are studying law. I completely agree with her and believe we can make this happen. \n\nEven though Pyotr Petrovitch is a bit unsure right now because he doesn't know you yet, Dounia believes her positive influence will help her gain everything she wants from him. We are careful not to mention our bigger plans to him, especially about you becoming his partner, since he might think it's unrealistic. \n\nNeither Dounia nor I have told him about our hopes for him to help pay for your university studies. We think he will offer to help on his own later, especially since you could become very helpful to him in the office.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia is fervently planning for Rodya to work with Pyotr Petrovitch, believing it could lead to a partnership and financial support for his university studies."
