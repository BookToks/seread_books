We all act a bit crazy sometimes, but crazy people are usually worse. There are hardly any normal people around.” \n\nWhen Zossimov mentioned “madman,” everyone frowned. Raskolnikov seemed lost in thought, smiling strangely. \n\nRazumihin interrupted, asking about the man who got run over. Raskolnikov came back to reality and said, “Oh, I got blood on me when I helped carry him. By the way, Mom, I did something really wrong yesterday. I wasn’t thinking straight. I gave away all the money you sent me for his wife’s funeral. She’s now a widow, sick, and has three hungry kids. I know you needed the money too. I shouldn’t have done it without being sure I could. To help others, you need to be able to.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reflects on his actions and the nature of madness while grappling with guilt over giving away money meant for his family to help a widow."
