This is to distract the person they are questioning, to lower their guard, and then hit them with a surprising question. Isn’t that right? It’s a tradition mentioned in all the guides about this.”\n\n“Yes, yes... Do you think that’s why I talked about government buildings… huh?”\n\nAs he said this, Porfiry Petrovitch squinted and winked; a playful, clever look crossed his face. His forehead smoothed out, his eyes narrowed, and he suddenly burst into a long, nervous laugh, shaking all over and looking straight at Raskolnikov. Raskolnikov forced himself to laugh too, but when Porfiry saw him laughing, he laughed so hard that he turned almost red. Raskolnikov’s dislike took over his caution; he stopped laughing, frowned, and stared at Porfiry with anger while Porfiry continued to laugh loudly. Both of them were careless, as Porfiry seemed to be laughing right in Raskolnikov’s face and didn’t seem bothered by Raskolnikov’s irritation.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov and Porfiry Petrovitch engage in a tense exchange, highlighting the psychological tactics used in legal interrogations."
