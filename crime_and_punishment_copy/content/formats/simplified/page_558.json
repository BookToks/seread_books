Lebeziatnikov walked into the room.\n\n“And you dared to call me as a witness?” he said, approaching Pyotr Petrovitch.\n\n“What do you mean? What are you talking about?” Luzhin mumbled.\n\n“I mean that you are a liar, that’s what I mean!” Lebeziatnikov said angrily, looking at him with his short-sighted eyes.\n\nHe was very mad. Raskolnikov watched him closely, paying attention to every word. There was silence again. Pyotr Petrovitch looked stunned for a moment.\n\n“If you’re talking about me…” he started, stammering. “But what’s wrong with you? Are you crazy?”\n\n“I’m not crazy, but you are a scoundrel! How awful! I heard everything. I was waiting to understand it, but honestly, it still doesn’t make sense… I can’t figure out why you did all this.”\n\n“Why, what did I do? Stop talking in your confusing riddles! Or maybe you’re drunk!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Lebeziatnikov confronts Pyotr Petrovitch, accusing him of slander and expressing his outrage over his actions."
