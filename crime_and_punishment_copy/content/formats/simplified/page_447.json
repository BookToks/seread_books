  "text": "Raskolnikov quickly turned away and sat on a chair by the table. He looked around the room with a quick glance.\n\nThe room was large but had a very low ceiling. It was the only room rented by the Kapernaumovs, and there was a closed door on the left wall that led to their rooms. On the right wall, there was another door that was always locked, leading to a separate flat. Soniaâ€™s room looked like a barn; its odd shape made it look strange. One wall had three windows facing the canal, but they were at an angle, making it hard to see without bright light. The opposite corner was oddly shaped and wide. \n\nThere was almost no furniture in the big room. In the right corner was a bed, and next to it, near the door, was a chair. A simple table covered with a blue cloth was against the wall close to the locked door. There were two plain chairs by the table. On the opposite wall near the sharp corner was a small wooden chest of drawers that looked out of place. That was all that was in the room. The yellow wallpaper was old and scratched, and the corners were dark. It seemed damp and musty in the winter. The room showed signs of poverty; even the bed had no curtain.\n\nSonia silently watched Raskolnikov as he carefully looked around her room. She started to shake with fear, as if she was worried about what he thought.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov visits Sonia's impoverished and dismal room, reflecting the starkness of her living conditions."
