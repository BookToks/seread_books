  "text": "**Crime and Punishment**  \n**Chapter V**  \n\nThe next morning at eleven o'clock, Raskolnikov went to the criminal investigation office and sent his name to Porfiry Petrovitch. He was surprised to wait so long; it was at least ten minutes before he was called in. He thought they would rush to see him. Instead, he stood in the waiting room while people who seemed unrelated to him walked back and forth.  \n\nIn the next room, which looked like an office, several clerks were writing and clearly had no idea who Raskolnikov was. He looked around nervously, wondering if someone was watching him to stop him from escaping. But there was nothing like that. He only saw clerks focused on their work and other people who didn’t seem to care about him at all. He could have left if he wanted to.  \n\nHe started to think that if that strange man from yesterday, who felt like a ghost, had seen everything, they wouldn’t have made him wait like this. And would they have let him choose to come at eleven? Either the man hadn’t reported anything, or he simply didn’t know anything and couldn’t have seen anything.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov anxiously waits at the investigation department, feeling paranoid about being observed while questioning whether anyone knows of his involvement in a crime."
