Raskolnikov went back inside.\n\n\"I want to rent a flat,\" he said. \"I'm just looking around.\"\n\n\"It's not the right time to look at places at night! You should come with the porter.\"\n\n\"The floors have been washed; will they be painted?\" Raskolnikov asked. \"Is there no blood?\"\n\n\"What blood?\" \n\n\"The old woman and her sister were murdered here. There was a big pool of blood.\"\n\n\"But who are you?\" the workman asked, feeling uneasy.\n\n\"Who am I?\" \n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You want to know? Go to the police station, and I'll tell you.\"\n\nThe workmen looked at him in shock.\n\n\"It's time for us to go; we are late. Come on, Alyoshka. We need to lock up,\" said the older workman.\n\n\"Okay, let's go,\" Raskolnikov said casually. He went outside first and walked slowly down the stairs. \"Hey, porter,\" he called out at the entrance.\n\nSeveral people were standing there, watching those who passed by; two porters, a peasant woman, a man in a long coat, and a few others. Raskolnikov walked right up to them.\n\n\"What do you want?\" one of the porters asked.\n\n\"Have you been to the police office?\"\n\n\"I just came from there. What do you want?\"\n\n\"Is it open?\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, seeking a flat, engages in a tense conversation about a recent murder at the location."
