It’s only signed with an initial.”\n\n“I learned it by chance the other day, through the editor; I know him… I was very interested.”\n\n“I analyzed, if I remember, the psychology of a criminal before and after the crime.”\n\n“Yes, and you said that committing a crime always comes with illness. Very original, but… it wasn’t that part that interested me so much. It was an idea at the end of your article that I wish you had explained better. You suggested that some people can, not exactly that they are able to, but that they have the right to break moral rules and laws, and that the law doesn’t apply to them.”\n\nRaskolnikov smiled at how exaggerated and twisted his idea was.\n\n“What? A right to crime? But not because of the influence of the environment?” Razumihin asked, sounding worried.\n\n“No, not exactly because of that,” Porfiry replied. “In your article, you divided people into ‘ordinary’ and ‘extraordinary.’ Ordinary people have to follow the rules and can’t break the law because they are ordinary. But extraordinary people have the right to commit any crime and break the law just because they are extraordinary. That was your idea, right?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The conversation revolves around the distinction between \"ordinary\" and \"extraordinary\" individuals regarding their moral and legal rights to commit crimes."
