  "text": "For the one she loves, for the one she adores, she will give up everything! That's what it comes down to; for her brother and her mother, she will sell herself! She will give up everything! In these situations, we ignore our morals if we need to. We put our freedom, peace, and conscience on the line. Let my life go, as long as my loved ones are happy! We even convince ourselves that it is our duty for a good reason. This is just how we are, it’s very clear.\n\nRodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov is the main person in this situation, and no one else. Yes, she can make him happy, keep him in school, help him become a partner at work, and secure his future. He might even become rich, respected, and famous one day! But what about my mother? It's all about Rodya, her firstborn! For such a son, who wouldn’t sacrifice a daughter? Oh, loving and overly caring hearts! For his sake, we wouldn’t even hesitate to face Sonia’s fate. Sonia, Sonia Marmeladov, the eternal victim as long as the world exists.\n\nHave you thought about your sacrifice, both of you? Is it right? Can you handle it? Is it worth it? And let me tell you, Dounia, Sonia’s life is no worse than life with Mr. Luzhin. “There can be no question of love,” mother writes. But what if there’s no respect either? What if there’s dislike, disgust, or even hatred? Then you will have to keep up appearances too, right? Do you understand what that smartness means? Do you see that the Luzhin smartness is just the same?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia is willing to sacrifice herself for her family's happiness, questioning the morality and consequences of such sacrifices."
