  "text": "A man wearing a worn coat and a not-so-clean shirt was in a good mood. He was smiling a lot, and his face was a bit red from the champagne he had drunk.\n\n\"Hey, you’re here?\" he said, surprised, as if he had known Raskolnikov forever. \"Razumihin told me just yesterday that you were unconscious. How strange! Did you know I came to see you?\"\n\nRaskolnikov expected him to come over. He put down the papers and looked at Zametov. He smiled, but there was a hint of annoyance in that smile.\n\n\"I know you did,\" Raskolnikov replied. \"I heard about it. You were looking for my sock. And Razumihin has a crush on you. He says you went with him to Luise Ivanovna’s place—you know, the woman you tried to help, and you winked at the Explosive Lieutenant, but he didn’t get it. Do you remember? It was pretty obvious, right?\"\n\n\"He's such a hothead!\" Zametov said.\n\n\"Are you talking about him or the Explosive one?\" Raskolnikov asked.\n\n\"No, your friend Razumihin.\"\n\n\"You must have a fun life, Mr. Zametov; you get to go to all the best places for free. Who just poured champagne for you?\"\n\n\"We were just having a drink together. You think someone poured it into me?\" \n\n\"Like a tip! You take advantage of everything!\" Raskolnikov laughed and playfully hit Zametov on the back.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov encounters Zametov in a restaurant, revealing a mix of humor and irritation in their conversation."
