Goodbye.” \n\nWithout shaking hands, he walked away. \n\n“But where are you going? What are you doing? What’s wrong with you? How can you keep going like this?” Razumihin said, feeling confused. \n\nRaskolnikov stopped again. \n\n“Listen, don’t ask me about anything. I have nothing to tell you. Don’t visit me. Maybe I’ll come here. Leave me alone, but don’t leave them. Do you understand?” \n\nIt was dark in the hallway, and they stood by the lamp. They looked at each other in silence for a moment. Razumihin remembered that moment for the rest of his life. Raskolnikov’s intense eyes seemed to look deeper into him, into his mind. Suddenly, Razumihin felt a chill. Something strange passed between them—an idea, a hint, something terrible that they both understood. Razumihin turned pale. \n\n“Do you understand now?” Raskolnikov said, his face twitching. “Go back, go to them,” he said quickly, and then he left the house. \n\nI won’t try to explain how Razumihin returned to the women, how he comforted them, how he insisted that Rodya needed rest because he was sick, that Rodya would come back, that he would visit every day, that he was very upset and shouldn’t be bothered.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov insists that Razumihin should leave him alone and return to the others, hinting at a deeper, troubling understanding between them."
