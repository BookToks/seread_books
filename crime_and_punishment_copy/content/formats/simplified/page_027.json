  "text": "She paid him back, and I have proof of that, but she still talks about him with tears. She remembers feeling happy once, and I’m glad she thinks that way, even if it’s just in her mind. After he died, she was left alone with three kids in a faraway place where I happened to be. She was very poor, and even though I’ve been through many tough times, I can’t describe how bad it was for her. Her family had abandoned her. She was also very proud.\n\nThen, I, a widower with a 14-year-old daughter from my first wife, offered to marry her because I couldn’t stand to see her suffering. You can imagine how desperate her situation was that she, a well-educated woman from a good family, agreed to be my wife. She married me while crying and in despair because she had nowhere else to go. Do you understand what it means to have no options? No, I guess you don’t yet.\n\nFor a whole year, I did my best to take care of her and didn’t drink (he pointed to the jug). I have feelings, after all. But even then, I couldn’t make her happy. Then I lost my job, not because of anything I did but because of changes at work, and that’s when I started drinking. Soon, it will be a year and a half since we finally arrived in this great city filled with many monuments after a lot of struggles and hardships.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The speaker recounts the hardships and sacrifices of his wife, who married him out of desperation despite her proud background and education."
