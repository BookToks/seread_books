  "text": "“Let me go!” Raskolnikov said as he tried to get past him. This was too much for Razumihin; he grabbed Raskolnikov firmly by the shoulder.\n\n“Let you go? You think you can just tell me that? Do you know what I’ll do? I’ll pick you up, wrap you up, carry you home, and lock you in!” \n\n“Listen, Razumihin,” Raskolnikov said quietly, trying to stay calm. “Can’t you see that I don’t want your help? It’s strange that you want to do nice things for someone who hates them and feels like they’re a burden! Why did you come to me when I got sick? Maybe I wanted to die. Didn’t I tell you today that you were bothering me, that I was sick of you? You seem to enjoy making people suffer! I promise you that this is really stopping me from getting better because it keeps annoying me. You saw Zossimov leave just now to avoid bothering me. Please leave me alone! What right do you have to keep me here against my will? Can’t you see that I’m okay now? How can I convince you to stop bothering me with your kindness? I might seem ungrateful or mean, but just let me be! Please, let me be!”\n\nHe started calmly, thinking about the harsh words he wanted to say, but ended up breathless and frantic, just like he had been with Luzhin.\n\nRazumihin paused for a moment, thought, and then let go of him. “Well, go to hell then,” he said gently and thoughtfully.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses his frustration with Razumihin's attempts to help him, insisting that he prefers solitude over unwanted kindness."
