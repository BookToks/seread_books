  "text": "A nice, fancy country house in the English style was full of sweet-smelling flowers, with flower beds all around it. The porch was covered in climbing plants and surrounded by rose bushes. A light staircase, covered with rich rugs, had beautiful plants in china pots. He especially noticed the windows with bunches of soft, white, fragrant narcissus flowers leaning over their tall, green stems. He didn’t want to leave them, but he went up the stairs into a big, high drawing room, which also had flowers everywhere—at the windows, the doors leading to the balcony, and on the balcony itself. \n\nThe floors were covered with fresh-smelling hay, and the windows were open, letting in cool, fresh air. Birds were chirping outside, and in the middle of the room was a table covered with a white satin cloth, holding a coffin. The coffin was covered in white silk and had a thick white trim; it was surrounded by flower wreaths. Inside the coffin lay a girl in a white dress, with her arms crossed over her chest, looking like she was made of marble. Her long, light hair was wet, and she wore a wreath of roses on her head. The serious and stiff look on her face seemed like it was carved from marble too, and the smile on her pale lips showed great sadness and pain. \n\nSvidrigaïlov recognized the girl; there were no religious images, no burning candles near the coffin, and no prayers being said: she had drowned herself. She was only fourteen, but her heart was broken. She had taken her own life because she was hurt by something terrible that had shocked everyone.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov discovers a coffin in a beautifully adorned room, revealing the tragic fate of a young girl who drowned herself in despair."
