Is it possible it really will happen?” \n\nHe left the seat and almost ran away. He meant to go home, but the thought of going home made him feel sick. In that small, awful place he lived, everything had been building up in him for a month. So, he just walked on without a clear direction.\n\nHis nervous shaking turned into a fever that made him feel cold, even though it was hot outside. He tried to look at everything around him, almost without thinking, as if he was looking for something to take his mind off things. But he couldn’t focus and kept getting lost in his thoughts. When he finally looked up again, he forgot what he had been thinking about and where he was going.\n\nHe walked all the way across Vassilyevsky Ostrov, came out by the Lesser Neva, crossed the bridge, and headed toward the islands. The green trees and fresh air were nice for his tired eyes after the dusty town and the big buildings that felt heavy on him. There were no bars, no stuffy air, and no bad smells here. \n\nBut soon, these nice feelings turned into irritation. Sometimes he stopped in front of a colorful summer house surrounded by green trees. He looked through the fence and saw well-dressed women on the porches and kids playing in the gardens. He especially noticed the flowers; he stared at them.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences intense inner turmoil and loathing as he wanders through the city, seeking distraction from his troubling thoughts."
