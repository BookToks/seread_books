  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nHe remembered the wise old man and the Bible came to mind again. Do you know, Rodion Romanovitch, how much the word \"suffering\" means to some of these people? It’s not about suffering for someone else; it’s just that \"one must suffer.\" If they suffer because of the authorities, that’s even better for them. \n\nIn my time, there was a very gentle prisoner who spent a whole year in jail, always reading his Bible at night. He read so much that he went a little crazy. One day, for no reason, he picked up a brick and threw it at the governor, even though the governor hadn’t harmed him. He aimed to miss on purpose, so he wouldn’t hurt him. We all know what happens to a prisoner who attacks an officer. So, he accepted his suffering.\n\nI think now that Nikolay wants to accept his own suffering or something similar. I know this for sure from what I’ve seen, even though he doesn’t know that I know. You don’t believe there are such strange people among the peasants? There are many. The elder has started to influence him, especially since he tried to hang himself. But he will come and tell me everything himself. Do you think he will stick to what he said? Just wait a bit; he will change his mind. \n\nI am waiting for him to come back and take back his words. I have started to like Nikolay and I’m studying him closely. And guess what? He answered me well on some points, showing he had gathered some facts and prepared himself smartly. But on other points, he is completely lost, knows nothing, and doesn’t even realize it.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The discussion revolves around the concept of suffering among individuals, particularly in the context of a prisoner influenced by religious beliefs and the expectations of enduring hardship."
