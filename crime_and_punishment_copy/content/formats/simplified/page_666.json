  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nYou wouldn’t believe how far some girls will go for attention—using pleas, begging, even tears. It’s amazing! I, on the other hand, blamed it all on fate, pretending to be desperate for understanding. Finally, I used the most effective way to win a girl’s heart: flattery. \n\nTelling the truth is hard, but flattering someone is easy. If there’s even a tiny lie in the truth, it causes problems. But if flattery is completely false, it sounds nice and is still enjoyed. Even if the flattery is obvious, at least some of it will feel true. This works for everyone, no matter their background. Even a devoted woman can be won over with flattery.\n\nI remember once how I easily won over a woman who was loyal to her husband and family. It was so much fun and required little effort! She had her own strong beliefs. My strategy was to act completely humble and admire her goodness. I flattered her without shame, and as soon as I got a hand squeeze or a look from her, I would feel guilty for taking it. I would tell myself that she must have resisted me and that she was so innocent she couldn’t see my trickery. In the end, I succeeded while she stayed unaware.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The narrator reflects on the effectiveness of flattery as a means to manipulate and seduce women, contrasting it with the difficulty of speaking the truth."
