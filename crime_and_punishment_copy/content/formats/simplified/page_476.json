  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\n\"Hurry, it’s all nonsense. Oh, no, I’m very glad you’ve come to see me at last. I see you just as a visitor. And about my annoying laughter, please excuse it, Rodion Romanovitch. Rodion Romanovitch? That’s your name? It’s my nerves; you made me laugh so much with your funny comment. Sometimes I laugh like a rubber ball for half an hour. I often worry I might have a nervous breakdown. Please sit down, or I’ll think you’re angry.\"\n\nRaskolnikov didn’t say anything; he watched him with an angry frown. He sat down but still held his cap.\n\n\"I need to tell you something about myself, my dear Rodion Romanovitch,\" Porfiry Petrovitch said, moving around the room and avoiding Raskolnikov’s eyes. \"I’m a bachelor, not important, and not used to being social. I have nothing going on in my life; I’m just fading away. Have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that in our Petersburg circles, when two smart men meet who aren’t close friends but respect each other, it takes them half an hour to find something to talk about? They sit there awkwardly. Everyone has topics to discuss, like ladies do… people in high society always have things to talk about, it’s expected. But people like us, who think a lot, often struggle to find words and feel awkward. I don’t know if it’s because there’s a lack of common interests or if we’re too honest to pretend.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry Petrovitch expresses his awkwardness in social interactions, highlighting the difficulty of conversation between intelligent but unfamiliar individuals."
