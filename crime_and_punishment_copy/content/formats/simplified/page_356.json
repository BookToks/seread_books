  "text": "Raskolnikov sat down on the sofa, and Porfiry sat on the other end. He waited for Raskolnikov to explain why he was there. The serious way Porfiry was acting felt heavy and awkward, especially since Raskolnikov thought the topic was not that important. \n\nRaskolnikov managed to explain his business clearly and felt proud of himself. He even looked at Porfiry properly. Porfiry kept his eyes on him the whole time. Razumihin, sitting across from them, listened closely, looking back and forth between them with too much interest.\n\n“Fool,” Raskolnikov thought to himself.\n\n“You need to tell the police,” Porfiry said in a very serious tone, “that you heard about the murder and that you want to inform the lawyer that some things belong to you and that you want to get them back… or… they will write to you.”\n\n“That’s the problem,” Raskolnikov said, trying hard to act embarrassed. “Right now, I don’t have any money… even this small amount is too much for me… I just wanted to say that the things are mine, and when I have money…”\n\n“That’s not a problem,” Porfiry replied coldly to Raskolnikov's money situation. “You can write directly to me, saying that you know about this and claiming those things.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov discusses a matter of business with Porfiry Petrovitch, revealing his financial struggles while trying to claim ownership of certain items related to a murder."
