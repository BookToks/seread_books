  "text": "Raskolnikov noticed that a former officer and two students looked down on him. He felt that everyone disliked him and even started to hate him, but he didn’t understand why. Even men who had done worse things mocked his crime. They would say things like, “You’re a gentleman; you shouldn’t use an axe. That’s not what gentlemen do.”\n\nDuring the second week of Lent, he had to take the sacrament with the other prisoners. He went to church and prayed with them. One day, a fight broke out, and he didn’t know why. Suddenly, everyone turned on him in anger. They shouted, “You’re an infidel! You don’t believe in God; you should be killed.” \n\nRaskolnikov had never talked to them about God or his beliefs, but they wanted to harm him anyway. He stayed quiet. One prisoner charged at him in a rage, but Raskolnikov remained calm. He didn’t show any fear. The guard stepped in just in time to stop the fight.\n\nAnother thing he wondered about was why everyone liked Sonia so much. She didn’t try to win their favor and only visited him briefly at work. Still, everyone knew her and that she had come to follow him. They knew how she lived, but she never gave them money or did anything special for them. The only time she sent them anything was at Christmas when she gave them pies and rolls. Over time, they became closer to Sonia.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels isolated and despised by fellow prisoners, contrasting their love for life with his own turmoil, while Sonia earns their affection despite her minimal interactions."
