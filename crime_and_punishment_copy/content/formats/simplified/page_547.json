  "text": "On the day when her dead husband was on the table, Katerina Ivanovna worried about the place where they lived. Amalia Ivanovna said she had invited some ladies, but they didn't come because they wouldn't visit someone who isn't a real lady. Katerina Ivanovna quickly told her that since she was acting like a bad person, she couldn't judge what makes someone a real lady.\n\nAmalia Ivanovna then claimed that her father from Berlin was very important. She stood up from the table, put her hands in her pockets, puffed her cheeks, and made silly sounds like \"poof! poof!\" while everyone laughed, hoping to see a fight. \n\nThis made Katerina Ivanovna very angry. She loudly said that Amalia Ivanovna probably never had a father and was just a drunk person from Petersburg, and maybe she used to be a cook or something even worse. Amalia Ivanovna turned bright red and shouted back that maybe Katerina Ivanovna never had a father either, but she had a father from Berlin who wore a long coat and always said \"poof-poof-poof!\"\n\nKaterina Ivanovna looked down on her and said everyone knew about her family. She pointed out that a certificate said her father was a colonel, while Amalia Ivanovna's father—if she really had one—was probably just a Finnish milkman, and maybe she never had a father at all.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna and Amalia Ivanovna engage in a heated argument about their social status and family backgrounds, revealing deep-seated animosities."
