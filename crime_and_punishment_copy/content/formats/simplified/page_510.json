  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nPyotr Petrovitch thought, “They shouldn’t have refused me so easily! They are the kind of people who would feel bad about returning money and gifts if they ended things. It would be hard for them to do it! Their conscience would bother them: how can we get rid of someone who has been so generous and kind? I made a mistake.”\n\nHe called himself a fool, but not out loud.\n\nWhen he got home, he was even more irritated and angry. As he passed by Katerina Ivanovna’s place, he got curious about the funeral dinner she was preparing. He had heard about it the day before and thought he was invited, but he had been too caught up in his own problems to pay attention. \n\nHe asked Madame Lippevechsel, who was busy setting the table while Katerina was at the cemetery. She told him the dinner would be a big event, with all the lodgers invited, even those who didn’t know the dead man. Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov was invited too, even after their fight. Pyotr Petrovitch learned that not only was he invited, but everyone was looking forward to his arrival since he was the most important lodger. \n\nAmalia Ivanovna was also invited with great formality, despite some recent issues, and she was very busy preparing. She was dressed in new black silk and was proud of how she looked. This gave Pyotr Petrovitch an idea, and he went into his room, or rather Lebeziatnikov’s room, feeling thoughtful. He found out that Raskolnikov was going to be there too.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pyotr Petrovitch feels frustrated and irritated by various personal and social obligations, particularly regarding a funeral dinner he is expected to attend."
