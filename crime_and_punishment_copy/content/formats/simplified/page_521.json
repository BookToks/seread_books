  "text": "We talked about whether it’s an insult for a man to kiss a woman’s hand because it shows that he thinks he is better than her. I explained this to her, and she listened carefully to what I said about workers’ groups in France. Now I’m explaining how people will enter each other’s rooms in the future society.\n\n“What do you mean by that?” \n\nWe recently discussed if a person can enter another person’s room, whether it’s a man or a woman, at any time. We decided that they can!\n\n“It might happen at a bad time!” \n\nLebeziatnikov got really angry. \n\n“You always think of the worst things,” he said, upset. “I’m so annoyed that when I was explaining our ideas, I mentioned personal space too soon! People like you make fun of it before they really get it. And you’re so proud of that! I think this topic should only be talked about once someone truly believes in the system. \n\nAnd tell me, what’s so shameful about cleaning out dirty places? I would gladly do it. It’s not about being a hero; it’s just work, good, useful work that is as important as any other job, and even better than the work of famous artists like Raphael and Pushkin because it helps people more.” \n\n“And more honorable, more honorable, he-he-he!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The discussion revolves around the concepts of personal privacy, equality, and the value of work in a future society."
