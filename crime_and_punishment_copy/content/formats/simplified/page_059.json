  "text": "Dounia wants to set things up so that she gets paid for her work, not as a charity. I agree with her. We haven't talked about our plans because I wanted you to feel equal when you first meet him. When Dounia told him how great you are, he said you can't really know a person until you see them in person. He’s looking forward to meeting you and forming his own opinion.\n\nYou know, my dear Rodya, I think it might be better for me to live alone after the wedding. I believe he will be kind enough to invite me to stay with them, but I will say no. I've seen that husbands and their mothers-in-law often don’t get along, and I don’t want to cause any trouble. I’d rather be independent, as long as I have a little food and my children, you and Dounia. If I can, I would like to live close to you.\n\nNow, here’s the best news, dear Rodya: Dounia and I might be together very soon, and we can hug each other again after being apart for almost three years! It's certain that Dounia and I are going to Petersburg, and we’ll let you know exactly when.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia plans to work for a salary rather than as a charity, and expresses a desire for independence after her wedding."
