  "text": "\"It's all lies and nonsense!\" shouted Lebeziatnikov, who was always scared of talking about it. \"It wasn't like that at all; it was very different. You heard it wrong; it's a false accusation. I was just defending myself. She came at me first with her nails and pulled out all my whiskers. I hope anyone can defend themselves, and I never let anyone use violence against me because it's wrong. What was I supposed to do? I just pushed her back.\"\n\n\"He-he-he!\" Luzhin kept laughing meanly. \"You say that because you're in a bad mood. But that's nonsense and has nothing to do with women's rights! You don't get it; I used to think that if women are equal to men in everything, even strength, then there should be equality in that too. But I thought about it later and realized that fighting shouldn't happen at all, and in the future, it won't. It would be strange to want equality in fighting. I'm not that stupid... but there is fighting now. It won't be in the future, but right now it exists. It's confusing talking to you! That's not why I'm not going. I'm not going because I don't want to be part of the disgusting tradition of memorial dinners. Though I could go just to laugh at it... I'm disappointed there won't be any priests there. I would definitely go if there were.\" \n\n\"Then you would sit at someone else's table and insult it and the people who invited you. Right?\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Lebeziatnikov defends his actions against a woman while discussing the complexities of gender equality and societal conventions."
