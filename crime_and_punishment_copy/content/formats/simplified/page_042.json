Inside, you could see people in open dressing gowns and revealing outfits, some holding cards. They found it funny when Marmeladov, being pulled by his hair, yelled that it was a comfort to him. They started to come into the room, and then a loud shout was heard. It was Amalia Lippevechsel, trying to push through the crowd and restore order. She was once again trying to scare the poor woman by telling her to leave the room the next day.\n\nAs Raskolnikov left, he quickly reached into his pocket, took out the coins he had gotten for his rouble at the tavern, and placed them on the window without anyone noticing. Later, on the stairs, he changed his mind and thought about going back. \n\n\"What a dumb thing I've done,\" he thought. \"They have Sonia, and I want it too.\" But he realized he couldn't take it back now, and he wouldn't have taken it anyway, so he waved it off and went back to his place. \n\n\"Sonia wants pomatum too,\" he said as he walked down the street, laughing meanly. \"Such fancy stuff costs money... Hmm! Maybe Sonia will be broke today, because there's always a risk in chasing big dreams... digging for gold... then they would all be without food tomorrow except for my money. Cheers for Sonia! What a treasure theyâ€™ve found.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reflects on his actions and the financial struggles of Sonia and others, revealing his conflicted feelings about money and morality."
