She wanted me to thank you for helping us yesterday. Without you, we would have had nothing for the funeral.” \n\nSuddenly, her lips and chin started to tremble, but she managed to control herself and looked down again. \n\nDuring the talk, Raskolnikov watched her closely. She had a very thin, pale face with a sharp nose and chin. She wasn't pretty, but her blue eyes were clear, and when they sparkled, she looked kind and simple, which made people want to be around her. Even though she was eighteen, she looked almost like a little girl, and sometimes her childlike actions seemed silly. \n\n“But can Katerina Ivanovna really manage with so little? Is she really going to have a funeral lunch?” Raskolnikov asked, keeping the conversation going. \n\n“The coffin will be simple, and everything will be basic, so it won’t cost much. Katerina Ivanovna and I have figured it all out, so there will be enough left.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia informs Raskolnikov about the funeral arrangements and expresses gratitude for his previous help, revealing her emotional struggle."
