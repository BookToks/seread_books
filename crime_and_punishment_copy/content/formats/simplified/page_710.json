  "text": "that innocent person had been unfairly hurt and had cried out in despair on a dark, cold night while the wind howled.\n\nSvidrigaïlov got up from the bed and went to the window. He found the latch and opened it. The wind rushed into the small room and hit his bare skin like frost. Below the window, there seemed to be a garden, maybe a nice one with tea tables where people sang during the day. Now, rain was coming in through the window from the trees and bushes. It was so dark that he could barely see anything. \n\nSvidrigaïlov leaned on the window sill and stared into the darkness for five minutes. Suddenly, he heard the sound of a cannon, followed by another one. \"Ah, the signal! The river is flooding,\" he thought. \"By morning, it will be rushing down the streets, flooding the basements. The rats will swim out, and people will curse in the rain and wind as they carry their things to higher ground. What time is it?\" Just then, a clock nearby ticked quickly and struck three.\n\n\"Great! It will be light in an hour! Why wait? I’ll go out to the park now. I’ll find a big bush soaked with rain, so when someone brushes against it, drops of water will fall on their head.\" \n\nHe stepped back from the window, closed it, and lit the candle.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov contemplates the darkness and impending flood outside his window, deciding to go out into the rain."
