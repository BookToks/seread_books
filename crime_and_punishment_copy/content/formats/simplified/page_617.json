  "text": "Raskolnikov suddenly felt uneasy again, like his conscience was bothering him. He thought, \"Should I really be sitting here listening to singing?\" But he also felt there was something else making him uneasy. It was something he couldn't understand or explain. It felt confusing. \"No, I’d rather face the struggle again! Better to deal with Porfiry or Svidrigaïlov. I want a challenge, something to fight against. Yes!\" he thought. He left the tavern and almost ran away. The thought of Dounia and his mother made him feel panicky.\n\nThat night, he woke up before dawn in some bushes on Krestovsky Island, shaking with fever. He walked home and arrived early in the morning. After sleeping for a few hours, the fever went away, but he woke up late, around two in the afternoon. He remembered that Katerina Ivanovna’s funeral was that day and felt relieved he wasn't there.\n\nNastasya brought him food, and he ate it eagerly. He felt more refreshed and calmer than he had in the last few days. He even wondered why he had felt so panicked before. \n\nThen, the door opened, and Razumihin came in. \"Ah, he’s eating, so he’s not sick,\" said Razumihin. He sat down at the table across from Raskolnikov. He looked worried but tried to hide it. He spoke with clear annoyance but didn’t rush or raise his voice. He seemed to have something important on his mind.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a mix of unease and relief as he grapples with his conscience and the impending funeral of Katerina Ivanovna."
