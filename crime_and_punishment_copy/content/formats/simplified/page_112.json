  "text": "And there was the fourth floor, here was the door, and here was the empty flat across the hall. The flat below the old woman’s was also empty; the visiting card nailed to the door had been taken down—they had left! \n\nHe was out of breath. For a moment, he thought, “Should I go back?” But he didn’t answer himself and started listening at the old woman’s door. It was completely silent. Then he listened again on the staircase, paying close attention for a long time. He looked around one last time, gathered himself, stood tall, and tried the axe in the noose again. “Am I very pale?” he wondered. “Am I obviously nervous? She might be suspicious… Should I wait a little longer until my heart stops racing?”\n\nBut his heart kept pounding. In fact, it thumped even harder, almost to annoy him. He couldn’t take it anymore, so he slowly reached out and rang the bell. Half a minute later, he rang again, this time louder. \n\nNo answer. Ringing again would be pointless. The old woman was likely home, but she was suspicious and alone. He knew a bit about her habits… so he put his ear to the door again. Either his senses were unusually sharp (which is hard to believe), or he really heard something clear. Suddenly, he heard what sounded like a cautious hand touching the lock and the rustle of a skirt right by the door. Someone was quietly standing close to the lock, just like he was outside, and seemed to be listening inside, with her ear against the door. He moved a little on purpose and mumbled something out loud so she wouldn’t hear him.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist, agitated and conflicted, prepares to confront the old woman while grappling with his own anxiety and the weight of his intentions."
