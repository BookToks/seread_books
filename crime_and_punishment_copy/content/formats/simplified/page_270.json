Suddenly, her thin arms hugged him tightly, and her head rested on his shoulder as she softly cried, pressing her face against him.  \n“I am sorry for father,” she said a moment later, lifting her tear-streaked face and wiping away her tears with her hands. “It’s nothing but bad luck now,” she added suddenly, trying to sound grown-up.  \n“Did your father love you?”  \n“He loved Lida the most,” she said very seriously, without a smile, just like adults do. “He loved her because she is little and sick too. He always brought her presents. But he taught us to read and me grammar and scripture too,” she added proudly. “And mother never said anything, but we knew she liked it, and father knew it too. And mother wants to teach me French because it’s time for my education to start.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Polenka expresses her deep love for her sister Sonia and reflects on her family's misfortunes and her father's affections."
