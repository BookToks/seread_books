  "text": "We want to translate and publish books. I can help because I have experience. For almost two years, I've been working with publishers, and I know how everything works. You don’t need to be perfect to make money, trust me! We shouldn’t miss our chance! I know of two or three books that could earn us a hundred roubles just by thinking about translating and publishing them. I wouldn’t even sell the idea of one for five hundred roubles. If I told a publisher, they might hesitate because they can be so slow to understand! But for the business side—printing, paper, selling—you can count on me; I know what to do. We’ll start small and grow bigger. Either way, it will help us earn a living and get our money back.\n\nDounia’s eyes lit up.  \n“I like what you’re saying, Dmitri Prokofitch!” she said.  \n“I don’t know much about it,” said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, “it might be a good idea, but who knows? It’s new and untested. We should stay here for a while.” She looked at Rodya.  \n“What do you think, brother?” Dounia asked.  \n“I think he has a great idea,” Rodya replied. “It’s too early to think about starting a publishing company, but we could definitely publish five or six books and be successful. I know one book that would do really well. And I’m sure he can handle it; he knows the business. But we can discuss it more later…”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The characters discuss the potential of starting a publishing venture, highlighting their confidence in its success and the experience of one member in the business."
