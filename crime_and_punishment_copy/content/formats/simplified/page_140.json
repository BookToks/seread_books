Why today?\" he thought, feeling confused and scared. \"Oh God, I just want this to be over!\"\n\nHe tried to pray by getting on his knees, but then he laughed — not because prayer was funny, but because he found himself amusing. \n\nHe started to get dressed quickly. \"If I'm going to be lost, then I’m lost. I don’t care! Should I put on this sock?\" he suddenly thought. \"It'll just get dirtier and the marks will disappear.\"\n\nBut as soon as he put it on, he took it off in disgust and fear. He realized he had no other socks, so he picked it up and put it back on — and laughed again. \n\n\"That’s all just a way of looking at things,\" he thought for a moment, even though he was shaking all over. \"There, I got it on! I managed to put it on!\"\n\nBut his laughter quickly turned into despair. \n\n\"No, this is too much for me...\" he thought. His legs were shaking. \"It's from fear,\" he muttered. His head was spinning and hurting from fever. \"This is a trap! They want to trick me and confuse me,\" he thought as he went out onto the stairs. \"The worst part is I'm almost dizzy... I might say something really stupid...\"\n\nOn the stairs, he remembered he was leaving everything just as it was in the hole in the wall. \"They'll probably search it while I'm gone,\" he thought.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist experiences intense anxiety and despair as he prepares to confront the police, reflecting on his fear and confusion."
