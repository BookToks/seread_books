  "text": "He went out, leaving Sonia feeling anxious and uncertain. \n\nLater that evening, at twenty past eleven, he made another strange and unexpected visit. It was still raining hard. Soaking wet, he walked into the small apartment where his fiancée's parents lived, on Third Street in Vassilyevsky Island. He knocked for a while before someone let him in, and his visit initially caused a lot of worry. However, Svidrigaïlov could be very charming when he wanted to be, so the parents quickly stopped thinking he was drunk and out of control. \n\nThe weak father was brought in to see Svidrigaïlov by the caring and sensible mother. She started the conversation with many unrelated questions. She never asked anything directly. Instead, she smiled and rubbed her hands, and when she needed to find out something—like when Svidrigaïlov wanted to have the wedding—she would ask excited questions about Paris and life at the court. Only after a while would she steer the conversation back to Third Street. Usually, this was impressive, but this time Arkady Ivanovitch seemed really impatient and insisted on seeing his fiancée right away, even though he had been told she was already in bed. The girl soon came out. \n\nSvidrigaïlov immediately told her that he had to leave Petersburg for some important matters.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov unexpectedly visits the parents of his betrothed, causing initial confusion before insisting on seeing her."
