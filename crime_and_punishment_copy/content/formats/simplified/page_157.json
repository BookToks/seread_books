  "text": "“Did you go out yesterday?”  \n“Yes.”  \n“Even though you were sick?”  \n“Yes.”  \n“At what time?”  \n“About seven.”  \n“And where did you go, if I may ask?”  \n“Just along the street.”  \n“Short and clear.”  \n\nRaskolnikov, looking pale as a sheet, answered quickly, without looking away from Ilya Petrovitch's gaze.  \n“He can hardly stand up. And you...” Nikodim Fomitch started to say.  \n“It doesn’t matter,” Ilya Petrovitch said in a strange way.  \n\nNikodim Fomitch wanted to say more, but when he saw the head clerk staring at him, he kept quiet. There was an awkward silence. It felt odd.  \n“Alright then,” Ilya Petrovitch said, “we won’t keep you.”  \n\nRaskolnikov left. He heard people talking eagerly as he walked out, and among them, he caught Nikodim Fomitch's questioning voice. Outside, he felt better.  \n“There will be a search right away,” he kept telling himself as he hurried home. “They suspect me!”  \nHis earlier fear returned completely.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, feeling faint and anxious, leaves a tense interrogation where he senses suspicion and anticipates a search at his home."
