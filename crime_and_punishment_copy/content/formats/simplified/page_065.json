  "text": "There is no doubt about Mr. Luzhin. The main thing is he is \"a man of business and seems kind.\" It was nice of him to send the bags and big box for them! He seems like a kind man after that! But his bride and her mother will have to ride in a peasant's cart covered with a sack (I know because I’ve been in one). It doesn’t matter! It’s only ninety versts, and then they can \"travel very comfortably, third class,\" for a thousand versts! That makes sense. You have to live within your means, but what about you, Mr. Luzhin? She is your bride… and you must know that her mother has to borrow money from her pension for the trip. \n\nOf course, it’s a business deal, a partnership for mutual benefit, with shared costs; they provide food and drink, but have to pay for their own tobacco. The businessman has outsmarted them too. The luggage will cost less than their tickets and might even be free. How come they don’t see this, or do they not want to? And they are happy, happy! And to think this is just the beginning, and the real challenges are yet to come! But what really matters is not just the stinginess or meanness, but the whole feeling of it. This sets the tone for their marriage; it’s a preview of what’s to come. And why is the mother being so generous? What will she have by the time she gets to Petersburg? Three silver roubles or two \"paper ones,\" as she calls them… that old woman… hmm. What does she think she will live on in Petersburg after that? She already has reasons to believe she won’t be able to stay with Dounia after the wedding, even for the first few months. The good man has probably let something slip about that.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Mr. Luzhin's apparent kindness is overshadowed by the practical and meager realities of his engagement to Dounia and her mother's financial struggles."
