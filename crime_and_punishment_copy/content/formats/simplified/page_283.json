  "text": "Avdotya Romanovna looked at Razumihin with interest. Her dark eyes sparkled, and Razumihin was surprised by her look. \n\nPulcheria Alexandrovna felt overwhelmed. She whispered to Razumihin in despair, “Nothing would make me leave. I’ll stay here and take Dounia home.” \n\n“You’ll ruin everything,” Razumihin whispered back, losing his patience. “Just come out to the stairs. Nastasya, bring a light! I promise you, he almost attacked the doctor and me this afternoon! Do you get it? Even the doctor had to back off to avoid making him angry. I stayed downstairs to watch, but he got ready and slipped away. He’ll do it again if you upset him at this hour and might hurt himself…” \n\n“What are you talking about?” \n\n“And Avdotya Romanovna can’t be left alone in those lodgings. Think about where you’re staying! That awful Pyotr Petrovitch couldn’t find you a better place… But I’ve had a little to drink, so don’t mind what I say…” \n\n“But I’ll go to the landlady,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna insisted. “I’ll ask her to find a place for Dounia and me for the night. I can’t leave him like this!” \n\nThis talk happened on the landing just outside the landlady’s door. Nastasya was lighting their way from a step below. Razumihin was very excited.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin urges Pulcheria Alexandrovna to leave Raskolnikov alone for the night to avoid further irritation."
