  "text": "Sonia visited Raskolnikov regularly, even though he was often unwilling to talk and acted rudely towards her. Eventually, these visits became a habit for him, and he felt upset when she was sick and couldn’t come. She would see him on holidays at the prison gates or in the guard-room for a few minutes. On workdays, she visited him at his job in the workshops, brick kilns, or sheds by the Irtish River.\n\nSonia wrote about making friends in town and doing sewing work. Since there weren’t many dressmakers, people relied on her in many homes. However, she didn’t mention that the authorities were keeping an eye on Raskolnikov through her and that his work was made easier.\n\nFinally, Sonia shared that Raskolnikov was isolating himself from everyone. His fellow prisoners didn’t like him, and he was silent for days, becoming very pale. In her last letter, she said he had gotten seriously ill and was in the hospital ward for convicts.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's isolation and declining health in prison distress Sonia, who remains devoted to him despite her own struggles."
