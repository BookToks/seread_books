  "text": "Mr. Svidrigaïlov was very rude to Dounia and made mean jokes at the dinner table. I don’t want to share all those painful details to avoid worrying you since it’s all over now. \n\nEven though Marfa Petrovna, Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s wife, and the rest of the household were kind, Dounia had a tough time. Things got worse when Mr. Svidrigaïlov drank too much. \n\nLater, it turned out that he had feelings for Dounia from the start but hid it by being rude. He might have felt ashamed because he was older and had a family, which made him angry at Dounia. He probably thought being mean would hide his feelings from others. \n\nEventually, he lost control and made Dounia a shameful proposal, promising her many things and even offering to take her away to another place or abroad. Just imagine what she went through! \n\nLeaving her job right away was impossible, not just because of money issues, but also to protect Marfa Petrovna’s feelings. If Dounia left, it would have caused problems in the family and a huge scandal for her. There were many reasons why Dounia couldn’t escape that awful situation.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia endured a difficult situation with Mr. Svidrigaïlov, who concealed his passion for her under rudeness and ultimately made her an indecent proposal."
