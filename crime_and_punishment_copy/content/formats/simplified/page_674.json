  "text": "A group of people was laughing and shouting at a mother and her child. They said things like, “She deserves it! She shouldn’t have brought her children!” I didn’t care if that made sense or not. I quickly came up with a plan, sat down next to the mother, and told her that I was also a stranger. I said that the people here were rude and didn’t know how to treat decent folks with respect. I made it clear that I had a lot of money and offered to take them home in my carriage.\n\nI took them home and got to know them better. They were living in a small, sad place and had just arrived from the countryside. The mother said she and her daughter felt honored to meet me. I learned that they didn’t have anything and had come to the city for some legal matters. I offered to help them with money and my services. They had gone to the dance hall by mistake, thinking it was a real dance class. I offered to help the girl learn French and how to dance. They were excited and accepted my help, and we became friends. If you want, we can visit them, but not right now.\n\n“Stop! Enough of your disgusting stories, you horrible man!” \n\n“You’re just like Schiller! Where will virtue hide? I tell you these things just to hear you react!” \n\n“I guess I look ridiculous,” Raskolnikov said angrily.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov recounts his manipulative encounter with a mother and daughter, highlighting his depravity and the absurdity of their situation."
