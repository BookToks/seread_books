  "text": "\"Okay, I’ll come,\" Lizaveta said, still thinking, and she started to walk away slowly. \n\nRaskolnikov had just walked by and didn’t hear anything more. He moved quietly, trying to catch every word. At first, he was shocked, but then he felt a wave of fear, like a chill down his back. He had suddenly discovered that the next day at seven o’clock, Lizaveta, the old woman’s sister and only friend, would be out. This meant that at exactly seven o’clock, the old woman would be alone.\n\nHe was only a few steps from his home. He entered as if he had been sentenced to death. He couldn’t think about anything; he just felt that he had lost his freedom to think and that everything was now decided. \n\nIf he had to wait for years for the right chance, he couldn’t have hoped for a better opportunity than the one that had just come up. It would have been hard to find out in advance, with certainty and less risk, that the next day at a specific time, the old woman he was thinking about would be at home and completely alone.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov realizes that Lizaveta will be away the next day, leaving the old woman alone, which solidifies his plan for murder."
