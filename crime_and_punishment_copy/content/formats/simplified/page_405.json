I wouldn’t say no exactly.’  \n‘Do you see them, then?’  \n\nSvidrigaïlov looked at him strangely.  \n‘Marfa Petrovna likes to visit me,’ he said, making a weird smile.  \n‘What do you mean “she likes to visit you”?’  \n‘She has come three times. I saw her first on the day of the funeral, an hour after she was buried. That was the day before I left to come here. The second time was the day before yesterday, at dawn, at the station of Malaya Vishera, and the third time was two hours ago in my room. I was alone.’  \n\n‘Were you awake?’  \n‘Totally awake. I was wide awake every time. She comes, talks to me for a minute, and leaves through the door—always through the door. I can almost hear her.’  \n\n‘What made me think something like that was happening to you?’ Raskolnikov said suddenly.  \nAt the same time, he was surprised he said it. He was very excited.  \n‘What! Did you think that?’ Svidrigaïlov asked in shock. ‘Did you really? Didn’t I say we had something in common, huh?’  \n‘You never said that!’ Raskolnikov shouted angrily.  \n‘Didn’t I?’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov claims to have seen the ghost of Marfa Petrovna multiple times since her funeral, which intrigues Raskolnikov."
