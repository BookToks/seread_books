  "text": "Svidrigaïlov realized he was involved in something interesting. He got up and walked out of the room. A minute later, he was outside.\n\nA thick mist covered the town. Svidrigaïlov walked on the slippery, dirty wooden sidewalk toward the Little Neva. He imagined the water swollen from the night, Petrovsky Island, and the wet paths, grass, trees, and bushes. He started to stare at the houses, trying to think about something else. The street was empty; there were no cab drivers or people walking by. The bright yellow wooden houses looked dirty and sad with their shutters closed. The cold and damp made him shiver. He occasionally stopped to read shop signs. Finally, he reached the end of the wooden sidewalk and came to a big stone house. A dirty, shivering dog crossed his path, scared and with its tail down. A man in a coat lay face down on the sidewalk, drunk. Svidrigaïlov glanced at him and kept walking. He saw a tall tower on his left and shouted, “Bah! This is a place. Why should it be Petrovsky? It will be in front of a witness anyway…”\n\nHe almost smiled at this idea and turned into the street with the big house and tower. At the closed gates of the house, a small man leaned against them, wearing a grey soldier’s coat and a copper helmet. He looked at Svidrigaïlov with a sleepy and indifferent expression. His face had a constant look of annoyance.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov walks through a desolate town, contemplating his surroundings and his intentions."
