If you believe in life after death, you might believe in that too.\n\n\"I don’t believe in life after death,\" Raskolnikov said.\n\nSvidrigaïlov seemed deep in thought. \n\n\"What if there are only spiders there, or something like that?\" he suddenly said.\n\n\"He's crazy,\" Raskolnikov thought.\n\n\"We always think of eternity as something huge and endless. But why does it have to be that way? What if it's just a small room, like a dirty bathhouse with spiders in every corner? What if that’s all eternity is? Sometimes I imagine it like that.\"\n\n\"Can you really think of nothing better or more comforting than that?\" Raskolnikov asked, feeling upset.\n\n\"Better? How can we know? Maybe that is fair, and honestly, I would have made it like that,\" Svidrigaïlov replied with a vague smile.\n\nThis terrible answer made Raskolnikov feel cold. Svidrigaïlov looked at him and suddenly started laughing.\n\n\"Just think,\" he said, \"half an hour ago we didn’t know each other and saw each other as enemies. There’s still something between us that’s not settled, but now we’ve moved past it and are talking about big ideas! Wasn’t I right to say we’re similar?\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov and Svidrigaïlov engage in a philosophical discussion about the nature of eternity and the afterlife, revealing their contrasting beliefs."
