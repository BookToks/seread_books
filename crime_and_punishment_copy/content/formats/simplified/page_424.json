Even Pyotr Petrovitch was awake now.\n\n“An hour and a half ago, he came in while I was sleeping, woke me up, and introduced himself,” Raskolnikov said. “He seemed pretty cheerful and relaxed, and he hopes we can be friends. He really wants to meet you, Dounia, and asked me to help set it up. He has a proposal for you, and he told me about it. He also mentioned that a week before she died, Marfa Petrovna left you three thousand roubles in her will, and you can get the money soon.”\n\n“Thank God!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna exclaimed, crossing herself. “Pray for her soul, Dounia!”\n\n“It’s true!” Luzhin said.\n\n“Tell us more!” Dounia urged Raskolnikov.\n\n“Then he said he wasn’t rich and that all the estate went to his children, who are now with an aunt. He also said he’s staying somewhere close to me, but I didn’t ask where.”\n\n“But what does he want to propose to Dounia?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in a worried tone. “Did he tell you?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“What was it?”\n\n“I’ll tell you later.”\n\nRaskolnikov stopped talking and focused on his tea.\n\nPyotr Petrovitch looked at his watch. “I have to go to a business meeting, so I won’t stay here,” he said, sounding a bit annoyed.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reveals to Dounia and their mother that Mr. Svidrigaïlov wishes to propose something to her and mentions an inheritance left to Dounia."
