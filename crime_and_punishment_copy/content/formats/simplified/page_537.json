  "text": "Amalia Ivanovna had to deal with the people who were missing, so she started acting very casually, which the others noticed and didn’t like. This was not a good sign for how things would go. Eventually, everyone sat down.\n\nRaskolnikov arrived just as they came back from the cemetery. Katerina Ivanovna was really happy to see him. She liked him because he was the only educated guest and was going to be a professor at the university in two years. She was also glad he apologized for missing the funeral. She quickly made him sit next to her, with Amalia Ivanovna on her other side. \n\nEven though she was worried about serving the food properly and making sure everyone tried it, and despite her bad cough that seemed worse lately, she whispered to Raskolnikov about her feelings and how upset she was about the dinner not going well. She laughed a lot, especially at her guests and her landlady.\n\n“It’s all that cuckoo’s fault! You know who I mean? Her!” Katerina Ivanovna pointed at the landlady. “Look at her, she’s acting confused because she knows we’re talking about her. Ugh, that owl! Ha-ha! And why does she wear that silly cap?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna expresses her frustrations about the dinner and her guests while eagerly engaging Raskolnikov in conversation."
