  "text": "Mr. Luzhin looked like he was in his mid-thirties. His dark sideburns framed his clean-shaven chin nicely. Even though his hair had some grey and was styled at a hairdresser’s, he didn't look silly like most people with curled hair do. If there was something off-putting about his good-looking face, it came from other reasons. After looking at Mr. Luzhin without any politeness, Raskolnikov smiled in a mean way, lay back on his pillow, and stared at the ceiling again.\n\nBut Mr. Luzhin stayed calm and decided to ignore the weirdness around him. \n\n“I’m really sorry to see you like this,” he said, breaking the silence with some effort. “If I had known you were sick, I would have come sooner. But you know how busy work can be. I have an important legal matter in the Senate, plus other things to deal with. I’m expecting your mom and sister to arrive any minute.”\n\nRaskolnikov moved as if he wanted to say something, showing some excitement on his face. Mr. Luzhin paused and waited, but when nothing happened, he continued, “They should be here any minute. I’ve found a place for them to stay when they arrive.”\n\n“Where?” Raskolnikov asked weakly.\n\n“Very close by, in Bakaleyev’s house.”\n\n“That’s in Voskresensky,” Razumihin added.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov observes Mr. Luzhin's peculiar appearance and demeanor while feeling excitement about the impending arrival of his mother and sister."
