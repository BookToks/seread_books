  "text": "I know you might not believe me, and maybe you shouldn’t believe me at all. I admit it, that's just how I am. But you can see for yourself how much of a bad person I am and how much I am honest.\n\n“When are you going to arrest me?” \n\n“Well, I can let you walk around for another day or two. Think about it, my friend, and pray to God. It’s better for you, trust me.”\n\n“What if I run away?” Raskolnikov asked with a strange smile.\n\n“No, you won’t run away. A regular peasant might run away, or someone who follows trends, but you’ve stopped believing in your ideas already. What would you run away with? And what would you do while hiding? It would be awful and hard for you, and what you really need is a clear place in life, a good environment. If you ran away, you’d just end up back to where you are now. You can’t live without us. And if I put you in prison—let's say for a month or two—you’ll end up confessing on your own, maybe even surprising yourself. You won’t know ahead of time that you’re going to confess. I believe you will decide to “take your suffering.” You might not believe me now, but you’ll come to it yourself. Suffering, Rodion Romanovitch, is a powerful thing. Don’t mind that I’ve gotten bigger; I still know what I’m talking about. Don’t laugh at it.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry Petrovitch suggests to Raskolnikov that he will ultimately confess to his crime as suffering is an inevitable part of his journey."
