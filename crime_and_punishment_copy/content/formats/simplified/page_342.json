  "text": "“Goodness, Dounia,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna said as soon as they were outside, “I actually feel better now that we’ve left. I never thought I would feel this way after yesterday on the train.”\n\n“I’m telling you again, mother, he is still very sick. Can’t you see that? Maybe worrying about us made him worse. We need to be patient; a lot can be forgiven.”\n\n“Well, you weren’t very patient!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna replied, feeling upset. “You know, Dounia, I was watching you two. You look just like him, not just in face but in spirit. You’re both sad, both quick-tempered, both proud, and both kind… He can’t be selfish, Dounia. When I think about what’s coming tonight, I feel so worried!”\n\n“Don’t worry, mother. Whatever happens will happen.”\n\n“Dounia, just think about our situation! What if Pyotr Petrovitch breaks off the engagement?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna said without thinking.\n\n“He wouldn’t be worth much if he did,” Dounia replied sharply and with disdain.\n\n“We were right to leave,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna quickly added. “He was in a rush about something. If he gets out and gets some fresh air... it’s so stuffy in his room. But where can we find fresh air here? The streets feel like closed rooms. Goodness! What a city! … watch out … they’ll crush you—carrying something. Oh, it’s a piano they’re moving, I can’t believe it… look how they push! … I’m really scared of that.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pulcheria Alexandrovna expresses relief at leaving a tense situation, while Dounia remains concerned about her brother's health and the potential fallout from their current circumstances."
