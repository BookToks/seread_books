  "text": "“Rodya, Rodya! It's the same as yesterday again,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna said sadly. “And why do you call yourself a scoundrel? I can't stand it. You said the same thing yesterday.”\n\n“Brother,” Dounia replied firmly and coldly. “You are mistaken. I thought about it last night and realized the mistake. You think I am sacrificing myself for someone else. That’s not true. I am marrying for my own sake because things are tough for me. Of course, I will be happy if I can help my family, but that’s not the main reason for my choice…”\n\n“He is wrong,” he thought to himself, biting his nails angrily. “Proud girl! She won’t admit she wants to do it out of kindness! So proud! Oh, how I hate them all!”\n\n“Actually,” Dounia continued, “I am marrying Pyotr Petrovitch because I see two bad options and I choose the better one. I plan to do everything he expects from me, so I am not lying to him… Why did you smile just now?” She blushed, and there was anger in her eyes.\n\n“All?” he asked with a sneer.\n\n“Within certain limits. The way Pyotr Petrovitch courts me made it clear what he wants. He might think too highly of himself, but I hope he respects me too… Why are you laughing again?”\n\n“And why are you blushing again? You are lying, sister.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia asserts that she is marrying for her own sake rather than out of sacrifice or charity, despite her brother's accusations."
