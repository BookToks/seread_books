  "text": "A clerk, not in a uniform, was getting ready to write at a desk. Another clerk was sitting in a corner. Zametov and Nikodim Fomitch were not there.\n\n\"Is anyone here?\" Raskolnikov asked the clerk at the desk.\n\n\"Who do you want?\" the clerk replied.\n\n\"Ah! I can’t see or hear anyone, but I can sense a Russian... how does that fairy tale go? I’ve forgotten! 'At your service!'” a familiar voice suddenly called out.\n\nRaskolnikov felt a shiver. The Explosive Lieutenant was in front of him. He had just come in from another room. Raskolnikov thought, \"This is fate. Why is he here?\"\n\n\"You’ve come to see us? What for?\" Ilya Petrovitch asked, looking very happy and maybe a bit tipsy. \"If it’s for business, you’re a bit early. It’s just a coincidence that I’m here... but I’ll help as much as I can. What is it, what is it? Excuse me...\"\n\n\"Raskolnikov.\"\n\n\"Of course, Raskolnikov. You didn’t think I’d forget? Don’t think I’m like that... Rodion Ro—Ro—Rodionovitch, right?” \n\n\"Rodion Romanovitch.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov encounters the Explosive Lieutenant at the bureau, feeling the weight of fate as he questions the unexpected meeting."
