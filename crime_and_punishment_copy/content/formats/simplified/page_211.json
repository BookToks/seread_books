But will I bother the sick person by being here and talking?” Pyotr Petrovitch asked Zossimov.\n\n“N-no,” Zossimov mumbled; “you can keep him company.” He yawned again.\n\n“He has been awake for a long time, since morning,” Razumihin said. He seemed friendly, which made Pyotr Petrovitch feel a bit happier, maybe because this messy and rude guy called himself a student.\n\n“Your mom,” Luzhin started.\n\n“Hmm!” Razumihin cleared his throat loudly. Luzhin looked at him, curious.\n\n“That’s fine, keep going.”\n\nLuzhin shrugged his shoulders.\n\n“Your mom started a letter to you while I was visiting her. When I got here, I waited a few days before coming to see you, so I could be sure you knew everything; but now, to my surprise…”\n\n“I know, I know!” Raskolnikov suddenly said, annoyed. “So you are the fiancé? I know, and that’s enough!”\n\nIt was clear that Pyotr Petrovitch was upset this time, but he didn’t say anything. He struggled to understand what was happening. There was a moment of silence.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses impatience upon realizing that Pyotr Petrovitch is his mother's fiancé."
