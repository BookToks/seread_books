  "text": "I don’t know exactly when, but it should be very soon, maybe in a week. It all depends on Pyotr Petrovitch, who will tell us when he has had time to look around in Petersburg. He wants to have the ceremony as soon as possible, even before the fast of Our Lady, if that can be done, or right after if it’s too soon. Oh, how happy I will be to hold you close! Dounia is very excited about seeing you. She joked that she would marry Pyotr Petrovitch just for that reason. She is wonderful! \n\nShe isn’t writing to you now and only asked me to say that she has so much to tell you that she doesn’t want to write yet. A few lines wouldn’t say enough and would only upset her. She sends you her love and many kisses. Even though we will meet soon, I might send you some money in a day or two. Now that everyone knows Dounia is marrying Pyotr Petrovitch, my credit has improved. I think Afanasy Ivanovitch will trust me for up to seventy-five roubles based on my pension, so I might be able to send you twenty-five or even thirty roubles. \n\nI would send you more, but I’m worried about our travel costs. Pyotr Petrovitch has kindly agreed to cover part of the journey expenses, like moving our bags and big trunk with some of his friends, but we need to prepare for some costs when we arrive in Petersburg, where we can't be without any money.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia is excited about her upcoming marriage to Pyotr Petrovitch, and they are planning their journey to Petersburg while managing their finances."
