Then you asked so sadly for some fringe for your trousers. We tried to figure out what kind you wanted, but we couldn’t understand. \n\nNow, let’s get to business! Here are thirty-five roubles; I will take ten of them and give you a report in an hour or two. I will also let Zossimov know, even though he should have been here by now since it’s almost twelve. And you, Nastasya, please check in often while I’m gone to see if he needs a drink or anything else. I’ll talk to Pashenka about what’s needed myself. Goodbye!\n\n“He calls her Pashenka! He’s clever!” Nastasya said as he left. Then she opened the door and listened but couldn’t help but run downstairs after him. She was very curious to hear what he would say to the landlady. She seemed quite interested in Razumihin.\n\nAs soon as she left the room, the sick man threw off the bed covers and jumped out of bed like he was crazy. He had been waiting impatiently for them to leave so he could start working. But what work? Now, it seemed to slip away from him on purpose.\n\n“Oh God, just tell me one thing: do they know about it yet or not? What if they know and are just pretending, making fun of me while I’m stuck here? Then they’ll come in and say it was found out a long time ago, and that they only… What am I supposed to do now? I’ve forgotten everything, like it just vanished all at once.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The sick man is consumed by anxiety and impatience, fearing that his secret has been discovered while he is incapacitated."
