  "text": "Raskolnikov stood in the middle of the street, leaning on the rail and staring into the distance. After saying goodbye to Razumihin, he felt so weak that he could barely make it to this spot. He wanted to sit or lie down somewhere on the street. \n\nHe bent over the water and looked at the last pink light of the sunset, the darkening houses, and one attic window across the canal that looked like it was on fire in the fading sunlight. He noticed the dark water of the canal, which caught his attention. \n\nSuddenly, red circles flashed before his eyes. The houses seemed to move, and everything around him—the people, the canal banks, the carriages—started to dance before him. Then he was startled by a strange and scary sight. \n\nHe noticed a tall woman with a kerchief on her head. She had a long, yellow face and red, sunken eyes. She was staring at him but didn't seem to see him at all. Suddenly, she leaned on the railing, lifted her legs over it, and jumped into the canal. The dirty water swallowed her for a moment, but then she floated to the surface, moving slowly with the current, her head and legs in the water, and her skirt puffed up like a balloon behind her.\n\n“Help! A woman is drowning!” shouted many voices. People rushed over, and both sides of the canal were filled with onlookers. On the bridge, people crowded around Raskolnikov, pushing in close behind him.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, feeling weak and disoriented, witnesses a woman throw herself into the canal, prompting a crowd to react in alarm."
