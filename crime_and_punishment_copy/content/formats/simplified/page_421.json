As for me, I’m being careful and finding out where he’s staying.”\n\n“Oh, Pyotr Petrovitch, you have scared me so much,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna said. “I’ve only seen him twice, but I thought he was awful, really awful! I believe he caused Marfa Petrovna’s death.”\n\n“It’s hard to be sure about that. I have some clear information. I agree that he might have made things worse with his actions, but I also agree with you about his behavior and character. I don’t know if he has money now or what Marfa Petrovna left him. I’ll find out soon. But if he has any money here in Petersburg, he will probably go back to his old bad habits. He is a very corrupt and terrible person. I believe Marfa Petrovna, who unfortunately fell in love with him and paid his debts eight years ago, helped him in another way too. Because of her efforts and sacrifices, a serious crime he committed, which could have sent him to Siberia, was covered up. That’s the kind of man he is, if you want to know.”\n\n“Good heavens!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna exclaimed. Raskolnikov listened closely.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pulcheria Alexandrovna expresses her fear of a man she believes caused Marfa Petrovna's death, while Pyotr Petrovitch describes him as depraved and dangerous, hinting at his criminal past."
