  "text": "I want to see Avdotya Romanovna with your help. If you want, I can explain to her that Mr. Luzhin will only bring her harm. I also want to apologize for any past issues and give her a gift of ten thousand roubles to help her break away from Mr. Luzhin. I think she might want to do that if she sees a way out.\n\n\"You must be crazy,\" Raskolnikov said, surprised rather than angry. \"How can you say that?\"\n\n\"I knew you would react like this. But first, even though I’m not rich, I have this ten thousand roubles to give. I don’t need it, so if Avdotya Romanovna doesn’t take it, I’ll just waste it on something silly. That’s the first point. Second, I feel perfectly fine about this. I’m making this offer without any hidden reasons. You might not believe me, but in the end, both Avdotya Romanovna and you will see the truth. \n\nI did cause your sister some trouble, and I regret it. I just want to help her, not to make up for the bad things I did, but to show that I can do something good. If I had any selfish reasons for this offer, I wouldn’t be so open about it. I wouldn’t just offer her ten thousand when I offered more just five weeks ago. Also, I might be getting married soon, which should show that I have no hidden plans regarding Avdotya Romanovna.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov offers Raskolnikov's sister, Avdotya, ten thousand roubles to help her break away from Mr. Luzhin, claiming it is a selfless act to make amends for past troubles."
