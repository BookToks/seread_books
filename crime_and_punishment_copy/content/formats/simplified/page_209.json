He was about to turn to Razumihin but stopped and looked back at Zossimov. \n\n“This is Raskolnikov,” Zossimov said, nodding towards him. Then he yawned widely and slowly took out a big gold watch from his pocket. He looked at it and then put it back slowly. \n\nRaskolnikov lay quietly on his back, staring at the stranger without saying anything. His face was very pale and looked like he was in pain, as if he had just gone through something really hard. But as the newcomer talked, Raskolnikov started to pay attention, then felt curious, then suspicious and even worried. When Zossimov said, “This is Raskolnikov,” he quickly sat up on the sofa and, with a shaky voice, said, “Yes, I am Raskolnikov! What do you want?” \n\nThe visitor looked him over and said, “I am Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin. I hope my name is not completely unknown to you?” \n\nBut Raskolnikov, who was expecting something different, just stared at him blankly and didn’t answer.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, lying on the sofa, is confronted by the pompous Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, who introduces himself but receives a confused and unresponsive reaction."
