His face was serious, and he seemed very determined.\n\n\"I have cut ties with my family today,\" he said. \"I won’t see my mother and sister again. I’ve completely broken away from them.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Sonia asked, surprised. She had just met his mother and sister, and it had made a strong impression on her. She felt shocked by his news.\n\n\"I only have you now,\" he added. \"Let’s go together... I’ve come to you. We are both cursed, so let’s walk this path together!\"\n\nHis eyes sparkled in a way that made Sonia think he seemed crazy.\n\n\"Go where?\" she asked, feeling scared and stepping back without meaning to.\n\n\"I don’t know. I just know it’s the same road, and that’s all I know. It’s the same goal!\"\n\nShe looked at him, confused. All she knew was that he was very unhappy.\n\n\"No one will understand if you tell them, but I understand. I need you, that’s why I came to you.\"\n\n\"I don’t understand,\" Sonia whispered.\n\n\"You’ll understand later. Haven’t you done something similar? You have also crossed a line... you had the strength to do it. You have harmed yourself; you have destroyed.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confesses to Sonia that he has severed ties with his family and seeks to share a path of despair with her, both feeling accursed."
