I told you last night what I think about these ceremonies. I heard she invited you too. You talked to her yesterday…”\n\n“I never thought that foolish woman would spend all the money she got from that other fool, Raskolnikov, on this feast. I was surprised when I saw all the preparations and the wines! Several people are invited. It’s unbelievable!” Pyotr Petrovitch continued, seeming to have a reason for the conversation. “What? You say I’m invited too? When was that? I don’t remember. But I won’t go. Why should I? I just mentioned to her yesterday that she might get a year’s salary as a poor widow of a government clerk. I guess she invited me for that, right? He-he-he!”\n\n“I don’t plan to go either,” said Lebeziatnikov.\n\n“I wouldn’t think so, especially after you hit her! You might want to think twice, he-he!”\n\n“Who hit whom?” Lebeziatnikov shouted, flustered and blushing.\n\n“You hit Katerina Ivanovna a month ago. I heard that yesterday… so that’s what your beliefs are worth… and the whole woman question isn’t quite right either, he-he-he!” Pyotr Petrovitch said, seeming pleased, and went back to clicking his beads.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pyotr Petrovitch discusses a feast being prepared by a widow, expressing surprise at her spending and revealing past conflicts with others involved."
