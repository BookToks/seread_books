  "text": "**Crime and Punishment**  \n**Chapter II**  \n\nIt was almost eight o’clock. The two young men rushed to Bakaleyev’s to get there before Luzhin.  \n\n“Who was that?” Razumihin asked as soon as they were outside.  \n\n“That was Svidrigaïlov, the landowner whose house my sister worked at as a governess. He bothered her so much that his wife, Marfa Petrovna, kicked her out. Later, Marfa Petrovna asked Dounia for forgiveness, but she just died suddenly. We were talking about her this morning. I don’t know why I’m scared of that man. He came here right after his wife’s funeral. He’s very strange and seems set on doing something… We need to protect Dounia from him. That’s what I wanted to tell you, okay?”  \n\n“Protect her? What can he do to hurt Avdotya Romanovna? Thanks for telling me, Rodya. We will protect her. Where does he live?”  \n\n“I don’t know.”  \n\n“Why didn’t you ask? That’s too bad! I’ll find out, though.”  \n\n“Did you see him?” Raskolnikov asked after a moment.  \n\n“Yes, I saw him, I remember him well.”  \n\n“Are you sure you saw him clearly?” Raskolnikov pressed.  \n\n“Yes, I remember him perfectly. I would recognize him again.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses concern about Svidrigaïlov's intentions towards his sister Dounia after the recent death of Svidrigaïlov's wife."
