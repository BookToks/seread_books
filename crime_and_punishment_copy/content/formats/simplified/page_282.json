  "text": "\"Brother, think about what you're saying!\" Avdotya Romanovna said quickly, but then stopped herself. \"Maybe you're too tired to talk right now,\" she added gently.\n\n\"You think I'm crazy? No... You're marrying Luzhin for my sake. But I won’t accept that. So write a letter to refuse him before tomorrow. Let me read it in the morning, and that will be the end of it!\"\n\n\"I can't do that!\" the girl shouted, upset. \"What right do you have to ask me...?\"\n\n\"Dounia, you're being too quick to react, just be quiet for now,\" their mother said in worry. \"It's better to leave!\"\n\n\"He's out of his mind,\" Razumihin said, sounding drunk. \"How could he dare! Tomorrow all this nonsense will be over. He really did drive Luzhin away today. That's true. And Luzhin got mad, too. He made a big show of his knowledge and then left feeling down.\"\n\n\"Is that true?\" Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked.\n\n\"Goodbye until tomorrow, brother,\" Dounia said kindly. \"Let's go, mother... Goodbye, Rodya.\"\n\n\"Do you hear me, sister?\" he called after them, trying hard to speak. \"I'm not crazy; this marriage is terrible. Let me be the bad one, but you shouldn't be. One of us is enough... and even though I'm bad, I wouldn't want a sister like that. It's me or Luzhin! Go now...\"\n\n\"But you're not thinking straight! You're a tyrant!\" Razumihin shouted. But Raskolnikov didn’t answer. He lay down on the sofa and turned to the wall, completely defeated.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov insists that his sister Dounia should refuse her marriage to Luzhin, viewing it as a sacrifice he cannot accept."
