He’s doing okay,\" he said slowly. \"Has he eaten anything?\"\n\nThey told him what the patient had eaten and asked what he could have.\n\n\"He can have anything... soup, tea... but no mushrooms or cucumbers, and he shouldn’t have meat either... but you already know that!\" Razumihin and Zossimov exchanged looks. \"No more medicine or anything. I’ll check on him again tomorrow. Maybe even today... but never mind...\"\n\n\"Tomorrow evening I’ll take him for a walk,\" said Razumihin. \"We’re going to the Yusupov garden and then to the Palais de Crystal.\"\n\n\"I wouldn’t bother him tomorrow at all, but maybe just a little... we’ll see.\"\n\n\"Oh, what a hassle! I have a housewarming party tonight; it’s just a short walk from here. Can he come? He can lie on the sofa. Are you coming?\" Razumihin asked Zossimov. \"Don’t forget, you promised.\"\n\n\"Okay, but later. What are you planning to do?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing—just tea, vodka, and herring. There will be a pie... just our friends.\"\n\n\"And who are they?\"\n\n\"All neighbors, mostly new friends, except for my old uncle, who is new too—he arrived in Petersburg yesterday for some business. We see each other once every five years.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Zossimov monitors a patient's condition while discussing plans for a house-warming party with Razumihin."
