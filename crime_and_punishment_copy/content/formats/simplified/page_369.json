  "text": "Many leaders in history, like Lycurgus, Solon, Mahomet, and Napoleon, were considered criminals because they broke old laws that people valued. They often used violence, even against innocent people, if it helped their goals. It's interesting that most of these leaders caused a lot of destruction. \n\nI believe that all great people, or those who want to change things, are criminals to some extent. They need to break away from the usual way of doing things, which they cannot accept. This idea isn't new; it's been said many times before. \n\nI know my idea of dividing people into ordinary and extraordinary might seem a bit random, but I believe people can be grouped into two types. The first group is ordinary people who just follow the rules and are focused on survival. The second group has the ability to create new ideas. There are many sub-groups, but the main differences between these two types are clear. The first group tends to follow the law and live under control.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov argues that all great leaders and innovators are inherently criminals for transgressing established laws to create change."
