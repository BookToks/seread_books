I had a requiem.”  \nRaskolnikov: “For whom?”  \nSonia: “For Lizaveta. She was killed with an axe.”  \n\n---\n\nRaskolnikov's nerves fray, his head spins.  \nRaskolnikov: “Were you friends with Lizaveta?”  \nSonia: “Yes... we used to read and talk.”  \nRaskolnikov: “I’ll be a religious maniac soon!”  \nSonia: “Read!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov urges Sonia to read from the New Testament, revealing their shared connection to faith and loss."
