  "text": "A Tense Conversation Over Tea\n\nA dimly lit room, two men at a table.  \nZametov looks concerned.  \nZametov: \"Crimes lately? A gang of false coiners!\"  \n\nRaskolnikov smirks, sipping tea.  \nRaskolnikov: \"Children, simpletons! Not real criminals.\"  \nZametov: \"Of course they are criminals!\"  \n\n---  \n\nRaskolnikov leans forward, eyes glinting.  \nRaskolnikov: \"Trusting strangers? What a foolish plan!\"  \n\nZametov, puzzled, frowns.  \nZametov: \"Their hands trembled? That's possible...\"  \nRaskolnikov: \"Exactly! One fool brings it all down!\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov dismisses a recent gang of false coiners as simpletons rather than true criminals, highlighting the fragility of their scheme and the risks of dependence on others."
