What does she say?”  \nSvidrigaïlov: “Silliest trifles! It makes me angry.”  \n\n---  \n\nFlashback to Svidrigaïlov’s study, a clock ticking.  \nSvidrigaïlov: “You forgot to wind the clock.”  \nSvidrigaïlov: “I ran away in fright!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov describes his encounters with the ghost of his deceased wife, Marfa Petrovna, who engages him in trivial conversations."
