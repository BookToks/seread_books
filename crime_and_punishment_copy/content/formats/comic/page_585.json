I prefer the darkness.”  \n\n---  \n\nRaskolnikov lies still, lost in thought.  \nDust covers his notebooks.  \nRaskolnikov: “Why am I so stupid?”  \n\nSonia: “You’re not stupid, just lost.”  \nRaskolnikov: “Men won’t change; it’s pointless.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reflects on his isolation and the futility of waiting for others to change, concluding that true power lies in strength of mind and daring."
