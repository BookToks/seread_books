  "text": "What Is Right?\n\nA dimly lit room, two men in conversation.  \nRazumihin looks confused.  \nRazumihin: “What do you mean? That can’t be right?”  \n\nRaskolnikov smiles, intrigued.  \nRaskolnikov: “That wasn’t quite my contention, but…”  \n\nHe leans forward, eager.  \nRaskolnikov: “An ‘extraordinary’ man has the right to overstep.”  \n\n---  \n\nThe atmosphere shifts, tension rising.  \nRazumihin: “What do you mean by that?”  \n\nRaskolnikov’s eyes gleam with conviction.  \nRaskolnikov: “For the greater good, sometimes it’s essential.”  \n\nHe pauses, weighing his words.  \nRaskolnikov: “Even if it costs lives, like Newton’s discoveries.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov argues that extraordinary individuals may have an inner right to transgress moral boundaries for the greater good, but this does not justify indiscriminate wrongdoing."
