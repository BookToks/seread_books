Too proud to admit charity!\"  \n\n---  \n\nDounia: \"I'm marrying for my own sake, not for you.\"  \n\nRodya: \"All?\"  \n\nDounia: \"Within limits. I’ll meet his expectations honestly.\"  \n\nRodya (grinning): \"Why are you blushing again?\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia asserts that she is marrying for her own sake rather than out of sacrifice or charity, despite her brother's accusations."
