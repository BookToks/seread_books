  "text": "A Direct Proposition\n\nDimly lit room, tense atmosphere.  \nRaskolnikov fidgets, Porfiry leans in.  \nPorfiry: “I propose you confess. It’s to our advantage.”  \n\nRaskolnikov thinks, brows furrowed.  \nRaskolnikov: “What if you’re mistaken?”  \nPorfiry: “I’m not. Providence sent me a fact.”  \n\n---\nDarkened room, Raskolnikov smirks.  \nRaskolnikov: “Ridiculous! Why confess if I’m safer in prison?”  \nPorfiry: “Words can deceive. Prison may not be restful.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry Petrovitch proposes that Raskolnikov should confess to benefit both of them, despite Raskolnikov's skepticism about the necessity of a confession."
