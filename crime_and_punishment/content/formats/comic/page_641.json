I don’t care.\"  \nPorfiry: \"You must care! Life is still ahead!\"  \n\n---  \n\nRaskolnikov, eyes filled with sorrow  \nRaskolnikov: \"What lies ahead? Just more pain?\"  \nPorfiry: \"Seek and ye shall find hope.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry encourages Raskolnikov to confess, suggesting it could lessen his sentence and lead to redemption, but Raskolnikov expresses indifference towards mitigating his punishment."
