Many people are drawn to her. She is soft and gentle, willing to put up with anything, always ready to help. Her smile is very sweet.’  \n‘You seem to like her,’ laughed the officer.  \n‘Not because of her looks. I’ll tell you this: I could kill that old woman and take her money without feeling guilty at all,’ the student said passionately. The officer laughed again while Raskolnikov shivered. It was strange!  \n‘Listen, I want to ask you something serious,’ the student said eagerly. ‘I was joking, but think about it; we have a stupid, mean, sick old woman who is not just useless but actually causes harm. She doesn’t even know why she is alive, and she will die soon anyway. Do you get it? Do you understand?’  \n‘Yes, yes, I understand,’ the officer replied, watching the excited student closely.  \n‘Now think about this. On the other side, there are many young lives wasted because they need help! A hundred thousand good things could be done with that old woman’s money, which will just be buried in a monastery! Hundreds, maybe thousands, could be saved.’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The student argues that killing a worthless old woman could be justified if her money is used to save many lives."
