He then added,  \n‘I say that because I think there were a lot of promises… so it must be hard to remember them all. But you remember them all so clearly, and…’  \n‘That’s silly! Weak!’ he thought. ‘Why did I say that?’  \n‘But we know everyone who had promises, and you’re the only one who hasn’t come forward,’ Porfiry replied with a hint of sarcasm.  \n‘I haven’t been feeling well.’  \n‘I heard that too. I heard you were really upset about something. You still look pale.’  \n‘I’m not pale at all… No, I’m fine,’ Raskolnikov snapped rudely and angrily, his tone changing completely. His anger was rising, and he couldn’t hold it back. ‘And in my anger, I’ll give myself away,’ he thought again. ‘Why are they making me suffer?’  \n‘Not feeling well!’ Razumihin interrupted. ‘What’s next! He was unconscious and out of it all yesterday. Can you believe, Porfiry, as soon as we left, he got dressed, even though he could barely stand, and ran off to party somewhere until midnight, all out of it the whole time! Can you believe it? Amazing!’  \n‘Really out of it? You don’t say!’ Porfiry shook his head in a very dramatic way.  \n‘That’s nonsense! Don’t believe it! But you don’t believe anything anyway,’ Raskolnikov blurted out in his anger.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov struggles with his emotions and the perception of his health while conversing with Porfiry and Razumihin."
