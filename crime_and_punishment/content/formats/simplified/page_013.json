It was bright because of the setting sun.\n\n‘So the sun will shine like this too!’ Raskolnikov thought quickly, scanning the room to remember how it looked. But there was nothing special in the room. The old yellow wooden furniture included a sofa with a big curved back, an oval table in front of it, a dressing table with a mirror between the windows, chairs along the walls, and a few cheap prints in yellow frames showing German girls with birds. In one corner, a light was burning in front of a small icon. Everything was very clean; the floor and furniture were shiny, with no dust anywhere.\n\n‘Lizaveta must have cleaned this,’ Raskolnikov thought. There wasn’t a speck of dust in the whole flat.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov visits an old woman to pawn something, feeling uneasy due to her mistrust and observing the cleanliness of her modest flat."
