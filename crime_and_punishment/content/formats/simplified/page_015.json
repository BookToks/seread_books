The young man stood alone in the middle of the room, listening and thinking. He could hear her unlocking the chest of drawers. \n\n“It must be the top drawer,” he thought. “She keeps the keys in her right pocket, all on one ring. There’s one key that’s much bigger than the others, with deep notches; that can’t be for the chest of drawers. There must be another chest or strong-box. That’s good to know. Strong-boxes usually have keys like that. But this is all so humiliating.” \n\nThe old woman came back. \n\n“Here, sir: since we say ten copecks for a rouble a month, I must take fifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance. And for the two roubles I lent you before, you owe me twenty copecks in advance. That makes thirty-five copecks altogether. So I must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the watch. Here it is.” \n\n“What? Only a rouble and fifteen copecks now?” \n\n“Yes.” \n\nThe young man didn’t argue and took the money. He looked at the old woman and didn’t rush to leave, as if he still wanted to say something.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The young man reluctantly pawns a watch to the old woman, contemplating her keys and the potential secrets they hold."
