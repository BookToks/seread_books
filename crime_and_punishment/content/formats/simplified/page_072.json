  "text": "The girl was walking unsteadily, stumbling from side to side. She finally caught Raskolnikov's full attention. He reached the seat just as she dropped down onto it, letting her head fall back and closing her eyes, clearly very tired. When he looked closely, he saw she was completely drunk. It was a strange and shocking sight. He could hardly believe it. \n\nIn front of him was a young girl, maybe sixteen or even younger. She had a pretty face, but it looked flushed and swollen. She seemed hardly aware of what she was doing. She crossed her legs in a way that showed she didn't realize she was in public.\n\nRaskolnikov didn't sit down, but he didn't want to leave her either. He stood in front of her, confused. This boulevard was usually quiet, and now, at two o'clock in the heat, it was empty. However, across the boulevard, about fifteen steps away, a man was standing on the edge of the sidewalk. He also seemed interested in the girl for his own reasons. He had likely seen her from a distance and followed her, but now Raskolnikov was blocking his way. The man looked at Raskolnikov angrily but tried to ignore him, waiting impatiently for him to leave. His intentions were clear. The man was plump, well-dressed, around thirty years old, with a bright red face.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov encounters a young, drunk girl on a deserted boulevard and feels compelled to protect her from a lurking gentleman with questionable intentions."
