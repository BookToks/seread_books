  "text": "**Crime and Punishment  \nTranslator’s Preface**\n\nA few words about Dostoevsky might help English readers understand his work.\n\nDostoevsky was the son of a doctor. His parents worked very hard and were very religious, but they were so poor that they lived with their five kids in just two rooms. In the evenings, the mom and dad read serious books to their children.\n\nDostoevsky was often sick and weak, but he still finished third in his final exams at the Petersburg school of Engineering. There, he started his first work, \"Poor Folk.\"\n\nThis story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his magazine and was very well received. The shy, unknown young man quickly became somewhat famous. A bright and successful future seemed to be ahead of him, but those hopes were soon crushed. In 1849, he was arrested.\n\nEven though he wasn’t a revolutionary by nature or belief, Dostoevsky was part of a small group of young men who met to read Fourier and Proudhon. He was accused of “taking part in talks against the censorship, reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and knowing about plans to start a printing press.” Under Nicholas I.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dostoevsky, despite his promising beginnings and literary acclaim, faced arrest and condemnation due to his involvement in discussions against censorship."
