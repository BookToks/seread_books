  "text": "He remembered his old doubts and confusion, and it felt strange to think about them again now. It was odd and almost funny that he had stopped in the same place as before, as if he could still care about the same ideas and images that interested him not long ago. This made him feel sad. Deep down, he felt like everything from his past—his old thoughts, problems, and memories—was far away and hidden. It was like he was flying up and everything was disappearing from view. \n\nWithout thinking, he noticed the coin in his hand. He opened his hand, looked at the coin, and then threw it into the water. After that, he turned and went home. At that moment, he felt completely cut off from everyone and everything.\n\nBy the time he got home, it was evening, so he must have been walking for about six hours. He didn’t remember how he got back. When he undressed, he felt shaky like a tired horse. He lay down on the sofa, covered himself with his coat, and quickly fell asleep.\n\nHe was woken up by a terrifying scream. It was such a horrible sound! He had never heard anything like it—screaming, crying, hitting, and shouting. He couldn’t have imagined such violence and madness. Terrified, he sat up in bed, feeling like he might faint from the pain.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist reflects on his past and feels a profound disconnection from his former self before being jolted awake by a horrifying scream."
