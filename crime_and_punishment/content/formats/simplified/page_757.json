  "text": "He was very anxious and felt like he was making sacrifices that led nowhere. It didn't comfort him that after eight years he would only be thirty-two and could start a new life. He wondered what he had to live for and what he was looking forward to. Why should he try hard? Living just to exist wasn’t enough for him. He had often thought about giving up his life for an idea, a hope, or even a dream. He always wanted more from life. Maybe he believed he deserved more than others because of how strong his desires were.\n\nHe wished he could feel true regret—deep regret that would hurt his heart and keep him awake at night, the kind of regret that makes you think about terrible things like hanging or drowning. He would have welcomed that pain because at least it would mean he was alive. But he didn’t regret his crime.\n\nHe could have found some relief in being angry at his own mistakes, like he had been angry about the silly errors that got him sent to prison. But now, in prison, he thought about his actions again and didn’t see them as foolish or silly as he had before. He asked himself how his beliefs were any more foolish than others that have existed throughout history.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist grapples with existential despair and a lack of repentance for his crime, questioning the value of mere existence."
