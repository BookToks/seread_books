She was a peasant woman from the countryside and loved to chat.\n\n\"Praskovya Pavlovna wants to complain to the police about you,\" she said.\n\nHe frowned. \"To the police? What does she want?\"\n\n\"You don't pay her money, and you won't leave the room. That's what she wants, for sure.\"\n\n\"That's the last straw,\" he muttered, grinding his teeth. \"No, that won't work for me... not now. She's a fool,\" he added out loud. \"I'll go talk to her today.\"\n\n\"She is a fool, that's for sure, just like me. But if you're so smart, why do you just lie here and do nothing? You used to go out and teach kids. Why don't you do anything now?\"\n\n\"I am doing...\" Raskolnikov started, sounding unhappy and unwilling.\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"Work...\"\n\n\"What kind of work?\"\n\n\"I am thinking,\" he said seriously after a pause.\n\nNastasya burst out laughing. She was the type to laugh a lot, and when something amused her, she laughed quietly, shaking and quivering until she felt sick.\n\n\"And have you made much money from your thinking?\" she finally managed to say.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is confronted by Nastasya about his lack of action and financial troubles, leading him to defensively claim he is \"thinking\" as his work."
