  "text": "The landlady was still crying and moaning, and then her door slammed shut. The crowd moved from the stairs to their rooms, talking loudly, arguing, calling to each other, and sometimes whispering. There were many of themâ€”almost everyone living in the building. \"But how could this happen? And why did he come here?\" \n\nRaskolnikov fell onto the sofa, feeling exhausted, but he couldn't sleep. He lay there for half an hour, feeling a deep fear like he had never felt before. Suddenly, a bright light came into his room. Nastasya entered with a candle and a plate of soup. She looked at him closely to make sure he was awake, then placed the candle on the table and started to set out what she brought: bread, salt, a plate, and a spoon. \n\n\"You haven't eaten anything since yesterday. You've been walking around all day, and you're shaking with fever,\" she said.\n\n\"Nastasya, why were they beating the landlady?\" he asked.\n\nShe looked at him carefully. \"Who beat the landlady?\" \n\n\"Just now... half an hour ago, Ilya Petrovitch, the assistant superintendent, on the stairs. Why was he treating her like that, and why was he here?\" \n\nNastasya stared at him, silent and frowning, for a long time. He felt uneasy and scared under her intense gaze. \n\n\"Nastasya, why don't you say anything?\" he finally asked in a weak voice.\n\n\"It's the blood,\" she answered softly, as if it was a secret.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is consumed by terror and confusion after hearing a violent incident involving his landlady."
