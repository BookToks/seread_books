  "text": "Raskolnikov felt a mix of strong emotions, but he was also very tired. His face looked twisted, like he had just had a fit. He was getting more and more exhausted. Any little shock or annoying thing would wake him up again, but he would quickly lose his strength once it stopped.\n\nZametov sat alone for a long time, deep in thought. Raskolnikov had unknowingly changed how he thought about something important, and now Zametov had made up his mind.\n\n“Ilya Petrovitch is an idiot,” he decided.\n\nRaskolnikov barely opened the door of the restaurant when he bumped into Razumihin on the steps. They didn’t see each other until they were almost right on top of each other. They stared at each other for a moment. Razumihin looked very surprised, then real anger showed in his eyes.\n\n“There you are!” he yelled loudly. “You ran away from your bed! I’ve been looking for you everywhere! I almost got into a fight with Nastasya because of you. What’s going on? Tell me the truth! Do you hear me?”\n\n“It means I’m sick of all of you and I want to be alone,” Raskolnikov replied calmly.\n\n“Alone? You can hardly walk, your face is pale, and you’re struggling to breathe! You idiot! What have you been doing at the Palais de Cristal? Tell me right now!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses his desire for solitude despite his deteriorating health, prompting concern and anger from Razumihin."
