  "text": "I want to let you know something important. First, would you have guessed, dear Rodya, that your sister has been living with me for the last six weeks? We won’t be apart anymore. Thank God, her suffering is over. But I will tell you everything step by step, so you understand how it all happened and what we have kept from you.\n\nWhen you wrote to me two months ago about how Dounia was having a hard time in the Svidrigraïlovs’ house, and asked me to tell you about it—what could I say in response? If I had told you the whole truth, I’m sure you would have dropped everything and come to us, even if you had to walk all the way, because I know how you are and how you feel. You wouldn’t let your sister be treated badly. I was very worried myself, but there wasn’t much I could do. Plus, I didn’t know all the details myself at that time.\n\nWhat made things harder was that Dounia got a hundred roubles in advance when she became a governess for their family. This was on the condition that part of her salary would be taken out each month, so she couldn’t just leave without paying back the debt. She took that money mainly to send you sixty roubles, which you really needed back then and which you got from us last year. We lied to you then, saying that the money came from Dounia’s savings, but that wasn’t true. Now I’m telling you everything because, thank God, things have suddenly gotten better, and so you can see how much Dounia loves you and what a good person she is.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia has been living with the narrator for six weeks, and her sufferings are over, revealing her deep love for Rodya."
