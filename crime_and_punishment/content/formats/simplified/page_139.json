Later, he remembered waking up a bit and gripping them tightly before falling back asleep.\n\n\"Look at the rags he sleeps with, like he found a treasure...\" Nastasya laughed in a strange way.\n\nHe quickly hid the rags under his coat and stared at her. Even though he wasn't thinking clearly, he felt that no one would act like that if someone was about to be arrested. \"But... the police?\"\n\n\"You should have some tea! I'll bring it,\" she said. \n\n\"No... I’m going. I’ll leave right now,\" he mumbled as he got up.\n\n\"You won’t even make it downstairs!\" she replied.\n\n\"Yes, I will.\"\n\n\"Do what you want.\" She followed the porter out.\n\nHe hurried to the light to check the sock and the rags. \n\n\"There are stains, but they aren't very noticeable; they’re all dirty and worn out. No one who isn’t suspicious would see anything. Thankfully, Nastasya couldn’t notice from far away!\" Then, shaking, he broke the seal on the notice and started reading. It took him a while to understand. It was a regular notice from the local police station.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** He reflects on his fevered state and the rags he clutches, feeling a mix of desperation and defiance as he prepares for a police summons."
