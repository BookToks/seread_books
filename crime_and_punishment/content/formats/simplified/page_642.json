  "text": "\"Crime and Punishment\"\n\n\"The time will be shorter,\" Raskolnikov laughed. \"Are you afraid of the shame that comes with being middle class? Maybe you are scared without even realizing it because you’re young! But you shouldn’t be afraid to turn yourself in and confess.\"\n\n\"Ugh, come on!\" Raskolnikov whispered with disgust, as if he didn’t want to say it out loud. He got up like he wanted to leave but then sat back down, clearly feeling hopeless.\n\n\"Go ahead, if you want! You’ve lost hope, and you think I’m just flattering you; but how long has your life been? How much do you really understand? You created a theory and then felt ashamed when it failed and wasn’t original! It did turn out to be something low, that’s true, but you’re not completely lost! Not at all! At least you didn’t fool yourself for long; you went straight to the worst part right away. How do I see you? I see you as someone who could smile at their torturer while they’re being hurt, if they found faith or God. Find it, and you will live. You really need a change. Suffering can be good too. Suffer! Maybe Nikolay is right about wanting to suffer. I know you don’t believe it—but don’t be too smart; jump into life without thinking too much; don’t be scared—the current will carry you to safety. What safety? I can’t say! I just believe you have a long life ahead of you. I know you think all my words are just a speech I prepared, but maybe you will remember them later. They might help you.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is urged to confess and embrace suffering as a path to finding faith and meaning in life."
