  "text": "Sweat was dripping down him, and his neck was wet. Someone yelled at him when he came out by the canal, “Wow, he’s really been going for it!” \n\nHe felt kind of lost and the more he walked, the worse it got. He remembered feeling worried when he saw there were only a few people by the canal, making him stand out more, and he thought about turning back. Even though he was really tired, he took a longer way home to avoid being seen.\n\nHe wasn’t fully aware of what he was doing when he walked through the entrance of his building. He only remembered the axe when he was already on the stairs. He had a serious problem: he needed to put the axe back without being noticed. He didn’t even think that it might be better to just drop it in someone’s yard later. Luckily, the door to the porter’s room was closed but not locked, which meant the porter might be home. But he was so out of it that he just walked up to the door and opened it. If the porter had asked him, “What do you want?” he might have just handed him the axe. But the porter wasn’t home, so he managed to put the axe back under the bench and cover it with a piece of wood like before. \n\nHe didn’t see anyone else on his way to his room; the landlady’s door was closed. Once he got to his room, he threw himself onto the sofa without changing and didn’t sleep but just lay there blankly.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist, overwhelmed and fatigued, struggles to conceal an axe after a troubling incident while navigating his way home."
