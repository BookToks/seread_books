She was a strange girl who wanted to be a nun. For a moment, he looked at the delicate, expressive face of his fiancée, kissed the portrait, and gave it to Dounia.\n\n\"I used to talk a lot about this to her, only to her,\" he said thoughtfully. \"I shared many things with her that have turned out so badly. Don’t worry,\" he told Dounia, \"she didn’t want this any more than you do, and I’m glad she’s gone. The important thing is that everything is going to change, everything is going to break apart,\" he suddenly said, going back to feeling sad. \"Everything, everything, am I ready for it? Do I even want it? They say I need to suffer! What’s the point of these pointless sufferings? Will I understand why when I’m crushed by hardships and weak like an old man after twenty years in prison? What will I have to live for then? Why am I agreeing to this life now? I knew I was pathetic when I stood looking at the Neva River at dawn today!\"\n\nFinally, they both went outside. It was hard for Dounia, but she loved him. She walked away, but after fifty steps, she turned to look at him again. He was still in sight. At the corner, he turned too, and for the last time, their eyes met. But when he saw her looking at him, he waved her away with annoyance and turned the corner quickly.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist reflects on his past and the inevitability of suffering, questioning the purpose of his impending hardships."
