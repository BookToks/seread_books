They walked side by side for a minute without saying anything.\n\n\"You were asking the porter about me?\" Raskolnikov finally said in a very quiet voice.\n\nThe man didn’t reply or even look at him. They were both silent again.\n\n\"Why do you come to ask for me and not say anything? What does it mean?\" Raskolnikov's voice broke, and he struggled to get the words out.\n\nThis time, the man looked up and gave Raskolnikov a dark, serious look. \n\n\"Murderer!\" he said suddenly in a calm but clear voice.\n\nRaskolnikov kept walking beside him. His legs felt weak, a cold shiver went down his back, and his heart seemed to stop for a moment before racing again. They walked about a hundred steps in silence.\n\nThe man didn’t look at him.\n\n\"What do you mean? Who is a murderer?\" Raskolnikov muttered softly.\n\n\"You are a murderer,\" the man said even more clearly and strongly, smiling with a look of triumph and hatred. He looked right into Raskolnikov’s pale face and scared eyes.\n\nThey had just reached the crossroads.
