What does it matter to you?”  \n“You need a license to play music, and you don’t have one. That’s how you gather a crowd. Where do you live?”  \n“A license?” Katerina Ivanovna cried. “I buried my husband today. Why do I need a license?”  \n“Calm down, ma’am, calm down,” the official said. “Come with me; this isn’t a good place for you. You’re not well.”  \n“Sir, sir, you don’t understand,” Katerina Ivanovna shouted. “We are going to Nevsky… Sonia, Sonia! Where is she? She is crying too! What’s wrong with all of you? Kolya, Lida, where are you going?” she suddenly shouted in worry. “Oh, silly kids! Kolya, Lida, where are you going?”  \nKolya and Lida, scared by the crowd and their mother’s strange behavior, grabbed each other’s hands and ran away when they saw the policeman who wanted to take them somewhere. Crying and upset, Katerina Ivanovna ran after them. She looked pitiful as she ran, crying and out of breath. Sonia and Polenka ran after them.  \n“Bring them back, bring them back, Sonia! Oh, ungrateful children! Polenka! Catch them… I’m doing this for you…”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna, distraught after her husband's burial, frantically searches for her children amidst a chaotic crowd while facing a police official."
