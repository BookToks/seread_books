I chose you for this. I thought about it long ago when your father talked about you and when Lizaveta was alive. Goodbye, don’t shake hands. See you tomorrow!” \n\nHe left. Sonia looked at him like he was crazy, but she felt just as confused. Her head was spinning.\n\n“Good heavens, how does he know who killed Lizaveta? What do those words mean? It’s terrible!” But she didn’t think about it for even a moment. “Oh, he must be really unhappy! He left his mother and sister… Why? What happened? What did he say to her? He kissed her foot and said he couldn’t live without her… Oh, merciful heavens!”\n\nSonia spent the whole night feeling sick and restless. She kept jumping up, crying, and wringing her hands. Then she would fall back into a restless sleep, dreaming of Polenka, Katerina Ivanovna, and Lizaveta, reading the gospel, and him… him with a pale face and burning eyes… kissing her.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia is terrified and confused by Raskolnikov's cryptic knowledge of Lizaveta's murder and his emotional turmoil."
