  "text": "“Mercy! It’s our Afrosinya!” a woman cried nearby, tears in her eyes. “Please, save her! Kind people, pull her out!”\n\n“Get a boat!” people shouted in the crowd. But a policeman ran down the steps to the canal. He took off his coat and boots and jumped into the water. It was easy to reach her; she was floating just a few feet away. He grabbed her clothes with one hand and took a pole from a fellow officer with the other. They pulled the drowning woman out right away. \n\nThey laid her on the stone pavement of the embankment. She soon woke up, lifted her head, sat up, and started sneezing and coughing, wiping her wet dress with her hands. She didn’t say anything.\n\n“She’s drunk and out of her mind,” the same woman cried beside her. “The other day she tried to hang herself, and we saved her. I just ran to the shop and left my little girl to watch her—and now she’s in trouble again! A neighbor, sir, we live close by, the second house from the end, over there…”\n\nThe crowd began to disperse. The police stayed around the woman, and someone mentioned the police station. Raskolnikov watched with a strange feeling of indifference. He felt disgusted. “No, that’s disgusting… water… it’s not good enough,” he muttered to himself. “Nothing will come of it. No point in waiting. What about the police office? And why isn’t Zametov at the police office? It’s open until ten…” He turned away from the railing and looked around.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A woman is rescued from drowning by a policeman while Raskolnikov observes with indifference and apathy."
