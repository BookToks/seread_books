  "text": "“Are you really telling the truth when you say you have proof of this?” Dounia asked firmly and seriously.\n\n“I’m just repeating what Marfa Petrovna told me in secret. Legally, the case was not clear. There is a woman here named Resslich, a foreigner, who lent money at interest and did other jobs. Svidrigaïlov had a long and strange relationship with her. She had a niece, a fifteen-year-old girl who was deaf and dumb. Resslich hated this girl and treated her badly, often beating her. One day, the girl was found hanging in the attic. The investigation said it was suicide. After the usual steps, the case was closed, but later, people said that Svidrigaïlov had done terrible things to the child. This wasn’t clearly proven, and the information came from another German woman with a bad reputation, so it couldn’t be trusted. No one reported it to the police because of Marfa Petrovna’s money and influence; it stayed as just gossip. Still, the story is very important. You probably heard about the servant Philip when you were with them. He died from mistreatment six years ago, before serfdom was ended.”\n\n“I heard that Philip hanged himself.”\n\n“Yes, but the question is what drove him to do that, or maybe what pushed him to that point.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia confronts the unclear circumstances surrounding Svidrigaïlov's alleged involvement in a girl's suicide and the mistreatment of a servant named Philip."
