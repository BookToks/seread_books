I cough, my throat itches, and I have trouble breathing. You know I’m a coward. I went to Dr. B——n recently; he always spends at least half an hour with each patient. He actually laughed at me. He checked my breathing and said, ‘Tobacco is bad for you; your lungs are not healthy.’ But how can I give it up? What else can I do? I don’t drink, and that’s the problem, ha-ha! Everything is connected, Rodion Romanovitch, everything!”\n\n“Ugh, he’s doing his doctor act again,” Raskolnikov thought with disgust. All the memories from their last meeting came back to him, and he felt the same strong emotions he had felt then.\n\n“I came to see you the day before yesterday in the evening; didn’t you know?” Porfiry Petrovitch continued, looking around the room. “I came into this very room. I was passing by, just like today, and thought I’d visit you. Your door was wide open, so I walked in, looked around, and then left without telling your servant I was there. Don’t you lock your door?”\n\nRaskolnikov’s face became more and more serious. Porfiry seemed to sense how he was feeling.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry Petrovitch expresses his struggle with quitting smoking while visiting Raskolnikov, who feels increasingly uneasy during the conversation."
