  "text": "**Crime and Punishment**  \n**Chapter III**\n\n“He is well, quite well!” Zossimov said happily as they walked in. \n\nHe had come in ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the same spot as before, on the sofa. Raskolnikov was sitting in the opposite corner, dressed and clean, which he hadn’t been for a while. The room quickly filled up, but Nastasya managed to come in with the visitors and stayed to listen.\n\nRaskolnikov was almost better compared to how he was the day before, but he still looked pale, tired, and gloomy. He looked like someone who had been hurt or had gone through a lot of pain. His forehead was wrinkled, his lips were tight, and his eyes looked feverish. He spoke very little and seemed to do it out of obligation, and he moved restlessly.\n\nHe looked like he needed a sling on his arm or a bandage on his finger to really seem like a person with a bad injury. His pale, sad face lit up for a moment when his mother and sister came in, but this only made him look even more in pain instead of less sad. The light in his eyes faded quickly, but the look of suffering stayed, and Zossimov, who was eagerly studying his patient like a young doctor, saw that he showed no happiness at his mother’s arrival.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov appears physically better but remains emotionally tormented and listless despite the presence of his mother and sister."
