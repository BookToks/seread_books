  "text": "On a really hot evening in early July, a young man came out of the small room he rented in S. Place. He walked slowly, as if he wasn't sure about something, towards K. bridge. He had managed to avoid meeting his landlady on the stairs. His room was under the roof of a tall, five-story building and was more like a closet than a proper room. The landlady, who gave him the room, meals, and help, lived on the floor below.\n\nAs he walked, an expression of deep disgust showed on his handsome face. He was tall, slim, well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon, he fell into deep thought, or more like a blank mind; he walked without noticing what was around him and didn’t care to see it. Sometimes, he would mumble to himself, stopping on the stairs to listen to his landlady's boring gossip, her annoying demands for money, threats, and complaints. He would have to think hard for excuses, lie, or avoid her entirely. This evening, though, as he stepped onto the street, he felt very aware of his fears.\n\n\"I want to try something like that, but I'm scared of these little things,\" he thought with a strange smile. \"Yes, everything is in a man's hands, but he lets it all slip away because he's afraid. I wonder what men are most afraid of. They fear taking a new step or saying something new the most... But I'm talking too much. Maybe I don’t do anything because I talk too much. I’ve learned to talk a lot this past month, lying around in my room thinking about Jack the Giant-killer. Why am I going there now? Can I really do that? Is it serious? It’s not serious at all. It’s just a fantasy to entertain myself; a toy! Yes, maybe it is just a toy.\"\n\nThe heat in the street was awful, and the stuffy air, the busy streets, the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust around him, along with the familiar awful smell of Petersburg in summer, all made the young man’s already stressed nerves feel worse. The terrible smell from the bars, which were very common in that part of town, and the drunk men he kept seeing, even though it was a workday, added to the horrible feeling of the situation.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The young man grapples with his fears and insecurities while navigating a stifling and unpleasant environment."
