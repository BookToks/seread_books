  "text": "On a very hot evening in early July, a young man came out of the small room where he lived and walked slowly toward K. bridge. He managed to avoid seeing his landlady on the stairs. His room was at the top of a tall building and was more like a closet than a real room. His landlady, who gave him meals and looked after him, lived one floor below.\n\nThat evening, when he stepped outside, he suddenly felt very aware of his fears. \n\n\"I want to try something big, but I’m scared of these little things,\" he thought with a strange smile. \"Yes, everything is in a person’s hands, but they let it all go because they are too afraid, that’s a fact. I wonder what people are most afraid of. They fear taking new steps or saying new things the most… But I’m talking too much. I do nothing because I keep talking. Or maybe I talk because I do nothing. I’ve gotten good at talking this past month, lying around in my room thinking about Jack the Giant-killer. Why am I going there now? Can I really do that? Is it serious? Not really. It’s just a fantasy to entertain myself; just a toy! Yes, maybe it’s just a toy.\"\n\nThe heat in the street was awful. The air was still, and the noise, dust, and bad smells all around him were making his already stressed nerves worse. The terrible smell from the bars in that area and the drunk men he kept seeing, even though it was a workday, added to the disgusting scene.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The young man grapples with his fears and insecurities while navigating a suffocating urban environment."
