  "text": "I gave Zametov a bit of a beating back then—just between us, brother; please don’t tell anyone you know about it. I’ve noticed he gets really sensitive about it. It happened at Luise Ivanovna’s place. But today, everything is clear. That Ilya Petrovitch is behind it all! He took advantage of you fainting at the police station, but he feels bad about it now; I know that.\n\nRaskolnikov listened eagerly. Razumihin was drunk enough to spill too many secrets. \n\n“I fainted because it was so hot and the paint smell was strong,” Raskolnikov said. \n\n“You don’t need to explain! It wasn’t just the paint; you’ve been getting sick for a month. Zossimov can back that up! But that boy is really down now, you wouldn’t believe it! He says, ‘I’m not worth his little finger,’ meaning yours. He has good feelings sometimes, brother. But the way you taught him a lesson today at the Palais de Cristal was amazing! You scared him at first; he almost had a fit! You almost made him believe all that awful nonsense again, and then you just stuck out your tongue at him: ‘So, what do you think of that?’ It was perfect! Now he feels crushed! It was brilliant, really, they deserve it! I wish I had been there! He really wanted to see you. Porfiry wants to meet you too…”\n\n“Ah! … him too … but why did they say I was mad?” \n\n“Oh, you’re not mad. I must have said too much, brother… What surprised him was that only that topic seemed to get to you.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov learns about the impact of his actions on others while discussing a recent incident with Razumihin."
