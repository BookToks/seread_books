  "text": "Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov lives there. He used to find such funny books. I said, “I can’t stay,” because I didn’t want to read. I mostly went in to show Katerina Ivanovna some collars. Lizaveta, the seller, sold me some nice, new, cheap embroidered collars and cuffs. Katerina Ivanovna liked them a lot; she put them on and looked in the mirror, happy with what she saw. \n\n“Please give them to me as a gift, Sonia,” she said. She really wanted them. She wondered when she could wear them. They reminded her of her happier days. She admired herself in the mirror, but she had no clothes of her own and hadn’t for years! She never asks anyone for anything because she is proud; she would rather give away everything. But she wanted these collars so much. I felt bad about giving them to her. \n\n“What use are they to you, Katerina Ivanovna?” I asked. I shouldn’t have said that! She looked at me sadly. She was really upset, not just about the collars but because I refused her. It was sad to see. If only I could take back my words! \n\n“Did you know Lizaveta, the seller?” I asked. \n\n“Yes… Did you know her?” Sonia replied, surprised. \n\n“Katerina Ivanovna is very sick; she has a serious illness and will die soon,” Raskolnikov said after a pause, not answering her question. \n\n“Oh, no, no, no!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna, suffering from rapid consumption, longs for a simple joy in receiving a gift of collars, highlighting her pride and the sadness of her situation."
