  "text": "He rushed to Svidrigaïlov’s place. He wasn't sure what he hoped to get from that man, but he felt like Svidrigaïlov had some kind of power over him. Once he realized this, he couldn’t relax, and now he felt it was time to act.\n\nOn the way, one question kept bothering him: had Svidrigaïlov been to see Porfiry? From what he could tell, he was sure he hadn’t. He thought about Porfiry’s visit over and over; no, he hadn’t gone, of course not.\n\nBut if he hadn’t gone yet, would he? For now, he thought he couldn’t. Why? He couldn’t explain it, but if he could, he wouldn’t have spent so much time worrying about it. Everything troubled him, but he couldn’t focus on it. Strangely, no one would have believed it, but he only felt a small, vague worry about his near future. A much bigger worry was bothering him—it was about himself, but in a deeper way. He also felt very tired mentally, even though his mind was clearer that morning than it had been in a while.\n\nWas it really worth it, after everything that had happened, to deal with these new small problems? Was it worth it to try to make sure Svidrigaïlov didn’t go to see Porfiry? Was it worth investigating?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is troubled by his uncertain relationship with Svidrigaïlov and the implications of his potential visit to Porfiry."
