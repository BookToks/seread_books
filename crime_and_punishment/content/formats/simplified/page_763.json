  "text": "Easter had come. The warm, sunny spring days made the prison ward feel brighter with the open windows. Sonia had only been able to visit him twice when he was sick, and it was hard for her to get permission. But she often came to the hospital yard, especially in the evenings, just to stand for a minute and look up at the ward windows.\n\nOne evening, when Raskolnikov was almost better, he fell asleep. When he woke up, he went to the window and saw Sonia waiting at the hospital gate. Seeing her made his heart ache, so he quickly stepped away from the window. The next day, Sonia didn’t come, and he felt anxious waiting for her. Finally, he was released from prison. When he got back, he heard from other prisoners that Sonia was sick at home and couldn’t go out.\n\nHe felt worried and asked about her. He soon found out that her illness wasn’t serious. Knowing he cared about her, Sonia sent him a note written in pencil, saying she was feeling better and had just a little cold. She promised she would come to see him at work very soon. His heart raced as he read her message.\n\nIt was another warm, sunny day. Early in the morning, at six o’clock, he went to work by the riverbank, where they pounded alabaster and had a kiln in a shed. Only three of them were sent to work. One of the prisoners went with the guard to the fortress.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences deep emotional turmoil and concern for Sonia's health while recovering in prison during Easter."
