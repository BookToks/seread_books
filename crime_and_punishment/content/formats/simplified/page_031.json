  "text": "Katerina Ivanovna wouldn’t let it go. She stood up for the girl. Now, Sonia comes to see us mostly at night. She comforts Katerina Ivanovna and helps her as much as she can. Sonia lives with the Kapernaumovs, who are tailors. Kapernaumov is a man with a bad leg and a cleft palate, and so does his whole family. They all share one room, but Sonia has her own small space separated off.\n\nThe Kapernaumovs are very poor, all with cleft palates. The next morning, I got up, put on my old clothes, and raised my hands to the sky. Then I went to see his excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch. Do you know him? No? Well, he’s a good man. When I told him my story, his eyes looked sad. He said, “Marmeladov, you’ve let me down before, but I’ll give you another chance.” He told me to remember that and then I could leave.\n\nI imagined kissing his feet, but he wouldn’t let me because he’s an important man with modern ideas. When I got home and told them I was back at work and would get paid, everyone got really excited. Marmeladov stopped talking, feeling very emotional. At that moment, a group of drunk people came in from outside, and we heard the sound of a concertina and a child singing a song in the hallway. The room was filled with noise.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marmeladov recounts his struggles and the support of Sonia and Katerina Ivanovna amidst their poverty."
