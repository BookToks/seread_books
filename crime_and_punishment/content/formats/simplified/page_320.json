Why am I scared?\n\n“Oh, Rodya, you wouldn’t believe how unhappy Dounia and I were yesterday!” she suddenly said, eager to respond to him. “Now that it’s all over and we’re happy again, I can tell you. Imagine, we rushed here straight from the train to hug you and that woman—oh, there she is! Good morning, Nastasya! She told us right away that you were lying in a high fever and had just run away from the doctor in a daze, and they were looking for you in the streets. You can’t imagine how worried we were!

They couldn’t get him out until the next day. Of course, we were exaggerating. We almost rushed to find Pyotr Petrovitch to ask for help… because we were all alone, completely alone,” she said sadly, then paused, remembering it was still a bit risky to talk about Pyotr Petrovitch, even though “we are quite happy again.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's sister expresses her concern for him while reflecting on their recent struggles and the relief of being reunited."
