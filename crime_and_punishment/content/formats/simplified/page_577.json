Don’t make me suffer,” he pleaded sadly. \n\nThis was not at all how he planned to tell her, but it happened this way. \n\nShe jumped up, seeming confused, and walked to the center of the room, wringing her hands. But she quickly returned and sat down next to him, her shoulder almost touching his. Suddenly, she gasped as if she had been hurt, cried out, and fell to her knees in front of him without knowing why. \n\n“What have you done—what have you done to yourself?” she said in despair. Then she jumped up, threw her arms around his neck, and held him tightly. \n\nRaskolnikov pulled back and looked at her with a sad smile. “You are a strange girl, Sonia. You kiss me and hug me when I tell you about that… You don’t think about what you are doing.” \n\n“There is no one—no one in the whole world as unhappy as you!” she cried, not hearing him, and then she suddenly started to cry hard. \n\nA feeling he hadn’t felt in a long time filled his heart and softened it. He didn’t fight it. Two tears fell from his eyes and hung on his lashes. \n\n“Then you won’t leave me, Sonia?” he asked, looking at her with a bit of hope. \n\n“No, no, never, nowhere!” Sonia cried. “I will follow you.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia expresses her deep emotional connection to Raskolnikov, vowing to never leave him despite his turmoil."
