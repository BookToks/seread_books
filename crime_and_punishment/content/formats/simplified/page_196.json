You have to be extra careful with them. Oh, you boring people! You don’t get it. You’re hurting yourselves by putting others down. But if you want to know, we actually have something in common.”\n\n“I’d like to know what that is.”\n\n“It’s about a house painter. We’re helping him out of a tough situation! But really, there’s nothing to worry about now. The situation is clear. We just need to work a bit harder.”\n\n“A painter?”\n\n“Haven’t I told you? I only mentioned the start of the story about the murder of the old pawnbroker woman. Well, the painter is involved in it…”\n\n“Oh, I heard about that murder before and found it interesting… partly… for one reason… I read about it in the papers too…”\n\n“Lizaveta was murdered too,” Nastasya suddenly said, looking at Raskolnikov. She had been standing by the door, listening.\n\n“Lizaveta,” Raskolnikov whispered barely above a sound.\n\n“Lizaveta, who sold old clothes. Didn’t you know her? She used to come here. She even fixed a shirt for you.”\n\nRaskolnikov turned to the wall, where he noticed a clumsy white flower with brown lines on the dirty yellow paper. He started counting the petals and looking at their shapes.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The conversation reveals a connection between a house-painter and a murder case involving an old pawnbroker and another victim, Lizaveta."
