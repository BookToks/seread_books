  "text": "Dmitri stayed in the house for about ten minutes and then went out again. He didn’t see Nikolay again and finished the job by himself. Their job was on the same staircase where the murder happened, on the second floor. When I heard all this, I didn’t say anything to anyone—that’s Dushkin’s story—but I found out what I could about the murder and went home feeling very suspicious.\n\nThis morning at eight o’clock, which was the third day, I saw Nikolay come in. He wasn’t completely sober, but he could understand what was said to him. He sat down on a bench and didn’t say anything. There was only one stranger in the bar, a man I knew was asleep on a bench, and our two boys. I asked, “Have you seen Dmitri?” He said, “No, I haven’t.” I asked him, “And you haven’t been here either?” He replied, “Not since the day before yesterday.” I asked, “Where did you sleep last night?” He said, “In Peski, with the Kolomensky men.” \n\nThen I asked him, “Where did you get those earrings?” He said, “I found them in the street,” but he said it in a strange way and didn’t look at me. I asked, “Did you hear what happened that evening, at that hour, on that staircase?” He said, “No, I hadn’t heard,” but he was listening closely, his eyes wide open, and he turned pale. I told him everything, and he took his hat and started to get up. I wanted to stop him. I said, “Wait a bit, Nikolay, won’t you have a drink?” I signaled to the boy to hold the door, and I came out from behind the bar. But he ran out and down the street. I haven’t seen him since. After that, I was sure—it was his doing, clear as day. \n\n“I think so too,” said Zossimov.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dushkin recounts his suspicions about Nikolay's involvement in a murder after observing his strange behavior and evasive answers."
