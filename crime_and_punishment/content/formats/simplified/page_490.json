  "text": "“What a clever person you are!” Porfiry laughed. “You’re hard to catch; you have a strange obsession. So, you don’t believe me? But you do believe me a little; I’ll make you believe everything soon because I really like you and want the best for you.”\n\nRaskolnikov’s lips shook.\n\n“Yes, I do,” Porfiry continued, touching Raskolnikov’s arm kindly. “You need to take care of your health. Plus, your mother and sister are here now; you should think about them. You need to comfort them, but you only scare them…”\n\n“What does that have to do with you? How do you know? Why do you care? Are you watching me and trying to let me know it?”\n\n“Good heavens! I learned it all from you! You don’t see that in your excitement, you tell me and others everything. I also learned some interesting things from Razumihin yesterday. You interrupted me, but I have to say that, despite your cleverness, your suspicion makes you lose sight of the obvious. \n\nFor example, about the bell ringing. I, as an examining lawyer, revealed an important fact, and you don’t see anything in it! If I had any suspicion of you, I wouldn’t have acted like this. I would have first calmed your suspicions and not let you know I knew about that fact. I would have distracted you and then hit you with a big question: ‘What were you doing at the murdered woman’s flat around ten or almost eleven?’”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry suggests that Raskolnikov's suspicious behavior reveals his guilt, while expressing concern for his health and family."
