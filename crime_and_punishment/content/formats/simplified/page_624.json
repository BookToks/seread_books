Sometimes he felt completely worn out. After his talk with Nikolay at Porfiry’s, he felt trapped and hopeless. On the same day as Nikolay’s confession, he had a meeting with Sonia. What happened there was nothing like he had expected; he felt weak right away. He realized he couldn’t keep living with such heavy thoughts alone.\n\nSvidrigaïlov was confusing to him. He bothered him, but not in the same way. He might still have to face Svidrigaïlov. Svidrigaïlov could also be a way out, but Porfiry was different.\n\nPorfiry had explained everything to Razumihin in a psychological way. He was bringing up his annoying psychology again! But how could Porfiry think that Nikolay was guilty after their previous talks? After that private meeting, there was only one way to understand it. During those days, Raskolnikov often thought about what happened with Porfiry; he couldn’t stop thinking about it. They had shared many important words and gestures.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels a renewed sense of struggle and the burden of his guilt becomes increasingly unbearable after recent encounters."
