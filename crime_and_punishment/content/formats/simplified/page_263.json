  "text": "The doctor came in. He was a small, careful old man from Germany. He looked around nervously and went to the sick man. He checked his pulse, felt his head, and with Katerina Ivanovna's help, he unbuttoned the bloody shirt and exposed the injured man's chest. It was cut, crushed, and broken; several ribs on the right side were broken. On the left side, near the heart, there was a big, dark bruise from a horse's kick. The doctor frowned. The policeman said the man got caught in the wheel and was dragged for thirty yards.\n\n“It’s amazing he woke up,” the doctor whispered to Raskolnikov. \n\n“What do you think about him?” he asked.\n\n“He will die right away,” the doctor replied.\n\n“Is there really no hope?” \n\n“Not at all! He’s about to die... His head is badly hurt too... I could bleed him if you want, but it won’t help. He will die in the next five or ten minutes.”\n\n“Then let’s bleed him.”\n\n“If you want... But I warn you, it will be useless.”\n\nJust then, they heard more footsteps. The crowd in the hallway moved aside, and a small, grey old priest came in with the sacrament. A policeman had gone to get him after the accident. The doctor switched places with the priest and exchanged looks with him. Raskolnikov asked the doctor to stay a little longer. He shrugged and stayed.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The doctor assesses a critically injured man, revealing that he is unlikely to survive due to severe injuries."
