He remembered a lot later on. \n\nSometimes it felt like there were many people around him. They seemed to want to take him away, and there was a lot of arguing and talking about him. Then he would be alone in the room, and they had all left, scared of him. Occasionally, they would peek in through the door, whispering and laughing at him. \n\nHe often remembered Nastasya being by his bedside. There was also another person he thought he knew well, but he couldn't remember who it was, which bothered him and sometimes made him cry. Sometimes he thought he had been lying there for a month, while other times it felt like it was all happening in one day. He couldn't remember everything, but he always felt like he had forgotten something important. \n\nHe worried and stressed about it, getting upset or really scared. He tried to get up and leave, but someone always stopped him, and he would fall back into a state of weakness and forgetfulness. Finally, he became fully aware again. This happened at ten o'clock in the morning on a nice day.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a feverish illness marked by delirium, confusion, and a sense of being watched and mocked by others."
