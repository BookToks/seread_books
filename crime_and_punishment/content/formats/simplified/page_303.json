Now, with his old clothes, a rude police officer, his fever, and his worries, he was going crazy. All of this could have made him sick. Ugh! And about Zametov, he's a nice guy, but he talks too much and shouldn't have shared everything last night.\n\n\"Who did he tell it to? You and me?\" \n\n\"And Porfiry.\"\n\n\"Why does that matter?\"\n\n\"By the way, do you have any influence on his mother and sister? Tell them to be more careful with him today.\"\n\n\"They'll be fine!\" Razumihin replied, not wanting to discuss it.\n\n\"Why does he dislike Luzhin so much? Luzhin has money, and she doesn’t seem to mind him... and they probably don’t have any money, right?\"\n\n\"Why do you care?\" Razumihin said, getting annoyed. \"How would I know if they have money? Ask them yourself!\"\n\n\"You're such a fool sometimes! Last night's wine is still affecting you. Goodbye; please thank Praskovya Pavlovna for letting me stay last night. She locked herself in and didn’t respond when I said hello through the door. She was up at seven, and the samovar was brought to her from the kitchen. I didn’t get to see her.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The conversation reveals concerns about a man's mental state and the influence of his family and acquaintances on his well-being."
