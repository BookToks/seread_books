I know you’re a bit of a mess and not very clean. You’re weak and nervous, getting lazy and can’t resist anything—and that’s not good because it leads you down a bad path. You’ve let yourself go so much that I don’t know how you’re still a good doctor. You—a doctor—sleep in a comfy bed and only get up at night for your patients! In a few years, you won’t even get up for them… But that’s not the main point! You’re staying in the landlady’s flat tonight. (It took a lot to convince her!) And I’ll be in the kitchen. So this is your chance to get to know her better… It’s not what you think!

But what am I supposed to do with her?\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin expresses concern about Raskolnikov's deteriorating state and encourages him to connect with a woman who may help him."
