  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nHe thought about his actions and wondered why people found them so terrible. Was it because he committed a crime? He felt okay inside. Yes, he broke the law and caused harm, but he thought that punishing him for just breaking the law was not enough. He believed that many people who took power unfairly should have been punished too, but they succeeded and were seen as right, while he failed and felt guilty.\n\nHe realized he saw himself as a criminal only because he failed and admitted it. He also struggled with the question of why he didn’t kill himself. Why did he just stand by the river and choose to confess instead? Was his will to live so strong that he couldn’t let it go? He thought about Svidrigaïlov, who faced death without fear.\n\nIn his pain, he asked himself this question but couldn’t understand that while he looked into the river, he might have felt deep down that something was wrong with his beliefs. He didn’t see that this feeling could lead to a change in how he viewed life and his chance for a new beginning.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist grapples with the nature of crime, guilt, and the desire for life amidst his internal turmoil and existential questioning."
