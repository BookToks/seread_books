  "text": "I knew you didn't like my beliefs and that you didn't agree with helping people privately, which doesn't really fix anything. I thought you were embarrassed to give such a big amount of money in front of me. Maybe you wanted to surprise her by putting a whole hundred-rouble note in her pocket. I know some nice people like to show off their good deeds like that. \n\nThen I thought you wanted to see if she would thank you when she found it. You probably wanted to avoid the thanks, like the saying goes, \"let your right hand not know what your left hand is doing.\" I had so many thoughts about it that I didn't think much more but still felt it was rude to let you know I knew your secret. \n\nBut then I worried that Sofya Semyonovna might lose the money before she noticed it. That's why I decided to come in and tell her that you put a hundred roubles in her pocket. On my way, I stopped by Madame Kobilatnikov’s to give them the 'General Treatise on the Positive Method' and recommend Piderit’s article and Wagner’s too. Then I came here and found a big mess! Could I really have all these thoughts if I hadn't seen you put the hundred-rouble note in her pocket? \n\nWhen Lebeziatnikov finished his long speech and made his point, he was really tired, and sweat was pouring down his face. Sadly, he couldn't even express himself well in Russian.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The speaker reflects on the complexities of charitable actions and the motivations behind them, questioning the sincerity of private benevolence."
