  "text": "I want to explain how all this confusion started. I know I've caused you a lot of pain, Rodion Romanovitch. I'm not a bad person. I understand how hard it must be for someone who is proud and impatient to be treated this way. I see you as a good person, even if I don't agree with everything you believe. \n\nI wanted to tell you this honestly because I don't want to trick you. When I first met you, I felt drawn to you. You might laugh at that, and that's okay. I know you didn't like me from the start, and you have every reason not to. But I really want to change that impression and show you that I care and have a conscience. I'm speaking honestly.\n\nPorfiry Petrovitch paused for a moment. Raskolnikov felt a wave of worry. The idea that Porfiry thought he was innocent started to make him anxious. \n\n\"It's not necessary to go into every detail,\" Porfiry Petrovitch continued. \"I can’t really do that anyway. There were rumors. I won’t explain how I heard them or how they affected you. My suspicions came from a random event that could have easily not happened. What was it? Well, I don’t think I need to go into that either. Those rumors and that event led me to one conclusion.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry Petrovitch expresses his desire to clarify misunderstandings with Raskolnikov and acknowledges the suffering caused by their interactions."
