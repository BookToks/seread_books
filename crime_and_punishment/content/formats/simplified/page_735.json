It felt like a spark igniting inside him, spreading warmth through his body. Everything inside him softened, and tears filled his eyes. He fell to the ground right there.\n\nHe knelt in the middle of the square, bowed down, and kissed the dirty ground with joy. Then he got up and bowed again.\n\n“Looks like he’s drunk,” a young guy nearby said.\n\nPeople around him laughed.\n\n“He’s going to Jerusalem, saying goodbye to his kids and his country. He’s bowing to the whole world and kissing the streets of St. Petersburg,” added a slightly drunk worker.\n\n“He’s pretty young!” someone else said.\n\n“And a gentleman,” another person said seriously.\n\n“Who knows who’s a gentleman these days?” \n\nThese comments made Raskolnikov pause, and the words “I am a murderer,” which almost came out, faded away. He listened quietly to the remarks and, without looking back, turned down a street towards the police office. On his way, he saw something that didn’t surprise him; he had expected it.
