In one of them, he imagined he was in Africa, in Egypt, at an oasis. The caravan was resting, the camels were lying down peacefully, and palm trees surrounded them in a circle. Everyone was having dinner. But he was drinking cool water from a spring nearby. It was wonderful, blue, cold water flowing over colorful stones and clean sand that sparkled like gold.\n\nSuddenly, he heard a clock strike. He jumped up, wide awake, as if someone had pulled him off the sofa. He quietly tiptoed to the door, opened it carefully, and listened on the staircase. His heart was racing. But everything was quiet, as if everyone was asleep. He found it strange and awful that he had slept so deeply and had done nothing or prepared anything yet. It might be six o'clock already. His sleepiness turned into a frantic rush. But there were only a few things to prepare. He focused hard on remembering everything, and his heart was pounding so fast he could hardly breathe. First, he needed to make a noose and sew it into his overcoat, which would only take a moment. He searched under his pillow and found what he needed.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Haunted by day-dreams and a sense of urgency, the protagonist struggles with his thoughts and preparations for an impending action."
