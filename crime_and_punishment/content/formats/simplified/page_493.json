Don’t you dare!”  \n“Don’t worry about that,” Porfiry said with a sly smile, clearly enjoying Raskolnikov’s reaction. “I just invited you here as a friend.”  \n“I don’t want your friendship! I don’t care about it! Do you hear me? I’m leaving now. What will you say if you plan to arrest me?”  \nHe picked up his cap and walked toward the door.  \n“Don’t you want to see my little surprise?” Porfiry said, playfully grabbing his arm and stopping him.  \nHe seemed more cheerful, which only made Raskolnikov angrier.  \n“What surprise?” Raskolnikov asked, stopping and looking at Porfiry nervously.  \n“My little surprise is behind that door, he-he-he!” Porfiry pointed to a locked door. “I locked him in so he wouldn’t escape.”  \n“What is it? Where? What?”  \nRaskolnikov walked to the door and tried to open it, but it was locked.  \n“It’s locked, here’s the key!” Porfiry pulled a key from his pocket.  \n“You’re lying!” Raskolnikov shouted, furious. “You’re a liar, you fool!” He lunged at Porfiry, who calmly stepped back to the other door.  \n“I see what you’re doing! You’re lying and teasing me so I’ll give myself away…”  \n“Well, you couldn’t give yourself away any more than you already have, my friend.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confronts Porfiry about his suspicions and feels trapped in a psychological game."
