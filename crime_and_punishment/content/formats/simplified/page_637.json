This is a strange and dark situation, something that happens today when people are troubled. They talk about how blood ‘renews’ and preach that comfort is the goal of life. Here we have dreams from books and a heart messed up by ideas. We see someone making a decision, but it’s a special kind of decision: he decided to commit a crime like jumping off a cliff, and his legs shook as he went to do it. He forgot to close the door behind him and killed two people for a theory. After the murder, he couldn’t take the money, and whatever he grabbed, he hid under a stone. \n\nIt wasn’t enough for him to suffer while they knocked on the door and rang the bell. No, he had to go to an empty place, partly out of his mind, to remember the ringing, wanting to feel that cold fear again. Well, we can say that was because he was sick, but think about this: he is a murderer but sees himself as a good person, looks down on others, and pretends to be innocent. No, that’s not what a Nikolay would do, my dear Rodion Romanovitch!’\n\nEverything that was said before sounded like a change of mind, so this was a big shock. Raskolnikov shivered as if he had been stabbed. \n\n‘Then… who is the murderer?’ he asked, breathless and unable to hold back. \n\nPorfiry Petrovitch leaned back in his chair, surprised by the question. \n\n‘Who is the murderer?’ he repeated, as if he couldn’t believe it.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov grapples with his guilt and identity as a murderer while reflecting on the complexities of his actions and theories."
