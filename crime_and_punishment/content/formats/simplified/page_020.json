  "text": "Raskolnikov felt something strange when he noticed a man sitting a little way from him. The man looked like a retired clerk. Raskolnikov thought about this feeling later and believed it was a kind of intuition. He kept looking at the clerk because the clerk was staring at him, wanting to talk.\n\nThe clerk seemed tired of the other people in the room, including the tavern-keeper. He looked down on them, thinking they were not as important or cultured as he was, so he felt it was pointless to talk to them. The clerk was over fifty years old, bald, and a bit overweight. His face was yellowish and bloated from drinking a lot, and his eyes were red and sharp.\n\nThere was something unusual about him; his eyes showed strong feelings and maybe even intelligence, but there was also a hint of madness. He wore an old, ragged black coat with almost all the buttons missing, except for one that he had buttoned to keep a little respectability. His shirt was wrinkled and stained, sticking out from his waistcoat. He didn’t have a beard or moustache, but he hadn’t shaved in so long that his chin looked rough and gray. Despite his messy appearance, he acted in a way that seemed respectable and official. But he was restless and fidgety.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is intrigued by a peculiar retired clerk in a tavern, who exudes a mix of intelligence and madness despite his disheveled appearance."
