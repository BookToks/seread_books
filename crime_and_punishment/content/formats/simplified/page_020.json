  "text": "Raskolnikov felt something strange when he saw a man sitting a little way from him. This man looked like a retired clerk. Raskolnikov often thought about how he felt when he first saw him, almost like he knew something would happen. \n\nThe clerk kept staring at him, wanting to talk. He seemed tired of the other people in the room, including the tavern-keeper. He looked down on them, thinking they were not as important or cultured as he was, so he didn't think it was worth talking to them. \n\nThe clerk was over fifty years old, short, and stout. His face was puffy from drinking too much, and it had a yellowish, greenish color. His eyelids were swollen, but his reddish eyes shone brightly. There was something odd about him; his eyes showed strong feelings, maybe even some intelligence, but there was also a hint of madness. \n\nHe wore an old, ragged black coat with only one button left, which he had buttoned to hold on to a bit of his dignity. His shirt was wrinkled and stained, sticking out from his waistcoat. He didn’t have a beard or mustache, but he hadn’t shaved in so long that his chin looked rough and grey. Despite his messy appearance, he had a serious and official way of acting. Still, he seemed restless and fidgety.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is struck by the peculiar presence of a retired clerk in a tavern, who exudes a mix of intelligence and madness despite his disheveled appearance."
