  "text": "It’s been ten years since I visited Petersburg. We’ve heard about all the new things and ideas in the provinces, but to really understand them, you need to be in Petersburg. I think you can learn a lot by watching young people. And I must say, I’m happy about it.\n\n“Happy about what?” someone asked.\n\n“That’s a big question. I might be wrong, but I think I see clearer ideas, more criticism, and more practicality.”\n\n“That’s true,” Zossimov said.\n\n“Nonsense! There’s no practicality,” Razumihin argued. “Finding practicality is hard; it doesn’t just fall from the sky. For the last two hundred years, we’ve been cut off from real life. Ideas are brewing,” he said to Pyotr Petrovitch, “and there’s a wish for good, even if it’s childish, and you can find honesty, even with many dishonest people. But there’s no practicality. Practicality walks with nice shoes.”\n\n“I don’t agree,” Pyotr Petrovitch said, clearly enjoying the conversation. “Sure, people get excited and make mistakes, but we should be understanding. Those mistakes show their passion for the cause and the tough situation they’re in. If not much has been done, it’s because there hasn’t been much time. I believe something has been achieved already. New ideas and works are replacing our old dreamy authors. Literature is becoming more mature, and many harmful beliefs have been removed.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The discussion highlights differing perspectives on the practicality and progress of ideas and literature in Petersburg's younger generation."
