Where’s the money? Speak!’ \n\nShe started searching him. Marmeladov raised both arms to help her search. There was not a single coin. \n\n‘Where’s the money?’ she yelled. ‘Oh no, did he drink it all? There were twelve silver roubles in the chest!’ In a fit of rage, she grabbed his hair and pulled him into the room. Marmeladov crawled on his knees to follow her. \n\n‘And this is a comfort to me! This doesn’t hurt me, but is a real comfort, honored sir,’ he said, being shaken by his hair and even hitting his forehead on the ground. The child sleeping on the floor woke up and started to cry.

He’s drunk it all,’ the poor woman cried in despair. ‘And his clothes are gone! And they are hungry, hungry!’ She wrung her hands and pointed to the children. ‘Oh, cursed life! And you, aren’t you ashamed?’ She suddenly turned on Raskolnikov. ‘You came from the tavern! Have you been drinking with him? You have been drinking with him too! Go away!’ \n\nThe young man quickly left without saying a word.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marmeladov's wife confronts him in a frenzy over his drunkenness and the missing money, revealing the family's desperate situation."
