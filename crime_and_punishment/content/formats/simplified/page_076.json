  "text": "Raskolnikov was upset and shouted about a man who was bothering a girl. He thought it was obvious what the man wanted and called him a brute for not leaving her alone.\n\nThe man heard Raskolnikov and looked angry but decided not to react and just gave him a nasty look. He walked away a bit but then stopped again.\n\nThe policeman thought they could help the girl if she would just say where she wanted to go. He called out to her again. \n\nSuddenly, she opened her eyes wide, looked at the policeman like she understood something, got up, and started to walk away in the direction she had come from. She complained about people not leaving her alone and waved her hand. She walked quickly but was still unsteady. The man followed her but took a different path, keeping an eye on her.\n\nThe policeman confidently said he wouldnâ€™t let the man have her and went after them. He sighed and complained about the bad things he saw in the world.\n\nAt that moment, Raskolnikov felt a sudden change in his feelings. He shouted after the policeman to let the girl be and let the man do what he wanted.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses disdain for a man pursuing a vulnerable girl, urging the policeman to let her be."
