  "text": "Luzhin is giving her money, but it's from a different man. Don't be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, just think about it calmly. \n\nSvidrigaïlov was very calm and cool while saying this. \n\n“Please stop talking,” Raskolnikov said. “This is really rude.” \n\n“Not at all. So, a person can only hurt others and can’t do any good because of silly rules? That’s crazy. If I died and left money to your sister in my will, she would surely take it.” \n\n“Very likely she wouldn’t.” \n\n“Oh, yes, she would. But if she refuses it, that’s fine. Ten thousand roubles is a lot of money to have when you need it. Please tell Avdotya Romanovna what I said.” \n\n“No, I won’t.” \n\n“In that case, I’ll have to try to see her myself and bother her.” \n\n“And if I do tell her, will you not try to see her?” \n\n“I really don’t know. I would like to see her again.” \n\n“Don’t count on it.” \n\n“I’m sorry. But you don’t really know me. Maybe we can be friends.” \n\n“You think we can be friends?” \n\n“Why not?” Svidrigaïlov said with a smile. He stood up and took his hat. “I didn’t mean to disturb you.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov suggests that Raskolnikov should inform his sister about a monetary gift he wishes to offer her, despite Raskolnikov's refusal to facilitate the communication."
