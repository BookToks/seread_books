  "text": "**Crime and Punishment**\n\nMany ordinary people, as I might have called them, like to think of themselves as advanced or special. They imagine they are part of a new movement and see themselves as \"destroyers.\" However, they often overlook or even look down on truly new people, who they see as old-fashioned. \n\nBut I don’t think this is a big problem, so you don’t need to worry. They usually don’t go too far with their ideas. Sometimes, they might get in trouble for getting carried away, but that's not really needed. They often punish themselves because they care about doing the right thing. Some help each other, while others do it alone. They create public acts of penance that look nice and meaningful, so there's really nothing to be concerned about. It’s just how things are.\n\n\"Well, you have made me feel better about that,\" someone said. \"But I'm still worried about something else. Are there many people who have the right to kill others, these special people? I could respect them, but it’s scary if there are a lot of them, right?\"\n\n\"Oh, you don’t need to worry about that either,\" Raskolnikov replied. \"People with new ideas or even just a little ability to think differently are very few.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Many ordinary people aspire to be part of a 'new movement' while often failing to recognize or appreciate the truly innovative individuals among them."
