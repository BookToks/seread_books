  "text": "A lot of noise was happening with a smart lady who was being treated badly. But soon, someone found it funny and wanted to laugh, even though he was very nervous. \n\n\"Ilya Petrovitch!\" the head clerk started to say worriedly but stopped because he knew the angry assistant wouldn’t listen unless someone forced him. \n\nThe smart lady was scared at first, but strangely, the more she was insulted, the nicer she seemed and the more she smiled at the angry assistant. She moved around a lot, bowing and waiting for a chance to speak, and finally, she got it.\n\n\"There was no noise or fighting in my house, Mr. Captain,\" she said quickly, speaking Russian with a strong German accent. \"And I’m telling the truth; it’s not my fault. My house is respectable, and I don’t like scandals. But he came in drunk and asked for three more bottles. Then he lifted one leg and started playing the piano with his foot, which is not right in a good house. He broke the piano, and that was very rude, and I told him so. Then he picked up a bottle and started hitting everyone with it. So, I called the porter, and Karl came.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The scene depicts a chaotic confrontation in an \"honourable house\" where a drunken man causes a scandal, amusing some while alarming others."
