I heard it myself...\"\n\n\"I've come to you for the last time,\" Raskolnikov said sadly, even though it was actually the first time. \"I might not see you again...\"\n\n\"Are you... going away?\"\n\n\"I don't know... tomorrow...\"\n\n\"Then you're not coming to Katerina Ivanovna tomorrow?\" Sonia's voice trembled.\n\n\"I don't know. I'll find out tomorrow morning... Never mind that: I've come to say one word...\"\n\nHe looked at her and realized he was sitting while she was still standing.\n\n\"Why are you standing? Sit down,\" he said in a softer, friendlier tone.\n\nShe sat down. He looked at her with kindness and almost pity.\n\n\"How thin you are! What a hand! It's so thin, like a dead hand.\"\n\nHe took her hand. Sonia smiled weakly.\n\n\"I have always been like this,\" she said.\n\n\"Even when you lived at home?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Of course you were,\" he said suddenly.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov visits Sonia for what he believes may be the last time, expressing concern for her well-being while contemplating his uncertain future."
