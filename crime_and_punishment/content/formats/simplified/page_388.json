He can eat later.” Razumihin agreed, and they both left the room quietly, closing the door.\n\nAfter about half an hour, Raskolnikov opened his eyes, lay on his back, and put his hands behind his head. \n\n“Who is that man? Where did he come from? What did he see? He knows everything, that’s clear. Where was he? How could he see it all? Is it even possible?” Raskolnikov thought, feeling cold and shivering. “And the jewelry box Nikolay found behind the door—was that real? A clue? If you miss one tiny detail, you can turn it into a huge case against you! Even a fly could have seen it! Is it possible?” He suddenly felt disgusted by how weak he had become. “I should have known,” he thought with a bitter smile. “How could I, knowing what I am, take an axe and kill someone? I should have known better… but I did know!” he whispered in despair. Sometimes, he paused to think deeply.\n\n“No, those men aren’t like that. The real Master, who thinks he can do anything, attacks Toulon, causes a massacre in Paris, forgets an army in Egypt, loses half a million men in the Moscow campaign, and just jokes about it in Vilna.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reflects on his weakness and the consequences of his actions, questioning the nature of guilt and the possibility of being above moral laws."
