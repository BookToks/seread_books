  "text": "Katerina Ivanovna quietly put thirty roubles on the table. She didn’t say anything or even look at Sonia. Instead, she took our big green shawl, covered her head and face, and lay down on the bed with her back to the wall. Only her small shoulders and body shook. I stayed lying there, just like before.\n\nThen I saw Katerina Ivanovna go to Sonia’s little bed in silence. She knelt down and kissed Sonia’s feet all evening without getting up. Eventually, they both fell asleep in each other’s arms.\n\nMarmeladov stopped talking, as if he couldn’t speak anymore. He quickly filled his glass, drank, and cleared his throat. \n\n“Since then,” he continued after a short pause, “because of a bad situation and some mean people telling lies—especially Darya Frantsovna, who said she was treated badly—my daughter Sofya Semyonovna had to take a yellow ticket. Because of this, she can’t live with us anymore. Our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna, wouldn’t allow it, even though she had supported Darya Frantsovna before. Mr. Lebeziatnikov also caused trouble between him and Katerina Ivanovna because of Sonia. At first, he wanted to be close to Sonia, but then he suddenly acted all high and mighty, saying, ‘How can a well-educated man like me live in the same rooms?’”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna and Sonia share a moment of intimacy and despair as they cope with their dire circumstances."
