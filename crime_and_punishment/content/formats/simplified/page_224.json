Strangely, he felt completely calm; there was no sign of the panic and fear he had felt before. This was the first moment of sudden calm. His movements were clear and purposeful. He kept muttering to himself, “Today, today.” He knew he was still weak, but his strong focus gave him some strength and confidence. He also hoped he wouldn’t collapse in the street. \n\nAfter putting on new clothes, he looked at the money on the table. After thinking for a moment, he put it in his pocket. It was twenty-five roubles. He also took all the small change from the ten roubles Razumihin had spent on the clothes. Then he quietly unlocked the door, went out, and went downstairs.
