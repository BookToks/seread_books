  "text": "Raskolnikov walked up to the police office. He heard a dog barking loudly downstairs and a woman yelling and throwing a rolling pin at it. He went outside into the yard and saw Sonia, who looked pale and scared. She stared at him with a look of deep pain and despair. She held her hands together. He forced a strange, meaningless smile, stood there for a moment, then went back to the police office.\n\nIlya Petrovitch was sitting at a table, looking through some papers. The same peasant who had pushed past him on the stairs was there too. \n\n“Hey! Back again? Did you forget something? What’s wrong?” \n\nRaskolnikov, with pale lips and wide eyes, walked slowly closer. He went to the table, put his hand on it, and tried to speak, but only made strange sounds. \n\n“You look sick. Here, sit down! Some water!” \n\nRaskolnikov sat in a chair but kept staring at Ilya Petrovitch, who looked surprised. They both waited and then someone brought water. \n\n“I…,” Raskolnikov started. \n\n“Drink some water.” \n\nRaskolnikov waved his hand to refuse the water and spoke softly but clearly, “I killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister Lizaveta with an axe and robbed them.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confesses to killing the old pawnbroker and her sister."
