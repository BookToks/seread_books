  "text": "\"Crime and Punishment\" \n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Razumihin. \"There’s an apartment here in this building that belongs to the same owner. It’s a separate flat, not connected to these other rooms. It’s furnished, the rent is reasonable, and it has three rooms. Why don’t you take it to start with? I’ll sell your watch tomorrow and get you the money, and we can sort everything out then. You can all live together, and Rodya will be with you. But where are you going, Rodya?\"\n\n\"What, Rodya, are you leaving already?\" Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked, surprised.\n\n\"At this time?\" Razumihin exclaimed.\n\nDounia looked at her brother in disbelief. He was holding his cap in his hand and getting ready to leave them.\n\n\"It’s like you’re burying me or saying goodbye forever,\" he said in a strange way. He tried to smile, but it didn't really work. \"But who knows, maybe this is the last time we’ll see each other...\" he accidentally said out loud. That was what he was thinking.\n\n\"What’s wrong with you?\" his mother shouted.\n\n\"Where are you going, Rodya?\" Dounia asked, sounding a bit odd.\n\n\"Oh, I really have to...\" he answered vaguely, as if unsure of what to say. But there was a strong look of determination on his pale face.\n\n\"I wanted to say... as I was coming here... I meant to tell you, mother, and you, Dounia, that it would be better for us to be apart for a while. I feel sick, I’m not at peace...\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Rodya expresses a desire to part from his family temporarily due to his feelings of illness and unrest."
