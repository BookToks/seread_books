  "text": "A man who looked like a worker was sitting in front of a pot of beer. He was drunk, but not too much. His friend was a big, heavy man with a gray beard, wearing a short coat. He was very drunk and had fallen asleep on the bench. Sometimes, he would wake up, crack his fingers, and move his arms around while humming a silly tune, trying to remember lines like these:\n\n‘His wife a year he fondly loved  \nHis wife a—a year he—  \nfondly loved.’\n\nThen he would suddenly wake up and say:\n\n‘Walking along the crowded row  \nHe met the one he used to know.’\n\nBut no one else enjoyed it. His quiet friend looked at him with distrust. There was another man in the room who seemed like a retired government worker. He was sitting alone, occasionally taking a sip from his drink and watching everyone around him. He also seemed a bit nervous.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov observes a drunken man in a tavern, highlighting the contrasting emotions and behaviors of the patrons around him."
