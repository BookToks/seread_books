  "text": "A man who seemed to be a worker was sitting in front of a beer pot. He was drunk, but not too much. Next to him was a big, heavy man with a grey beard, wearing a short coat. This man was very drunk and had fallen asleep on the bench. Sometimes, he would wake up and start moving his arms around, cracking his fingers, while humming a silly tune. He tried to remember some lines like:\n\n‘His wife he loved for a year, His wife a—a year he—loved.’\n\nThen he would suddenly wake up again and say:\n\n‘Walking along the crowded street, He met someone he used to know.’\n\nBut no one joined in with him. His quiet companion watched him with distrust. There was another man in the room who looked like he used to work for the government. He was sitting alone, sipping his drink and looking around at the others. He also seemed a bit anxious.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov observes a drunken man in a tavern, highlighting the contrasting reactions of the patrons to his antics."
