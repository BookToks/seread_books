  "text": "A man who looked like a worker was sitting in front of a pot of beer. He was drunk, but not too much. His friend was a big, heavy man with a grey beard, wearing a short coat. He was very drunk and had fallen asleep on the bench. Every now and then, he would wake up, stretch his arms, and move around on the bench while humming a silly tune, trying to remember lines like:\n\n‘His wife a year he fondly loved His wife a—a year he—fondly loved.’\n\nSometimes he would suddenly wake up and say:\n\n‘Walking along the crowded row He met the one he used to know.’\n\nBut no one joined in his fun. His quiet friend looked at him with distrust and dislike. There was another man in the room who seemed like a retired government worker. He was sitting alone, sipping from his drink, and watching everyone else. He also looked a bit nervous.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov observes a drunken man in a tavern, highlighting the contrasting emotions and social dynamics present in the scene."
