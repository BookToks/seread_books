  "text": "In the hot midday sun in Dagestan, she remembered a song she loved. \n\n“Polenka! Your father used to sing it when we were engaged. Oh, those days! We should sing it! How does it go? I’ve forgotten. Remind me!” \n\nShe was very excited and tried to sit up. With a weak, broken voice, she started to sing, gasping with every word and looking scared. \n\n“In the heat of midday! … in the vale! … of Dagestan! … With lead in my breast! …” \n\nSuddenly, she cried out, “Your excellency! Please protect the orphans! You were their father’s guest…” She seemed to wake up and looked around in fear but quickly recognized Sonia. \n\n“Sonia, Sonia!” she said softly, as if surprised to see her. “Sonia, darling, are you here, too?” \n\nThey helped her sit up again. \n\n“Enough! It’s over! Goodbye, poor thing! I can’t go on! I’m broken!” she cried in despair, and her head fell back on the pillow. \n\nShe lost consciousness again, but it didn’t last long. Her pale face dropped back, her mouth opened, her leg twitched, she sighed deeply, and then she died. \n\nSonia rushed to her, wrapped her arms around her, and stayed still with her head against the dead woman.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A dying woman expresses despair and relinquishes her children to Sonia, who mourns her loss."
