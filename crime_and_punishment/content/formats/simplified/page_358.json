I didn’t mean that!” Razumihin shouted, upset. \n\nRaskolnikov thought to himself, “Was that okay? Did I go too far? Why did I say that about women?” \n\n“Oh, your mother is with you?” Porfiry asked. \n\n“Yes.” \n\n“When did she arrive?” \n\n“Last night.” \n\nPorfiry paused as if he was thinking. \n\n“Your things wouldn’t be lost anyway,” he said calmly and coldly. “I’ve been expecting you here for a while.” \n\nAs if it didn’t matter, he offered the ashtray to Razumihin, who was carelessly dropping cigarette ash on the carpet. Raskolnikov felt uneasy, but Porfiry didn’t seem to notice him and was focused on Razumihin’s cigarette. \n\n“What? Expecting him? Did you know he had things there?” Razumihin exclaimed. \n\nPorfiry turned to Raskolnikov. \n\n“Your things, the ring and the watch, were wrapped together, and your name was clearly written on the paper, along with the date you left them.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels anxious and self-conscious during a conversation with Porfiry and Razumihin about a lost watch and his mother's presence."
