  "text": "I came here without planning to… but I was really struck by your face this morning. \n\n“Where did you see me this morning?” Raskolnikov asked, feeling uneasy. \n\n“I saw you by chance… I kept thinking there’s something about you that’s like me… But don’t worry. I’m not trying to bother you. I used to get along fine with card players, and I never annoyed Prince Svirbey, who is a distant relative of mine. I could write about Raphael’s Madonna in Madam Prilukov’s album, and I stayed by Marfa Petrovna’s side for seven years. I used to spend the night at Viazemsky’s house in the Hay Market back in the day, and maybe I’ll go up in a balloon with Berg.” \n\n“Oh, okay. Are you leaving soon for your travels, if I may ask?” \n\n“What travels?” \n\n“Your ‘journey’; you mentioned it yourself.” \n\n“A journey? Oh, yes. I did talk about a journey. Well, that’s a big topic… if only you knew what you’re asking,” he said, then suddenly laughed loudly for a moment. “Maybe I’ll get married instead of going on the journey. They’re trying to set me up.” \n\n“Here?” \n\n“Yes.” \n\n“How did you have time for that?” \n\n“But I really want to see Avdotya Romanovna just once. I really ask you. Well, goodbye for now. Oh, yes. I almost forgot something. Tell your sister, Rodion Romanovitch, that Marfa Petrovna remembered her in her will.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov informs Raskolnikov that Marfa Petrovna left money for Avdotya Romanovna in her will."
