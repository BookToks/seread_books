Just the other day, I read in the Moscow News that a whole group of people making fake money got caught in Moscow. They were like a little club. They used to make fake tickets!\"\n\nRaskolnikov replied calmly, \"Oh, that was a long time ago! I read about it a month back. So you think they are criminals?\" He smiled.\n\n\"Of course they are criminals,\" Zametov answered.\n\nRaskolnikov said, \"They? They are just kids, simpletons, not real criminals! I mean, a bunch of people getting together to do that—what a silly idea! Even three people is too many, and they trust each other more than themselves! One person just has to get drunk and talk, and it all falls apart. Simpletons! They hired untrustworthy people to change the money—what a stupid thing to trust a stranger with! \n\n\"Let’s say these simpletons do succeed and each makes a million. What happens then for the rest of their lives? They depend on each other forever! They might as well just hang themselves! Plus, they didn’t even know how to change the money right. The guy who changed the money took five thousand roubles, but his hands were shaking. He counted the first four thousand but didn’t count the last one—he was too eager to get the cash and run away. Of course, that made people suspicious. And everything fell apart because of one fool! Is that really possible?\"\n\nZametov replied, \"That his hands were shaking? Yeah, that’s definitely possible. Sometimes people just can’t handle things.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov dismisses a recent gang of false coiners as simpletons rather than true criminals, highlighting the fragility of their scheme and the risks of dependence on others."
