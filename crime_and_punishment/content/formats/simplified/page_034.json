The bar, his messy appearance, the nights spent in a hay barge, and the bottle of alcohol showed how far he had fallen, yet he still loved his wife and kids deeply. Raskolnikov listened carefully but felt sick. He was annoyed that he had come here.\n\n“Honored sir, honored sir,” Marmeladov said, getting himself together. “Maybe all this seems funny to you, like it does to others, and maybe I’m just bothering you with the boring details of my life, but it’s not funny to me. I feel it all... I spent that wonderful day dreaming about how I would fix everything, how I would dress my kids, how I would give her a break, and how I would save my daughter from shame and bring her back home... and much more. It’s understandable, sir. Well, sir,” (Marmeladov suddenly looked up and stared at Raskolnikov) “the very next day after all those dreams, five days ago, I secretly took the key to Katerina Ivanovna’s box, took out what was left of my pay, I don’t remember how much it was, and now look at me! It’s been five days since I left home, they are looking for me, I lost my job, and my uniform is at a bar on the Egyptian bridge. I traded it for the clothes I’m wearing now... and it’s the end.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marmeladov expresses his deep love for his family despite his degradation and despair, revealing his struggles with addiction and the consequences of his actions."
