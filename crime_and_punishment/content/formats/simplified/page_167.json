You’re going to drive me mad too… why did you come to see me, damn it?’\n\n‘I don’t want… translation,’ Raskolnikov muttered from the stairs.\n\n‘Then what do you want?’ shouted Razumihin from above. Raskolnikov kept going down the stairs in silence.\n\n‘Hey! Where are you living?’\n\nNo answer.\n\n‘Well, forget you then!’\n\nBut Raskolnikov was already stepping out onto the street. On the Nikolaevsky Bridge, he suddenly became fully aware again after an unpleasant event. A coachman, after shouting at him a few times, hit him hard on the back with his whip for almost stepping under the horses’ hooves. The hit made him so angry that he rushed to the railing (for some reason, he had been walking right in the middle of the bridge with all the traffic). He clenched his fists and gritted his teeth. He heard laughter, of course.\n\n‘He got what he deserved!’\n\n‘A pickpocket, I bet.’\n\n‘Pretending to be drunk on purpose and getting in the way; and now we have to deal with him.’\n\n‘It’s like a job for him, that’s what it is.’\n\nAs he stood at the railing, still looking angry and confused after the carriage that had just left, he rubbed his back.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, in a state of confusion and anger, faces the disdain of passersby after a coachman lashes him for nearly stepping into traffic."
