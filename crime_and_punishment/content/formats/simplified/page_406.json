  "text": "‘No!’  \n‘I thought I did. When I came in and saw you lying with your eyes shut, pretending, I said to myself right away, ‘Here’s the man.’’  \n‘What do you mean by ‘the man?’ What are you talking about?’ Raskolnikov shouted.  \n‘What do I mean? I really don’t know….’ Svidrigaïlov said, sounding confused too.  \n\nThey were silent for a minute, staring at each other.  \n‘That’s all nonsense!’ Raskolnikov yelled, feeling annoyed. ‘What does she say when she comes to you?’  \n‘She! You wouldn’t believe it, she talks about the silliest things, and—people are strange—it makes me angry. The first time she came in (I was tired, you know: the funeral service, the ceremony, the lunch after. Finally, I was alone in my study. I lit a cigar and started to think), she walked in and said, ‘You’ve been so busy today, Arkady Ivanovitch, you forgot to wind the dining-room clock.’ I wound that clock every week for seven years, and if I forgot, she would always remind me. The next day, I left for here. I got off at the station at dawn; I was tired and half-asleep, drinking some coffee. I looked up and suddenly saw Marfa Petrovna sitting next to me with a pack of cards. ‘Shall I tell your fortune for the journey, Arkady Ivanovitch?’ She was really good at telling fortunes. I’ll never forgive myself for not asking her to. I ran away in a panic, and besides, the bell rang.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov describes his encounters with the ghost of his deceased wife, Marfa Petrovna, who engages him in trivial conversations."
