He died in her arms. \n\n“He got what he wanted,” Katerina Ivanovna cried when she saw her husband’s dead body. “What do I do now? How am I supposed to bury him? What can I give them to eat tomorrow?”\n\nRaskolnikov walked over to Katerina Ivanovna. “Katerina Ivanovna,” he said, “last week your husband told me about his life. He spoke about you with great respect. From that evening, when I learned how much he loved and respected you, especially you, Katerina Ivanovna, even with his problems, we became friends. Let me do something to help you in memory of my dead friend. Here are twenty roubles. If this can help you, then I will come back. I promise to come again, maybe tomorrow. Goodbye!”\n\nHe quickly left the room, pushing through the crowd to the stairs. But in the crowd, he bumped into Nikodim Fomitch, who had come to give instructions after hearing about the accident. They hadn’t seen each other since the police station, but Nikodim Fomitch recognized him right away. \n\n“Oh, it’s you?” he asked. \n\n“He’s dead,” Raskolnikov replied. “The doctor and the priest have been here, everything is as it should be. Don’t stress the poor woman too much; she is already sick. Try to cheer her up if you can… you’re a kind man.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov offers financial assistance to Katerina Ivanovna after her husband's death, expressing his respect for the deceased."
