You were the one who kept hanging around me.”\n\n“Just because you’re an interesting person to watch. I liked how unusual your situation is! Also, you are the brother of someone I find very interesting. I’ve heard a lot about you from that person, and it seems like you have a big influence over her. Isn’t that enough? Ha-ha-ha! But I have to admit, your question is kind of complicated and hard for me to answer. You came to me not just for a specific reason, but also to hear something new, right? Isn’t that true?” Svidrigaïlov said with a sly smile. “Well, can’t you imagine that I was also thinking about you on my way here, hoping you’d tell me something new and that I could get something out of it? Look at how rich we are!”\n\n“What could you get out of it?”\n\n“How should I know? I spend all my time in this tavern, and it’s my way of having fun. Well, it’s not really fun, but I have to sit somewhere. That poor Katia—you saw her? If only I were a big eater, a fancy food lover, but I can only eat this.” \n\nHe pointed to a small table in the corner with leftover beef steak and potatoes on a tin dish.\n\n“By the way, have you eaten? I’ve had something and I don’t want more. I don’t drink anything, except for champagne. I never touch anything else.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov expresses his interest in Raskolnikov as a subject of observation due to his connection to a person of interest and the complexity of their interaction."
