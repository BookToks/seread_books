  "text": "Dostoevsky had epilepsy, which he dealt with for the rest of his life. He had seizures three or four times a year, especially during stressful times. In 1859, he was allowed to go back to Russia. He started a journal called ‘Vremya,’ but it was banned because of a mistake. \n\nIn 1864, he lost his first wife and his brother Mihail. He was very poor, but he took on his brother’s debts. He started another journal called ‘The Epoch,’ but it was also banned within a few months. He was overwhelmed by debt, his brother’s family relied on him, and he had to write very quickly, never taking the time to fix his work. The last years of his life were made better by the love and support of his second wife.\n\nIn June 1880, he gave a famous speech at the unveiling of a monument to Pushkin in Moscow, where he was warmly celebrated. A few months later, Dostoevsky died. Many people came to his funeral, giving him a send-off fit for a king. He is still one of the most read writers in Russia.\n\nA Russian critic described Dostoevsky as someone who felt like family to us, a person who suffered and understood life more deeply than most. His deep understanding is seen as wisdom, which we look to in order to learn how to live. While he had many natural talents, this wisdom was something he earned through his experiences.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dostoevsky faced immense personal and financial struggles throughout his life, yet his profound insights and literary contributions earned him enduring admiration in Russia."
