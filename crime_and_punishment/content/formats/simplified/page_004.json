  "text": "Dostoevsky had epilepsy, which he dealt with for the rest of his life. He would have seizures three or four times a year, especially during stressful times. In 1859, he was allowed to go back to Russia. He started a journal called 'Vremya,' but it was banned because of a misunderstanding. \n\nIn 1864, he lost his first wife and his brother Mihail. He was very poor, but he took on his brother's debts. He then started another journal called 'The Epoch,' which was also banned after a few months. He was overwhelmed by debt, and his brother's family relied on him. He had to write very quickly and reportedly never edited his work. The later years of his life were made better by the love and support of his second wife.\n\nIn June 1880, he gave a famous speech at the unveiling of a monument to Pushkin in Moscow, where he was welcomed with great love and respect. A few months later, Dostoevsky died. Many people attended his funeral, giving him a royal send-off. He is still one of the most read writers in Russia.\n\nA Russian critic described Dostoevsky as someone who felt like part of the people, a man who suffered and understood life deeply. His insights feel like wisdom to us, teaching us how to live. While he had many natural talents, this deep understanding was something he gained through his own experiences.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dostoevsky faced personal tragedies and poverty throughout his life, yet his profound insights and literary contributions earned him enduring admiration in Russia."
