  "text": "By the way, Potchinkov’s house is just a short walk away. I really should go see Razumihin, even if it wasn’t so close. Let him win his bet! He deserves some happiness, too—no matter what! What you need is strength; you can’t get anything without it, and you have to earn strength with strength. That’s what they don’t understand, he thought proudly as he walked slowly away from the bridge. His pride and confidence were growing stronger; he felt like he was becoming a different person every moment. He didn’t know what had caused this change in him. Like someone grabbing for something to hold onto, he suddenly felt that he could live, that there was still a life for him, that his life hadn’t ended with the old woman. Maybe he was rushing to conclusions, but he didn’t think about that.\n\n\"But I did ask her to remember ‘Thy servant Rodion’ in her prayers,\" he suddenly thought. \"Well, that was just in case something happened,\" he added and laughed at his silly thought. He was feeling very happy.\n\nHe easily found Razumihin; the new lodger was already known at Potchinkov’s, and the porter quickly showed him the way. Halfway up the stairs, he could hear a lot of noise and lively conversation from a big group of people. The door was wide open, and he could hear the chatter and excitement. Razumihin’s room was quite large, and there were about fifteen people there. Raskolnikov paused at the entrance, where two of the landlady’s servants were busy behind a screen with two samovars, bottles, plates, and dishes of pie and snacks brought up from the landlady’s kitchen.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels a surge of pride and self-confidence as he contemplates his life and the possibility of change."
