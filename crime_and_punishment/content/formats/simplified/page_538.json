And those awful Poles, ha-ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.) None of them have ever been here before; I've never seen them. What are they doing here? They’re just sitting there. Hey, you! she suddenly shouted at one of them, have you tried the pancakes? Take some more! Have some beer! Want some vodka? Look, he jumped up and is bowing; they must be starving, poor things. Never mind, let them eat! They’re quiet, anyway, but I really worry about our landlady’s silver spoons… Amalia Ivanovna! she suddenly called out, loud enough for everyone to hear, if your spoons get stolen, I won’t take the blame, I warn you! Ha-ha-ha! \n\nShe laughed and turned to Raskolnikov, enjoying her joke. “She didn’t get it, she didn’t understand again! Look how she sits there with her mouth open! Like an owl, a real owl! An owl in new ribbons, ha-ha-ha!” \n\nThen her laugh turned into a terrible coughing fit that lasted five minutes. Sweat appeared on her forehead, and her handkerchief was stained with blood.
