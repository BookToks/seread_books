But a storm would help clear the air,” he said as he put on his cap.\n\n“Porfiry Petrovitch, don’t think that I confessed anything to you today,” Raskolnikov said firmly. “You’re a strange man, and I listened to you out of curiosity. But I haven’t admitted anything, remember that!”\n\n“Oh, I know that, I’ll remember. Look at you, you’re shaking! Don’t worry, my friend, do what you want. Just walk around a bit, but you won’t be able to walk too far. If anything happens, I have one request,” he said quietly. “It’s a bit awkward, but important. If something were to happen—though I really don’t believe it and think you wouldn’t do it—if you ever thought about ending things in some crazy way, like hurting yourself, just leave a short note, just two lines, and mention the stone. It would be kinder. Alright, see you later! I hope you have good thoughts and make good choices!”\n\nPorfiry left, bending down and avoiding looking at Raskolnikov. Raskolnikov went to the window and waited.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov insists he has not confessed to Porfiry, despite the latter's probing and concern for his well-being."
