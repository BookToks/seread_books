  "text": "They stepped out onto the street. \n\n“Dounia, I had a dream this morning about Marfa Petrovna. She was dressed in white and came up to me, took my hand, and shook her head at me like she was scolding me. Is that a good sign? Oh no! You don’t know, Dmitri Prokofitch, that Marfa Petrovna has died!”\n\n“No, I didn’t know. Who is Marfa Petrovna?”\n\n“She died suddenly, and just imagine…”\n\n“Let’s talk about it later, Mama,” Dounia interrupted. “He doesn’t know who Marfa Petrovna is.”\n\n“Oh, you don’t know? I thought you knew everything about us. I’m sorry, Dmitri Prokofitch. I haven’t been thinking straight these past few days. I see you as someone who helps us, so I assumed you knew all about us. I think of you like family. Please don’t be mad at me for saying that. By the way, what happened to your right hand? Did you hurt it?”\n\n“Yes, I bruised it,” Razumihin said, feeling happy.\n\n“I sometimes talk too much from the heart, and Dounia gets annoyed with me. But, oh my, what a small place he lives in! I wonder if he’s awake. Does his landlady really think this is a room? You say he doesn’t like to show his feelings, so I might bother him with my… weaknesses? Please tell me, Dmitri Prokofitch, how should I treat him? I feel so confused.”\n\n“Don’t ask him too many questions if he looks upset, and don’t ask about his health; he doesn’t like that.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia expresses concern about how to interact with her brother, Raskolnikov, while discussing their family situation and the recent death of Marfa Petrovna."
