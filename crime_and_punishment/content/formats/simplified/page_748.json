  "text": "Raskolnikov was in university when he helped a sick fellow student. He spent all his money to support him for six months. After the student died, Raskolnikov took care of the old father, who he had helped since he was thirteen. He got the old man into a hospital and paid for his funeral when he died.\n\nRaskolnikov’s landlady also testified that he saved two little kids from a fire in another house and got burned while doing it. Many witnesses confirmed this. These good deeds helped his case.\n\nIn the end, he was sentenced to eight years of hard labor because of the circumstances around his crime. \n\nAt the start of the trial, Raskolnikov’s mother got sick. Dounia and Razumihin managed to take her out of Petersburg during the trial. Razumihin picked a town nearby so he could keep track of the trial and see Dounia often. Raskolnikov’s mother had a strange illness that affected her mind.\n\nWhen Dounia came back from visiting her brother, she found her mother sick and confused. That night, Razumihin and Dounia planned how to answer her mother’s questions about Raskolnikov. They made up a story that he had to go far away in Russia.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's past acts of kindness and extenuating circumstances lead to a lighter sentence of eight years in penal servitude despite his crimes."
