  "text": "I want to clear things up with you, Rodion Romanovitch. I owe you an explanation and I need to give it to you. \n\nLast time we met, things were strange. I noticed a sad look on your face, which surprised me because I had never seen that from you before. \n\nI know I caused you a lot of pain. I’m not a bad person. I understand how hard it is for someone proud and impatient to deal with tough situations. I see you as a good person, even if we don’t always agree. \n\nI know you thought I had planned things, but that’s not true. I didn’t call anyone or make any plans. It all happened so fast. I had just called the porters, and then an idea hit me. I thought that even if I missed one chance, I would find another. I believed I wouldn’t lose what I wanted. \n\nYou are very sensitive, Rodion. I can see that, even if it’s mixed with other traits. I knew that sometimes people don’t just share their whole story right away. It can happen if you push them enough, but it’s rare. I thought if I had even a small fact to work with, I could get something real from you. If someone is guilty, you can usually find something solid to use against them. I was counting on your personality, Rodion. I had high hopes for you back then. \n\nBut what are you trying to say? Raskolnikov asked without thinking. He wondered if the other person really believed he was innocent. \n\nI’m here to explain myself, I said.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The speaker seeks to clarify a misunderstanding with Raskolnikov, expressing awareness of his suffering and acknowledging his noble character despite their previous interactions."
