  "text": "Sonia listened to Raskolnikov’s request with doubt and moved slowly to the table. She picked up the book.\n\n“Have you read it?” she asked, looking at him across the table. \n\nHer voice got more serious. \n\n“Long ago... When I was in school. Read!” \n\n“And haven’t you heard it in church?” \n\n“I... haven’t been. Do you go often?” \n\n“N-no,” Sonia whispered. \n\nRaskolnikov smiled. \n\n“I understand... And you won’t go to your father’s funeral tomorrow?” \n\n“Yes, I will.” \n\nSonia whispered softly, almost breathless, “What for? You don’t believe?” \n\n“Read! I want you to,” he insisted. “You used to read to Lizaveta.” \n\nSonia opened the book and found the right spot. Her hands were shaking, and she couldn’t speak. She tried to start twice but couldn’t say the first word. \n\n“Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany…” she finally managed to read, but her voice broke on the third word. She struggled to breathe. \n\nRaskolnikov understood why Sonia was having such a hard time reading to him. The more he saw this, the more he pushed her to do it. He knew it was hard for her to share her feelings. He realized these feelings were her secret treasure, kept for years while living with a sad father and a troubled stepmother, surrounded by hungry kids and harsh words. \n\nBut he also knew that even though it scared her and caused her pain, she really wanted to read to him. He could see this desire in her eyes and in her strong emotions. She took a deep breath, controlled her feelings, and continued reading the eleventh chapter of St. John. She went on to the nineteenth verse.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia struggles to read aloud to Raskolnikov, revealing her deep emotional turmoil and desire to share her thoughts despite the pain it brings her."
