  "text": "Rodya felt a mix of emotions when he saw his writing published for the first time. He was only twenty-three, and it made him feel upset. After reading it, he threw the paper down in anger and disgust, remembering all the struggles he had gone through in the past months.\n\nHis mother, Pulcheria, told him that despite his doubts, she believed he would soon be one of the top thinkers in Russia. She was shocked that some people thought he was crazy, and even Dounia almost believed it. She mentioned how their father had tried to get his poems and a novel published, but they were rejected. Pulcheria had worried about Rodya's life and how he was doing, but now she felt foolish for worrying because she believed he could achieve great things with his talent.\n\nRodya asked if Dounia was home, and his mother replied that she often wasn’t around and left her alone. Dmitri Prokofitch visited her and always spoke highly of Rodya, showing that he cared about him. Pulcheria said she wasn’t complaining about Dounia; she just had her own way of doing things.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's mother expresses her belief in his potential for greatness despite her worries about his current struggles."
