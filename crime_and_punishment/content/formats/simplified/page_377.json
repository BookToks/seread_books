  "text": "Raskolnikov didn’t say anything but stared hard at Porfiry. Razumihin looked unhappy and seemed to notice something. He looked around angrily. There was a moment of silence. Raskolnikov turned to leave.\n\n“Are you leaving already?” Porfiry said nicely, reaching out his hand politely. “I’m very glad to meet you. Don’t worry about your request; just write as I told you. Or better yet, come see me in a day or two… tomorrow, actually. I’ll definitely be there at eleven o’clock. We can sort everything out and have a talk. Since you’re one of the last to be here, you might be able to tell us something,” he added with a friendly smile.\n\n“Do you want to officially question me?” Raskolnikov asked sharply.\n\n“Oh, no, that’s not needed right now. You misunderstand me. I take every chance I get, and I’ve talked to everyone who had connections. I got information from some of them, and you’re the last one. By the way,” he said, suddenly excited, “what was I thinking?” He turned to Razumihin. “You were going on about that Nikolay… I know, I know very well he’s innocent, but what can we do? We had to bother Dmitri too. The main point is, when you went up the stairs, it was after seven, right?”\n\n“Yes,” Raskolnikov answered, feeling uneasy.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov engages in a tense conversation with Porfiry, who hints at his suspicions while maintaining a facade of politeness."
