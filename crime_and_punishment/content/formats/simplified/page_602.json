  "text": "Katerina Ivanovna was upset and pointed to the crying kids. Raskolnikov tried to convince her to go home. He even said it looked bad for her to be out in the streets like a street performer when she wanted to run a boarding school.\n\n“A boarding school? Ha! That’s just a silly dream,” Katerina Ivanovna laughed, but then she coughed. “No, Rodion, that dream is gone! Everyone has left us! … And that general… you know, I threw an inkpot at him! It was just sitting there in the waiting room. I signed my name, threw it at him, and ran away. Oh, they are such scoundrels! But I will take care of the kids myself; I won’t bow to anyone! Sonia has suffered enough for us!” she said, pointing to Sonia. “Polenka, how much money do you have? Show me! What? Only two farthings? Oh, those mean people! They give us nothing and just laugh at us. Look at that fool laughing!” (She pointed to a man in the crowd.) “It’s all because Kolya is so silly; he makes things hard for me. What do you want, Polenka? Tell me in French. I’ve taught you some phrases. You need to show that you are well-brought-up kids, not like other street performers. We aren’t going to have a Punch and Judy show.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna expresses her despair over their situation while insisting on providing for her children despite the challenges they face."
