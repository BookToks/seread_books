  "text": "A heavy horse-drawn cart passed by, and the driver shouted at him, “Hey there, German hatter!” The young man stopped suddenly and nervously grabbed his hat. It was a tall, round hat from a shop called Zimmerman’s, but it was old, worn out, and in bad shape. Instead of feeling ashamed, he felt a kind of fear.\n\n“I knew it,” he mumbled, confused. “I thought so! This is the worst! A silly thing like this could ruin my whole plan. My hat stands out too much. It looks ridiculous, and that makes it noticeable. With my old clothes, I should wear a cap or any old hat, but not this silly one. No one wears a hat like this; it would be remembered. That’s the problem—people would remember it, and that would give them a clue. For what I’m planning, I need to be as unnoticed as possible. Little things matter! It’s the small details that always ruin everything…”\n\nHe didn’t have far to go; he knew exactly how many steps it was from the gate of his lodging house: seven hundred and thirty. He had counted them once while daydreaming. At that time, he didn’t believe in those dreams and thought they were just wild ideas. Now, a month later, he started to see those dreams differently. Even though he often mocked himself for being weak and unsure, he couldn’t help but see this “crazy” dream as something to try, even if he still hesitated.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The young man is consumed by anxiety over his conspicuous hat, fearing it could jeopardize his carefully planned actions."
