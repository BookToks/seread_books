  "text": "A heavy horse-drawn cart passed by, and the driver shouted at him, “Hey there, German hatter!” The young man suddenly stopped and nervously grabbed his hat. It was a tall, round hat from Zimmerman’s, but it was old, rusty, torn, and bent on one side. Instead of feeling embarrassed, he felt a kind of fear.\n\n“I knew it,” he muttered, feeling confused. “I thought so! This is the worst! A silly detail like this could ruin my whole plan. Yes, my hat is too noticeable. It looks ridiculous, and that makes it stand out. With my old clothes, I should wear a cap or anything else, but not this silly hat. No one wears a hat like this; it would be remembered. What matters is that people would notice it, and that could give them a clue. For what I’m planning, I need to blend in as much as possible. Little things matter! It’s those little things that always mess everything up.”\n\nHe didn’t have far to go; he knew exactly how many steps it was from the gate of his boarding house: seven hundred and thirty. He had counted them once when he was daydreaming. Back then, he didn’t believe in those dreams and thought they were just silly. Now, a month later, he started to see them differently. Despite making fun of his own weakness and uncertainty, he couldn’t help but see this “terrible” dream as something he might actually try.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The young man is consumed by anxiety over his conspicuous hat, fearing it could jeopardize his carefully planned actions."
