  "text": "In the tavern, someone told a man that Katerina Ivanovna, his wife, had danced the shawl dance for the governor and other important people when she finished school. This certificate was meant to show that Katerina Ivanovna could open a boarding school. But she mainly wanted to use it to impress \"those two stuck-up girls\" if they came to dinner. She wanted to prove that she came from a noble family, as the daughter of a colonel, and was better than some recent women who were trying to get attention.\n\nThe certificate quickly got passed around to the drunken guests, and Katerina Ivanovna didn’t try to get it back. It stated that her father was a major and had a special honor, so she really was almost the daughter of a colonel.\n\nGetting excited, Katerina Ivanovna talked about the happy life they would have in T——. She mentioned the gym teachers she would hire for her boarding school, including a respectable old Frenchman named Mangot, who had taught her in the past and still lived in T——. She thought he would teach at her school for a reasonable price. Then she talked about Sonia, who would come with her to T—— and help with her plans. At that moment, someone at the other end of the table suddenly laughed loudly. \n\nEven though Katerina Ivanovna tried to act like she didn’t notice, she raised her voice and continued speaking.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna boasts about her noble background and plans to open a boarding school, hoping to impress her guests."
