What are you doing here?” he shouted, clenching his fists and laughing with rage.\n\n“What do you mean?” the man asked, looking annoyed and surprised.\n\n“Get away, that’s what I mean.”\n\n“How dare you, you lowlife!” The man raised his cane. Raskolnikov ran at him with his fists, not thinking that the fat man was stronger than him. But just then, someone grabbed him from behind, and a police officer stepped between them.\n\n“That’s enough, gentlemen. No fighting in public. What do you want? Who are you?” the officer asked Raskolnikov, looking at his worn clothes.\n\nRaskolnikov stared at him. The officer had a serious, sensible face with gray mustaches.\n\n“You are just the person I need,” Raskolnikov said, grabbing his arm. “I’m a student, Raskolnikov… You should know that too,” he added, looking at the fat man. “Come on, I have something to show you.” \n\nHe took the policeman's hand and led him to the seat. \n\n“Look here, she’s totally drunk, and she just came down the street. We don’t know who she is or what’s happened to her.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confronts a gentleman in anger while trying to protect a drunken girl he believes has been mistreated."
