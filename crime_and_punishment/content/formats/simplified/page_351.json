  "text": "I was at the old woman's place yesterday and asked about the blood. I need to find out right away when I go in. I need to see it on his face; otherwise, I’ll find out if it ruins me. \n\n\"Hey, brother,\" he suddenly said to Razumihin with a sly smile, \"I've noticed you seem really excited today. Am I right?\" \n\n\"Excited? Not at all,\" Razumihin replied, clearly annoyed. \n\n\"Yes, brother, I promise it shows. You sat in your chair differently than usual, kind of on the edge, and you looked like you were squirming the whole time. You kept getting up for no reason. One minute you were angry, and the next you looked all sweet. You even blushed, especially when you were invited to dinner; you turned really red.\" \n\n\"That's not true, what are you talking about?\" \n\n\"Why are you acting like a shy schoolboy? Look, you're blushing again.\" \n\n\"You're such a pig!\" \n\n\"Why are you so embarrassed? Romeo! Just wait, I’ll tell everyone today. Ha-ha-ha! I’ll make mom laugh, and someone else too…\" \n\n\"Listen, this is serious... What are you going to tell them? Come on, brother… you’re such a pig!\" \n\n\"You’re like a summer rose. If only you knew how good it looks on you; a Romeo over six feet tall! And look at you today—you even cleaned your nails!\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov observes Razumihin's unusual excitement and playfully teases him about it."
