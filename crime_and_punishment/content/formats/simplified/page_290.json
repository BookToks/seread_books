  "text": "At last, we are on the right track, while Pyotr Petrovitch is not. I’ve called them names, but I do respect them all. I don’t respect Zametov, but I like him because he’s like a puppy. I respect Zossimov because he is honest and knows his job. But enough of that; it’s all said and forgiven. Is it forgiven? Well, let’s move on. \n\nI know this hallway; I’ve been here before. There was a scandal at Number 3. Where are you? What number? Eight? Lock yourselves in for the night. Don’t let anyone in. I’ll be back in fifteen minutes with news, and in half an hour, I’ll bring Zossimov. You’ll see! Goodbye, I’m off!\n\n“Good heavens, Dounia, what will happen?” said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, worried and upset.\n\n“Don’t worry, mother,” said Dounia, taking off her hat and cape. “God has sent this man to help us, even if he came from a party. We can trust him, I promise. And look at all he has done for Rodya…”\n\n“Oh, Dounia, I don’t know if he will come! How could I leave Rodya? I imagined our meeting so differently! He seemed so unhappy, like he didn’t want to see us…” Tears filled her eyes.\n\n“No, it’s not that, mother. You didn’t see; you were crying the whole time. He is very upset because he is seriously ill—that’s why.” \n\n“Oh, that illness! What will happen? What will happen?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia reassures her mother that a gentleman from a drinking party will help them, despite their worries about Rodya's condition."
