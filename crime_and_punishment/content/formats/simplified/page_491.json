  "text": "Did you ring the bell? Why did you ask about blood? And why did you invite the porters to go with you to the police station? That's how I should have acted if I had any suspicion of you. I should have taken your statement properly, searched your place, and maybe arrested you too. But I have no suspicion of you since I didn't do that! You can't see it clearly, and you don't understand, I say again.\n\nRaskolnikov jumped, so Porfiry noticed it right away. \n\n\"You’re lying all the time,\" he shouted. \"I don’t know what you want, but you are lying. You didn’t talk like that just now, and I can't be wrong!\"\n\n\"I’m lying?\" Porfiry repeated, sounding a bit angry but still smiling and acting like he didn’t care about what Raskolnikov thought. \"I’m lying... But how did I treat you just now, as the examining lawyer? I was helping you and giving you ways to defend yourself; I mentioned illness, delirium, injury, sadness, and the police officers. Ah! But those ways to defend yourself aren’t very strong and can go both ways: illness, delirium, I don’t remember—that’s fine, but why, my good sir, in your illness and delirium, were you troubled by just those thoughts and not any others? There could have been other thoughts, right? He-he-he!\"\n\nRaskolnikov looked at him with anger and disgust. \n\n\"To sum it up,\" he said loudly and firmly, standing up.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry asserts that he has no suspicion of Raskolnikov, despite Raskolnikov's anxious behavior and accusations of deceit."
