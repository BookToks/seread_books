  "text": "Andrey Semyonovitch was not very smart. He supported new ideas and the younger generation because he was excited about them. He was part of a large group of people who were not very bright, who liked to follow popular ideas but ended up making them less meaningful. \n\nEven though Lebeziatnikov was friendly, he started to dislike Pyotr Petrovitch. This feeling grew on both sides without them realizing it. Andrey Semyonovitch, despite being simple, began to notice that Pyotr Petrovitch was tricking him and looked down on him, thinking he wasn't a good person. He had tried to explain ideas from Fourier and Darwin to Pyotr Petrovitch, but lately, Pyotr Petrovitch listened in a rude way and seemed sarcastic. \n\nPyotr Petrovitch started to suspect that Lebeziatnikov was not just a simpleton, but maybe also a liar. He thought Lebeziatnikov didn't have any real connections and was just repeating things he heard from others. He probably didnâ€™t even understand his own ideas very well because he was confused. Pyotr Petrovitch had also been accepting strange compliments from Andrey Semyonovitch for the past ten days without arguing, like when Andrey praised him for wanting to help create a new community or not naming his children.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pyotr Petrovitch is depicted as a duplicitous character who secretly despises Andrey Semyonovitch while feigning interest in progressive ideas."
