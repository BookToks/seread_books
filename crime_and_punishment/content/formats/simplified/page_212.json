  "text": "Meanwhile, Raskolnikov, who had turned a bit towards him when he answered, suddenly started staring at him again with clear curiosity. It was like he hadn’t really looked at him before or something new caught his attention. He sat up on his pillow to get a better look.\n\nThere was definitely something unusual about Pyotr Petrovitch’s whole look, which made the title of ‘fiancé’ seem fitting for him. First, it was obvious that Pyotr Petrovitch had used his few days in the city to dress up and prepare for his future wife. This was perfectly normal and understandable. Even if he felt a little too pleased with how he looked, it could be excused since he was acting like a fiancé.\n\nAll his clothes were brand new from the tailor and looked nice, but they were also too new and obviously meant for this occasion. His stylish new round hat showed the same thing; he treated it with too much care, holding it carefully in his hands. The fancy lavender gloves, real Louvain, told the same story since he wasn’t wearing them but carrying them to show off.\n\nHis outfit had light and youthful colors. He wore a lovely summer jacket in a light brown shade, thin light trousers, a matching waistcoat, a cravat made of very light fabric with pink stripes, and the best part was that it all suited him well. His fresh and even handsome face looked younger than his actual age.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov observes Pyotr Petrovitch's overly polished appearance, which reflects his eagerness to impress as a fiancé."
