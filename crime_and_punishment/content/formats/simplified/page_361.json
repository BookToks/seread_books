My throat is dry,” Razumihin said.  \n“Great idea! Maybe we’ll all keep you company. Would you like something more before tea?”  \n“Stop it!”  \nPorfiry Petrovitch went out to get tea.  \nRaskolnikov's mind was racing. He was really angry.  \n“The worst part is they don’t hide it; they don’t care about being polite! If you didn’t know me, why did you talk to Nikodim Fomitch about me? They don’t even try to hide that they’re following me like dogs. It’s like they’re spitting in my face.” He was shaking with anger. “Come on, just attack me openly! Don’t play with me like a cat with a mouse. It’s rude, Porfiry Petrovitch, but maybe I won’t let it happen! I might just stand up and tell you all the truth, and you’ll see how much I despise you.” He could hardly breathe. “What if it’s just my imagination? What if I’m wrong and I get angry for no reason? Maybe it’s all unintentional. Their words sound normal, but there’s something off about them… Why did he say ‘With her’ so directly? Why did Zametov say I spoke cleverly? Why do they talk like this?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels exasperated and paranoid about being tracked and judged by those around him."
