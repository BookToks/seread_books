But after that, she seemed to avoid looking at or talking to him. She appeared distracted but kept glancing at Katerina Ivanovna, trying to make her happy. Neither Sonia nor Katerina Ivanovna had proper mourning clothes; Sonia was in dark clothing.\n\n“Look at him! What a fool! Why was he brought here?” Katerina Ivanovna said, turning to Amalia Ivanovna with a very serious face. “He’s not like those dressed-up people my father wouldn’t have hired as cooks. My late husband would have welcomed them if he had invited them out of kindness.”\n\n“Yes, he liked to drink, he really did!” shouted the clerk, downing his twelfth shot of vodka.\n\n“My late husband had that problem, and everyone knows it,” Katerina Ivanovna immediately replied. “But he was a good and honorable man who loved and respected his family. The problem was that his kindness made him trust the wrong people, and he drank with guys who weren’t worth anything. Can you believe it, Rodion Romanovitch? They found a gingerbread cock in his pocket! He was dead drunk, but he still thought of the kids!”\n\n“A cock? Did you say a cock?” yelled the clerk.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna didn’t answer. She sighed and seemed lost in her thoughts.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna defends her late husband’s character, emphasizing his kindness and love for his family despite his drinking problem."
