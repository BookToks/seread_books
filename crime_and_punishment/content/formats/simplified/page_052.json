  "text": "Dounia and I were too afraid to go to church because of the rude looks, whispers, and even loud comments about us. Everyone we knew avoided us; no one even said hello on the street. I found out that some shopkeepers and workers wanted to insult us by covering the gates of our house with pitch, which made our landlord tell us we had to leave. \n\nAll this trouble started because of Marfa Petrovna, who spread lies about Dounia and talked badly about her to everyone. She knows a lot of people in the area and was always coming into town. Since she talks a lot and complains about her husband, she quickly spread her story not just in town, but to the whole area. It made me sick, but Dounia handled it better than I did. If only you could see how she dealt with everything and tried to make me feel better! She is amazing!\n\nLuckily, our suffering didn’t last long. Mr. Svidrigaïlov came to his senses and felt sorry for Dounia. He showed Marfa Petrovna clear proof of Dounia’s innocence. This proof was a letter Dounia had to write for him before Marfa Petrovna found them in the garden. In that letter, she refused to meet with him privately and scolded him for his bad behavior towards Marfa.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia faces public scorn and slander due to Marfa Petrovna's gossip, but ultimately her innocence is proven by Mr. Svidrigaïlov's intervention."
