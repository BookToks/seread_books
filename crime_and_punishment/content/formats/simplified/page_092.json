He looked pale, his eyes were bright, and he felt tired all over, but suddenly he could breathe easier. He felt like he had let go of a heavy burden that had been weighing him down for a long time. All at once, he felt relief and peace in his heart. “Lord,” he prayed, “show me my way—I give up that cursed dream of mine.”\n\nAs he crossed the bridge, he looked calmly at the Neva River and the bright red sun setting in the sky.

He was free from that spell, that obsession!\n\nLater, when he thought back to that time and everything that happened day by day, he was strangely struck by one thing.

He could never understand why, when he was tired and worn out, he chose to go back through the Hay Market, even though it was out of his way and he didn’t need to go there.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist experiences a profound sense of relief and newfound freedom after renouncing his dark desires and reflecting on a seemingly fateful detour."
