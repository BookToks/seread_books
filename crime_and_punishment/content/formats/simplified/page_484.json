  "text": "A lawyer should know where he is, especially when he can get lost in his own thoughts, because he is still human! But the poor guy is harmed by his own criminal mind, which is unfortunate for him. Young people, caught up in their own cleverness, don’t think about this when they push past all limits, like you cleverly said yesterday. \n\nHe will lie—this man who is hiding his true self—and he will lie well, in a smart way. You might think he would win and enjoy his cleverness, but at the most exciting moment, he will faint. Sure, he might be sick or in a stuffy room, but still! He has given us an idea! He lied perfectly, but he didn’t consider his own feelings. That’s what gives him away! \n\nAnother time, he might get so caught up in his cleverness that he makes fun of the person who suspects him. He might turn pale on purpose to trick them, but his paleness will look too real, and again, he has given us an idea! Even if his questioner is fooled at first, they will think differently the next day if they’re not foolish, and it’s like that at every turn! \n\nHe puts himself in places where he shouldn’t be, talks too much when he should be quiet, and makes all sorts of clever references. He might even ask, “Why didn’t you catch me earlier?” And this can happen to the smartest people, like psychologists and writers. His feelings show everything like a mirror! Look into it and see what you find! But why do you look so pale, Rodion Romanovitch? Is the room too stuffy? Should I open the window?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage explores how a person's temperament can betray them, even when they attempt to deceive others with cleverness and wit."
