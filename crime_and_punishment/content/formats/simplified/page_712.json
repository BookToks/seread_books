  "text": "A girl had finally come in from the rain and was hiding behind a cupboard. She spent the night there, crying and shaking because she was scared of being beaten. He picked her up, took her back to his room, and sat her on the bed. Her torn shoes were soaked as if they had been in a puddle all night. After he undressed her, he put her on the bed, covered her up, and wrapped her in a blanket. She fell asleep right away. Then, he started to feel gloomy again.\n\nHe suddenly thought, “What a waste of time to worry about this.” Feeling annoyed, he picked up the candle to find the ragged attendant and hurry away. “Damn the child!” he thought as he opened the door, but he looked back to see if she was asleep. He lifted the blanket carefully. The girl was sleeping soundly, warm under the blanket, and her pale cheeks were flushed. But strangely, that blush looked brighter and rougher than a child's rosy cheeks. “It’s a fever,” he thought. It looked like she had been drinking, as if someone had given her a full glass. Her red lips were hot and glowing. But then he thought he saw her long black eyelashes twitching, as if her eyelids were opening and a sly eye was peeking out, pretending to be asleep. Yes, it seemed that way. Her lips parted in a smile, and the corners of her mouth moved as if she were trying to smile.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov finds a child hiding in his room, takes care of her, and reflects on her unsettling appearance and demeanor."
