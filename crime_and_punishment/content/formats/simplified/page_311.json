  "text": "I couldn't meet you at the train station, so I sent someone else instead. I also can't meet you tomorrow morning because I have important business in the Senate. I donâ€™t want to interrupt your family time while you see your son, and Avdotya Romanovna sees her brother.\n\nI will visit you tomorrow evening at eight o'clock. I kindly ask that Rodion Romanovitch does not come to our meeting. He insulted me during my last visit when he was sick, and I need to discuss something important with you that requires your explanation. \n\nIf Rodion is there despite my request, I will have to leave immediately, and it will be your fault. I believe Rodion, who seemed very sick during my visit, got better just two hours later and might come to see you too. I saw this for myself when I was at the place of a man who was drunk and got run over, and he gave his daughter money for a funeral, which surprised me because I know you were trying hard to raise that amount.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Luzhin requests that Rodion Romanovitch not be present at their upcoming meeting due to a previous affront."
