You have to admit that if the earrings from the old woman’s box ended up with Nikolay on the same day and at the same time, they must have gotten there somehow. That’s important in this situation.’  \n‘How did they get there? How did they get there?’ Razumihin shouted. ‘How can you, a doctor who studies people and knows more than anyone about human nature, not see the character of the man in this whole story? Don’t you realize that the answers he gave during the examination are completely true? He found the box and picked it up, just like he said.’  \n‘The complete truth! But didn’t he admit that he lied at first?’  \n‘Listen to me carefully. The porter, Koch, Pestryakov, the other porter, the wife of the first porter, the woman in the porter’s lodge, and the man Kryukov, who just got out of a cab with a lady, that’s eight or ten witnesses who all agree that Nikolay had Dmitri on the ground. He was lying on him, hitting him, while Dmitri was pulling his hair and hitting back. They were blocking the way, being yelled at by everyone while they were “like children” (the exact words of the witnesses), falling over each other, squealing, fighting, and laughing with silly faces, and then they ran into the street like kids. Now think about that.’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin argues that the presence of the ear-rings in Nikolay's possession suggests a connection to the crime, despite Nikolay's initial dishonesty."
