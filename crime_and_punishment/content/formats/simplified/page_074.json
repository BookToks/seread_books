They’ve thrown her out into the street like this. Look at her torn dress and how it’s put on; someone else dressed her, not herself, and it was done by someone who doesn’t know how to dress a woman, probably a man. \n\nNow look over there: I don’t know that guy I was about to fight, but he’s seen her on the road, drunk and not aware of what she’s doing. He really wants to take her away while she’s in this state. I’m sure of it; I saw him watching her and following her, but I stopped him. Now he’s moved away a bit and is pretending to make a cigarette. \n\nWe need to keep her away from him and figure out how to get her home. The policeman noticed everything quickly. The heavyset man was easy to figure out, so he turned his attention to the girl. The policeman leaned down to look at her more closely, and his face showed real concern. \n\n“Oh, how sad!” he said, shaking his head. “She’s just a child! You can tell she’s been tricked. Listen, miss,” he said to her, “where do you live?” The girl opened her tired, sleepy eyes, stared blankly at him, and waved her hand. \n\n“Here,” said Raskolnikov, feeling in his pocket and finding twenty copecks. “Here, call a cab and tell him to take her home.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov observes a vulnerable girl who has been deceived and is in danger, prompting him to intervene and protect her."
