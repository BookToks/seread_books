  "text": "\"You wrote,\" Raskolnikov said sharply, not looking at Luzhin, \"that I gave money yesterday not to the widow of the man who was killed, but to his daughter, whom I had never seen until yesterday. You wrote this to cause trouble between me and my family, and you added rude comments about a girl you don’t know. That is mean slander.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" Luzhin said, shaking with anger. \"I talked about your qualities and behavior in my letter only because your sister and mother asked me how I found you and what I thought of you. As for what you mentioned in my letter, please point out one lie. Show that you didn’t waste your money and that there aren’t bad people in that family, no matter how unfortunate they are.\"\n\n\"In my opinion, you, with all your good traits, are not worth even the little finger of that poor girl you insult.\"\n\n\"Would you really let her be around your mother and sister?\"\n\n\"I already have, if you want to know. I made her sit down today with my mother and Dounia.\"\n\n\"Rodya!\" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Dounia turned red, and Razumihin frowned. Luzhin smiled sarcastically.\n\n\"You can see for yourself, Avdotya Romanovna, if we can agree. I hope this question is settled now. I will leave so I don’t interrupt your family time.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confronts Luzhin over his slanderous letter, defending the character of a girl Luzhin disparaged."
