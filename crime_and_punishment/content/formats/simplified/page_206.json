  "text": "\"Oh, I see you're excited! Wait a minute. I forgot to ask you: what proof is there that the box came from the old woman?\"\n\n\"That's been proven,\" Razumihin said, looking unhappy and frowning. \"Koch recognized the jewelry box and named the owner, who showed that it really was his.\"\n\n\"That's bad. Now, another question. Did anyone see Nikolay when Koch and Pestryakov were going upstairs, and is there any proof of that?\"\n\n\"Nobody saw him,\" Razumihin replied, annoyed. \"That's the worst part. Even Koch and Pestryakov didn't notice him when they went upstairs. They said they saw the flat was open and thought work was happening there, but they didn't pay much attention and couldn't remember if there were actually men working inside.\"\n\n\"Hm! So the only evidence for the defense is that they were fighting and laughing. That seems strong, but... how do you explain the facts yourself?\"\n\n\"How do I explain them? What is there to explain? It's clear. At least, the direction for finding an explanation is clear, and the jewelry box points to it. The real murderer dropped those earrings. The murderer was upstairs, locked inside, when Koch and Pestryakov knocked on the door. Koch, being foolish, didn't stay at the door, so the murderer sneaked out and ran down because he had no other way to escape. He hid from Koch, Pestryakov, and the porter.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin discusses the lack of evidence regarding Nikolay's whereabouts during the murder, suggesting that the real murderer escaped unnoticed."
