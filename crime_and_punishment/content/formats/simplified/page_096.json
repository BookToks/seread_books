  "text": "**Crime and Punishment**  \n**Chapter VI**  \n\nLater, Raskolnikov found out why the huckster and his wife asked Lizaveta to come. It was a simple reason— a family that had just moved to town was very poor and needed to sell their household items and clothes, all of which were for women. Since these items wouldn’t sell for much at the market, they needed a dealer. Lizaveta did this kind of work often because she was honest, always set a fair price, and stuck to it. She usually spoke little and was very shy and submissive.\n\nBut Raskolnikov had become superstitious lately. These superstitions stayed with him for a long time and were hard to get rid of. He often thought there was something strange or mysterious about events and coincidences. The previous winter, a student he knew named Pokorev, who had gone to Harkov, had casually given him the address of Alyona Ivanovna, the old pawnbroker, in case he wanted to pawn something. For a long time, he didn’t go to her because he had lessons and was managing okay. Six weeks ago, he remembered the address because he had two things he could pawn: his father’s old silver watch and a small gold ring.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov learns about Lizaveta's work with a family in poverty, revealing his growing superstitions and connections to the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna."
