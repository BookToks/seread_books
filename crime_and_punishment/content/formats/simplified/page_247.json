Here was the flat on the second floor where Nikolay and Dmitri had been working. “It’s closed up and the door is freshly painted. So it’s for rent.” \n\nThen he went to the third and fourth floors. “Here!” He was surprised to find the door of the flat wide open. He could hear voices inside; he hadn’t expected that. After a moment of hesitation, he climbed the last stairs and entered the flat. It was also being fixed up; there were workers inside. This surprised him; he thought he would find everything as he left it, maybe even the bodies in the same spots on the floor. Instead, there were bare walls and no furniture; it felt strange. \n\nHe walked to the window and sat on the sill. There were two young workers, but one was much younger than the other. They were putting up new white wallpaper with lilac flowers, replacing the old, dirty yellow one. Raskolnikov felt really annoyed by this for some reason. He looked at the new paper with dislike, as if he wished it hadn’t changed. The workers were clearly staying late and were hurriedly rolling up their paper to go home. They didn’t notice Raskolnikov come in; they were chatting. \n\n“She comes to me in the morning,” the older one said to the younger, “very early, all dressed up. ‘Why are you fixing yourself up?’ I ask. ‘I’m ready to do anything to please you, Tit Vassilitch!’ That’s how she acts!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is disturbed to find the flat he once knew being renovated and occupied by workmen, contrasting his memories of the past."
