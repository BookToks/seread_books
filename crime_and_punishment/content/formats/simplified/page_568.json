There is law and justice; I will find it! Wait a moment, godless person! Polenka, stay with the children; I’ll come back. Wait for me, even if you have to wait in the street. We will see if there is justice!\"\n\nPutting on the green shawl that Marmeladov had mentioned to Raskolnikov, Katerina Ivanovna pushed her way through the messy and drunken crowd of lodgers still in the room. Crying and upset, she ran into the street, planning to find justice. Polenka, holding the two little ones, crouched in fear on a trunk in the corner, waiting for her mother to return. Amalia Ivanovna was angry, yelling, crying, and throwing everything on the floor. The lodgers were talking wildly; some tried to make sense of what happened, others argued and swore at each other, while some started singing.\n\n\"Now it’s time for me to go,\" thought Raskolnikov. \"Well, Sofya Semyonovna, we will see what you have to say now!\" And he headed toward Sonia’s place.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna, desperate for justice for her children, rushes into the street amidst chaos, leaving her terrified daughter behind."
