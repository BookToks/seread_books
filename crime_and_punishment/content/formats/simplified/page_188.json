Why the rush? Got a meeting? We have plenty of time. I’ve been waiting for you for the last three hours. I checked on you twice and saw you sleeping. I also tried to see Zossimov twice, but he wasn’t home. No big deal, he’ll show up. I was also busy with my own stuff today. You know I moved today, and now my uncle is living with me. But that’s not important. Let’s get to it. Give me the package, Nastasya. We’ll open it right away. How do you feel now, brother?’\n\n‘I feel fine, I’m not sick. Razumihin, have you been here long?’\n\n‘I told you I’ve been waiting for three hours.’\n\n‘No, I mean before that.’\n\n‘What do you mean?’\n\n‘How long have you been coming here?’\n\n‘I told you everything this morning. Don’t you remember?’\n\nRaskolnikov thought for a moment. The morning felt like a dream to him. He couldn’t remember and looked at Razumihin for help.\n\n‘Hmm!’ said Razumihin, ‘You’ve forgotten. I thought you weren’t quite yourself then. Now you look better after your sleep… You really look much better. Great! Now, let’s get to business. Look here, my dear boy.’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov wakes up from a long sleep to find Razumihin waiting for him and discussing their plans."
