  "text": "He felt a strong need to get up and go talk to Nikodim Fomitch. He wanted to tell him everything that happened yesterday and show him the things in the corner. The urge was so strong that he stood up to do it. Then he thought, “Shouldn’t I think this through first?” But he decided it was better to just share the burden without overthinking it.\n\nSuddenly, he froze in place. He heard Nikodim Fomitch talking excitedly with Ilya Petrovitch. He caught some of their words: “It’s impossible, they’ll both be let go. The whole story doesn’t make sense. Why would they call the porter if they were guilty? To turn themselves in? That’s too clever! Plus, Pestryakov, the student, was seen at the gate by both porters and a woman when he came in. He was with three friends who left him at the gate, and he asked the porters for directions in front of them. Would he have asked if he was up to something bad? As for Koch, he spent half an hour at the silversmith’s before going up to the old woman, and he left at exactly a quarter to eight. Think about it…”\n\n“But wait, how do you explain this problem? They said they knocked and the door was locked, but three minutes later when they went up with the porter, the door was open.”\n\n“That’s the point; the murderer must have been inside and locked the door. They would have caught him for sure if Koch hadn’t been foolish and gone to look for the porter.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Nikodim Fomitch discusses the contradictions in the case, suggesting that the accused will likely be released due to inconsistencies in the evidence."
