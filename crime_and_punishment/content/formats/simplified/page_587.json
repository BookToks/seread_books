I knew that if I questioned whether I had the right to gain power, I really didn’t have that right. If I wondered if people are worthless, it meant I didn’t think that way, even if someone else could go after what they wanted without doubts. \n\nI spent days worrying about whether someone like Napoleon would have done it. I knew I wasn’t Napoleon. I had to deal with all this inner struggle, and I wanted to escape it. I wanted to kill without overthinking it, just for myself. I didn’t want to lie to myself about it. I didn’t kill to help my mother or to gain wealth and power. That’s nonsense! I did it for myself, and I didn’t care if I helped others or hurt them. At that moment, I didn’t want money; I wanted something else. I understand it all now.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reflects on his motivations for murder, admitting it was for himself alone rather than for any noble cause."
