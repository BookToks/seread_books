  "text": "Svidrigaïlov listened carefully when he entered the room. He heard someone scolding another person, but he could only hear one voice. \n\nHe got up and looked through a crack in the wall. The other room was a bit bigger and had two men in it. One man had curly hair and a red face. He was standing like a speaker, without a coat, and was hitting his chest while talking loudly. He was blaming the other man for being a beggar and said he had helped him out of a bad situation. He claimed he could throw him out anytime, and that only fate knows what is happening.\n\nThe second man was sitting in a chair, looking like he really needed to sneeze but couldn’t. He looked confused and didn’t seem to understand what the first man was saying. On the table, there was a candle, some wine glasses, a nearly empty vodka bottle, bread, cucumber, and leftover tea.\n\nAfter looking at this, Svidrigaïlov turned away and sat back down on his bed. The ragged man who brought the tea asked if he wanted anything else, but Svidrigaïlov said no again. The man left, and Svidrigaïlov quickly drank some tea to warm up, but he couldn’t eat anything and started to feel feverish.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov observes a heated argument between two men in an adjacent room while feeling feverish and indifferent to his surroundings."
