You would think her background and education would have stopped her from going down such a terrible path. But what kept her going—surely it wasn't a bad attitude? All the awful things she faced had only touched her on the surface; they hadn’t truly affected her heart. He could see that clearly.\n\nHe thought, \"There are three paths for her: the canal, the madhouse, or, worst of all, a life of corruption that hardens the heart.\" The last option was the most disgusting, but he was young and cynical, so he couldn’t help but think it was the most likely outcome.\n\n\"But can that really be true?\" he asked himself. \"Can someone like her, who still has a pure spirit, really end up in that horrible place? Has that process already started? Has she only managed to cope so far because bad things are becoming less shocking to her? No, that can't be!\" he shouted, just like Sonia had done earlier. \"What has kept her from the canal until now is her belief in sin and the children... And if she hasn’t lost her mind... but who says she hasn’t? Is she really sane? Can someone talk and think like she does? How can she sit on the edge of such a disgusting situation and ignore the danger? Does she expect a miracle? She probably does. Doesn’t that mean she’s losing her mind?\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov contemplates Sonia's exceptional resilience amidst her degrading circumstances, questioning whether her purity can withstand the moral decay surrounding her."
