  "text": "The tavern was noisy. The tavern-keeper and the boys were busy with new customers. Marmeladov ignored them and kept telling his story. He seemed very weak, but as he drank more, he talked more. Remembering his recent success made him feel better, and it showed on his face. Raskolnikov listened carefully.\n\n\"That was five weeks ago,\" he said. \"When Katerina Ivanovna and Sonia heard about it, it was like I entered Heaven. Before, I was treated badly, but now they were quiet and careful around me. They said, 'Semyon Zakharovitch is tired from work; let him rest, shh!' They made me coffee before I went to work and even boiled cream for me! Can you believe it? They somehow found money for a nice outfit—eleven roubles and fifty copecks. I got boots, a cotton shirt-front, and a beautiful uniform, all for that price. \n\nWhen I came back from the office one morning, Katerina Ivanovna had cooked a two-course dinner—soup and salt meat with horseradish. We had never eaten like that before. She didn’t have any nice dresses, but she got ready as if she was going to a party. She fixed her hair nicely and put on a clean collar and cuffs. She looked like a different person—younger and prettier.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marmeladov recounts how his recent job success transformed his family's treatment of him, leading to a brief period of care and attention from Katerina Ivanovna and Sonia."
