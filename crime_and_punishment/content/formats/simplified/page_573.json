  "text": "\"Of course you’re right, Sonia,\" he finally said softly. He seemed different all of a sudden. His usual tone of arrogance and defiance was gone. His voice was weak. \"I told you yesterday that I wasn’t coming to ask for forgiveness, but almost the first thing I said was to ask for forgiveness... I talked about Luzhin and Providence for my own sake. I was asking for your forgiveness, Sonia...\"\n\nHe tried to smile, but his smile looked weak and incomplete. He lowered his head and covered his face with his hands. \n\nThen, unexpectedly, he felt a strange bitterness and hatred towards Sonia. Confused by this feeling, he looked at her closely. But he saw her worried and anxious eyes filled with love for him, and his hatred disappeared. It wasn't real; he had confused one feeling for another. It was a moment he had to face.\n\nHe hid his face in his hands again and bowed his head. Suddenly, he turned pale, got up from his chair, looked at Sonia, and without saying anything, sat down on her bed.\n\nAt that moment, he felt a strong reminder of when he had stood over the old woman with the axe in his hand and thought he couldn’t wait any longer. \n\n\"What’s the matter?\" Sonia asked, very scared. He couldn’t say a word. This wasn’t how he planned to share his feelings, and he didn’t understand what was happening to him. She approached him gently.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a profound internal conflict as he seeks forgiveness from Sonia, revealing his vulnerability and confusion."
