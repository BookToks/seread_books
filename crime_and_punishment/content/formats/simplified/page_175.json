And who are you?’ \n\n‘I am the messenger from our office, from the merchant Shelopaev, and I’ve come on business.’ \n\n‘Please sit down.’ Razumihin sat down on the other side of the table. ‘It’s a good thing you’re back to normal, brother,’ he said to Raskolnikov. ‘For the last four days, you have hardly eaten or drunk anything. We had to give you tea in small amounts. I brought Zossimov to see you twice. You remember Zossimov? He checked you carefully and said it was nothing serious—just something seemed off in your head. He thinks it’s from not eating well. You haven’t had enough beer and radish, but it’s nothing big, and you’ll be okay. Zossimov is really good! He is becoming quite well-known. Come on, I won’t hold you up,’ he said, looking at the messenger again. ‘Will you explain what you need? You must know, Rodya, this is the second time they have sent someone from the office; but it was a different man last time, and I talked to him. Who came before?’ \n\n‘That was the day before yesterday, if you please, sir. That was Alexey Semyonovitch; he is in our office too.’ \n\n‘He was smarter than you, don’t you think?’ \n\n‘Yes, indeed, sir, he is more important than I am.’ \n\n‘Exactly; go on.’ \n\n‘At your mama’s request, through Afanasy Ivanovitch Vahrushin, of whom I’m sure you have heard before, a payment is sent to you from our office,’ the man said.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is visited by a messenger from a merchant with news of a remittance sent to him at his mother's request."
