  "text": "Raskolnikov thought again about how clean everything was. He took a quick look at the cotton curtain over the door to another small room. That room had the old woman’s bed and chest of drawers, and he had never seen it before. These two rooms made up the whole apartment.\n\nThe old woman came into the room and looked at him seriously. “What do you want?” she asked.\n\n“I’ve brought something to pawn,” he said, taking out an old silver watch from his pocket. The back of the watch had a globe on it, and the chain was made of steel.\n\n“But your last pledge is overdue. It was due the day before yesterday,” she replied.\n\n“I’ll bring you the interest for another month. Just wait a bit.”\n\n“That’s up to me, my good sir. I can wait or sell your pledge right now.”\n\n“How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Ivanovna?” he asked.\n\n“You come with such small things; it’s hardly worth anything. I gave you two roubles for your ring last time, and you can buy a new one for a rouble and a half.”\n\n“Give me four roubles for it. I’ll get it back; it was my father’s. I’ll have money soon.”\n\n“A rouble and a half, and you’ll need to pay the interest in advance if you want!” she said.\n\n“A rouble and a half!” the young man shouted.\n\n“Suit yourself,” the old woman said, handing the watch back to him. He took it and was very angry.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov attempts to pawn a silver watch but is met with the old woman's harsh refusal and undervaluation of his item."
