  "text": "Raskolnikov thought again about how clean everything was. He looked curiously at the cotton curtain over the door to another small room. In that room were the old woman’s bed and chest of drawers, and he had never seen it before. These two rooms made up the entire flat.\n\nThe old woman came into the room and looked at him seriously. “What do you want?” she asked.\n\n“I’ve brought something to pawn,” he said, pulling out an old silver watch with a globe engraved on the back. The chain was steel.\n\n“But your last pledge is overdue. The month was up two days ago,” she replied.\n\n“I will bring you the interest for another month; just wait a little,” he said.\n\n“That's up to me. I can wait or sell your item right away,” she answered.\n\n“How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Ivanovna?” he asked.\n\n“You bring me such small things. It’s hardly worth anything. I gave you two roubles for your ring last time, and you could buy it new for a rouble and a half,” she said.\n\n“Give me four roubles for it. I will get it back. It was my father’s. I’ll have some money soon,” he pleaded.\n\n“I’ll give you a rouble and a half, and you’ll need to pay interest in advance if you want,” she said.\n\n“A rouble and a half!” he shouted. \n\n“Suit yourself,” she said, handing the watch back to him. He took it and felt very angry.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov attempts to pawn a silver watch but is met with the old woman's refusal and low offer, leading to his frustration."
