  "text": "Raskolnikov thought again about how clean everything was. He peeked at the curtain over the door to another small room that had the old woman’s bed and chest of drawers, a room he had never seen before. These two rooms were the whole flat.\n\n“What do you want?” the old woman asked sternly as she entered the room and looked him straight in the face.\n\n“I’ve brought something to pawn,” he replied, pulling out an old silver watch with a globe engraved on the back. The chain was made of steel.\n\n“But your last loan is due. The month was up two days ago.”\n\n“I’ll bring you the interest for another month; just wait a bit.”\n\n“That’s my choice, sir. I can wait or sell your item right away.”\n\n“How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Ivanovna?”\n\n“You come with such small things. It’s hardly worth anything. Last time, I gave you two roubles for your ring, and you could buy it new for a rouble and a half.”\n\n“Give me four roubles for it. I’ll get it back; it was my father’s. I’ll have some money soon.”\n\n“A rouble and a half, and I want the interest paid in advance, if you want it!”\n\n“A rouble and a half!” the young man shouted.\n\n“Do as you like,” the old woman said, handing the watch back to him. He took it and felt very angry.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov attempts to pawn a silver watch but is met with the old woman's harsh refusal and undervaluation of his item."
