  "text": "\"Crime and Punishment\"\n\nDear Avdotya Romanovna, \n\nI send my respect to you and your family. \n\nSincerely,  \nP. Luzhin\n\nPulcheria Alexandrovna started to cry. “What should I do now, Dmitri Prokofitch? How can I tell Rodya not to come? Yesterday he wanted us to say no to Pyotr Petrovitch, and now we are told not to let Rodya in! He will come for sure if he finds out, and what will happen then?”\n\n“Follow Avdotya Romanovna’s decision,” Razumihin replied calmly.\n\n“Oh dear! She says… I don’t even know what she means! She says it’s very important for Rodya to be here at eight o’clock and that they must meet. I didn’t want to show him the letter, but I need your help to stop him from coming because he is so touchy. Also, I don’t understand about that drunk man who died and his daughter, and how he could have given her all the money…”\n\n“That money cost you a lot, mother,” Avdotya Romanovna added.\n\n“He wasn’t himself yesterday,” Razumihin said thoughtfully. “If you only knew what he was doing at the restaurant yesterday, even though there was some sense in it… He did mention something about a dead man and a girl while we were going home, but I didn’t get it.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pulcheria Alexandrovna is distressed about how to handle Rodya's impending visit, fearing his reaction and the implications of a letter from Pyotr Petrovitch."
