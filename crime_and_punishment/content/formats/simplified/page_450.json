I wanted to go to Katerina Ivanovna….’\n\n‘You were walking in the streets?’\n\n‘Yes,’ Sonia whispered quickly, feeling confused and looking down.\n\n‘Katerina Ivanovna used to hit you, didn’t she?’\n\n‘Oh no, what are you saying? No!’ Sonia looked at him in shock.\n\n‘So you love her then?’\n\n‘Love her? Of course!’ Sonia said with a sad tone, clasping her hands in distress. ‘Ah, you don’t…. If you only knew! She is just like a child…. Her mind is not right because of her sorrow. And she used to be so smart… so generous… so kind! Ah, you don’t understand, you don’t understand!’\n\nSonia said this in despair, wringing her hands in excitement and worry. Her pale cheeks turned red, and there was pain in her eyes. It was clear that she wanted to speak, to defend, to express something. A deep compassion showed in every part of her face.\n\n‘Beat me! How can you? Good heavens, beat me! And if she did hit me, so what? You know nothing, nothing about it…. She is so unhappy… ah, how unhappy! And sick…. She is looking for what is right; she is pure. She believes there must be goodness everywhere.’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia expresses deep compassion for Katerina Ivanovna, emphasizing her suffering and innocence despite her mental instability."
