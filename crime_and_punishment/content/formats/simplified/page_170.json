  "text": "The fighting, crying, and cursing got louder and louder. Then, to his shock, Raskolnikov heard his landlady's voice. She was screaming and crying quickly and wildly, so he couldn't understand what she was saying. She was begging not to be hurt because she was being beaten on the stairs. The person hitting her sounded so angry that it was almost like a croak, but he was also shouting something, just as fast and unclear. Suddenly, Raskolnikov felt a shiver; he recognized the voice—it was Ilya Petrovitch. Ilya was here and hitting the landlady! He was kicking her and banging her head against the steps, which was clear from the sounds and cries. How could this be happening? \n\nHe could hear people running from all the floors and stairs, shouting and banging on doors. “But why, how could this be?” he thought, seriously wondering if he was going crazy. But no, he heard everything too clearly! They would likely come to him next, and it was probably about what happened yesterday. “Good God!” He wanted to lock his door, but he couldn't move his hand. Besides, it wouldn't help. Fear gripped his heart like ice, hurting him and making him feel numb. \n\nAfter about ten minutes, the noise began to calm down. The landlady was still moaning, and Ilya Petrovitch was still shouting threats and curses. But soon, he seemed to go quiet, and now he couldn't be heard. “Has he left? Good Lord!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is horrified to hear his landlady being violently beaten by Ilya Petrovitch, leading him to question his sanity amidst the chaos."
