  "text": "\"There are many different situations and choices, Avdotya Romanovna. A thief knows he is doing something wrong, but I heard about a man who opened the mail. He might have thought he was being proper! I wouldn’t have believed it if I hadn’t heard it myself, but I trust my own ears. He told Sofya Semyonovna all the reasons for it too, and at first, she couldn’t believe it, but in the end, she believed what she saw.\"\n\n\"What were the reasons?\"\n\n\"It’s a long story, Avdotya Romanovna. Let me explain. There’s a kind of idea I have. I think that one bad action can be okay if the main goal is good, like one mistake and many good actions! It’s frustrating for a young man who is talented and proud to know that if he had just three thousand, his whole life and future would be different, but he doesn’t have that money. On top of that, he feels irritable from being hungry, living in a bad place, wearing old clothes, and being very aware of his social status and that of his sister and mother. And then there’s also his pride and vanity, even though he might have some good traits too. I’m not judging him, so don’t think that; it’s not my place to do so. There’s also a special idea that divides people into two groups: those who are ordinary and those who are superior, meaning the law doesn’t apply to the superior ones because they make the rules for everyone else. It sounds good as a theory.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The conversation explores the justification of wrongdoing through a theory that posits some individuals are superior and above the law, leading to moral dilemmas and justifications for their actions."
