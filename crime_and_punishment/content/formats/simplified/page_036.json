  "text": "\"Crime and Punishment\"\n\n\"Are you sorry or not? He-he-he!\" \n\nMarmeladov wanted to fill his glass, but it was empty. \n\n\"What do you need pity for?\" shouted the tavern-keeper, who was nearby. \n\nPeople laughed and cursed. The laughter came from those listening and from others who just looked at the fired government clerk. \n\n\"To be pitied! Why should I be pitied?\" Marmeladov suddenly shouted, standing up with his arm out. It seemed he had been waiting for that question. \n\n\"Why should I be pitied? Yes! There's nothing to pity me for! I should be crucified, not pitied! Crucify me, oh judge, but don't pity me! I want tears and suffering, not fun! Do you think this drink was sweet for me? I was looking for suffering in it, and I found it. But He will have pity on us. He understands all people and all things. He is the true judge. \n\nOn that day, He will ask: 'Where is the daughter who gave herself for her sick stepmother and for the little children of another? Where is the daughter who cared for her filthy drunkard father, not afraid of his shame?' And He will say, 'Come to me! I have already forgiven you once... I have forgiven you once... Your many sins are forgiven.'\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marmeladov expresses a deep sense of suffering and the desire for understanding and forgiveness amidst his tribulations."
