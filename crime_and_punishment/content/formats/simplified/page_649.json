  "text": "He had a secret and had plans for Dounia. What if he still wanted to use those plans? It seemed likely he did. What if he learned something about Raskolnikov and used it against Dounia? \n\nThis idea often troubled his dreams, but it felt more real as he walked to Svidrigaïlov. Just thinking about it made him angry. If this happened, everything would change, including his own situation. He might have to confess his secret to Dounia. Would he need to turn himself in to stop Dounia from doing something stupid? \n\nDounia had received a letter that morning. Who could it be from in Petersburg? Maybe Luzhin? Razumihin was there to protect her, but he didn’t know the whole story. Should he tell Razumihin? The thought made him feel sick. \n\nHe decided he had to see Svidrigaïlov as soon as possible. Thank goodness the details of their meeting didn’t matter much, as long as he could get to the point. But if Svidrigaïlov was plotting against Dounia—then…\n\nRaskolnikov was so worn out from everything he had gone through that month that he could only think one thing: \"Then I will kill him,\" he thought in despair. \n\nA sudden pain filled his heart, and he stopped in the middle of the street, looking around to see where he was and which way to go. He found himself on X. Prospect, about thirty or forty steps from the Hay Market.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is tormented by the fear that Svidrigaïlov may use his knowledge of Raskolnikov's secret to manipulate or harm Dounia, leading him to contemplate violence against Svidrigaïlov."
