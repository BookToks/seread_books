How awful!’ \n\nShe rushed to Sonia and hugged her tightly. ‘Sonia! How could you take ten roubles from him? Silly girl! Give it to me! Give me the ten roubles right now—here!’ \n\nKaterina Ivanovna grabbed the money from Sonia, crumpled it up, and threw it at Luzhin’s face. It hit him in the eye and fell to the floor. Amalia Ivanovna quickly picked it up. Pyotr Petrovitch got angry. \n\n‘Hold that crazy woman!’ he yelled. \n\nAt that moment, several other people, including the two ladies, came into the room. \n\n‘What! Crazy? Am I crazy? You’re the fool!’ Katerina Ivanovna screamed. ‘You’re the real fool, you sneaky lawyer, you low man! Sonia, take his money! Sonia a thief? She would give away her last penny!’ Then Katerina Ivanovna started laughing hysterically. ‘Have you ever seen such a fool?’ She looked around. ‘And you?’ she suddenly noticed the landlady. ‘And you too, you greedy person, you say she’s a thief, you silly woman! She hasn’t even left this room: she came straight from you and sat down next to me, everyone saw her. She was here, by Rodion Romanovitch. Search her! Since she hasn’t left the room, the money should be on her! Search her, search her! But if you don’t find it, then…’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna defends Sonia against accusations of theft, passionately asserting her innocence and confronting Luzhin."
