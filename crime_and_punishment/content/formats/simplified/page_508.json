  "text": "**Crime and Punishment**  \n**Chapter I**  \n\nThe morning after the important meeting with Dounia and her mother made Pyotr Petrovitch think seriously. Even though it was very unpleasant, he had to slowly accept what had seemed impossible just the day before. He felt hurt and upset all night. When he got out of bed, he immediately looked in the mirror. He worried that he might be sick. But he seemed healthy, and looking at his clear, slightly chubby face made him feel a bit better. He thought he might find another bride, maybe even a better one. \n\nBut then he remembered his current situation and spat in frustration, which made his young friend, Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, smile sarcastically. Pyotr Petrovitch noticed the smile and added it to the list of things he didn’t like about his friend. He had already been keeping track of several things against him. He felt even angrier when he thought about how he shouldn’t have told Andrey about what happened in the meeting yesterday. That was another mistake he made because he was upset and acted too quickly.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pyotr Petrovitch grapples with his wounded vanity and irritation following an unpleasant interview, reflecting on his personal shortcomings and relationships."
