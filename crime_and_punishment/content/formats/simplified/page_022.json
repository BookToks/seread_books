  "text": "\"Crime and Punishment\"\n\n‘Honoured sir,’ he began almost seriously, ‘being poor is not a bad thing, that’s true. But I also know that being drunk is not good, and that’s even more true. But begging, honoured sir, begging is bad. When you’re poor, you can still keep your dignity, but when you beg, you lose it completely. People don’t just push you away; they make sure you feel humiliated, and that’s fair because I’m the first to humiliate myself when I beg. \n\nThat’s why I’m at this bar! Honoured sir, a month ago, Mr. Lebeziatnikov hit my wife, and my wife is very different from me! Do you understand? Let me ask you something out of curiosity: have you ever spent a night on a hay barge on the Neva?’\n\n‘No, I haven’t,’ answered Raskolnikov. ‘What do you mean?’\n\n‘Well, I just came from one, and it’s the fifth night I’ve slept like that….’ He filled his glass, drank it, and paused. There were bits of hay stuck to his clothes and hair. It looked like he hadn’t changed or washed in five days. His hands were especially dirty, fat and red, with black nails.\n\nHis talk seemed to catch the interest of the others. The boys at the counter started to giggle. The innkeeper came down from upstairs, probably to hear the ‘funny fellow’ and sat down nearby, yawning lazily but looking important. It was clear that Marmeladov was a regular here.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marmeladov reflects on the distinctions between poverty, drunkenness, and beggary, emphasizing the humiliation associated with the latter."
