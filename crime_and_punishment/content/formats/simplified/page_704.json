  "text": "Svidrigaïlov went to a small room at the end of the hall, under the stairs. All the other rooms were taken. He asked the ragged man there, \"Is there tea?\" The man replied, \"Yes, sir.\" Svidrigaïlov then asked, \"What else do you have?\" The man said, \"Veal, vodka, and snacks.\" Svidrigaïlov ordered tea and veal. The man seemed surprised and asked, \"Do you want anything else?\" Svidrigaïlov replied, \"No, nothing.\" The man left looking disappointed.\n\nSvidrigaïlov thought, \"This place must be nice. How did I not know about it? I probably look like I've come from a café and had some adventure.\" He wondered who else stayed there.\n\nHe lit a candle and looked around the room. It was so low that he could barely stand up. There was one window, and the dirty bed, a plain chair, and a table took up most of the space. The walls looked like they were made of wooden planks covered with old, torn paper that was too dusty to see the design, but the color was mostly yellow. One wall was shorter because of the sloping ceiling, but the room was not an attic; it was just under the stairs.\n\nSvidrigaïlov put down the candle, sat on the bed, and started to think. But he was distracted by a strange noise coming from the next room that sometimes got really loud.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov reflects on his surroundings in a cramped, shabby room while waiting for tea and veal."
