  "text": "\"Let’s go, sir,\" said Marmeladov suddenly, looking at Raskolnikov. \"Come with me... to Kozel’s house, where it looks into the yard. I need to see Katerina Ivanovna—it's time.\"\n\nRaskolnikov had been wanting to go and planned to help him. Marmeladov was more unsteady on his feet than in his words and leaned heavily on the young man. They had to walk two or three hundred steps. The drunk man became more upset and confused as they got closer to the house.\n\n\"I'm not afraid of Katerina Ivanovna now,\" he said nervously. \"I’m not worried about her pulling my hair. What does my hair matter? Forget my hair! It would be better if she did pull it; that’s not what scares me... it’s her eyes that frighten me... yes, her eyes... the redness on her cheeks scares me too... and how she breathes. Have you noticed how people breathe when they are excited? I’m also scared of the kids crying... because if Sonia hasn’t given them food... I don’t know what will happen! I don’t know! But I’m not afraid of being hit... Know this, sir, those hits don’t hurt me; they even feel good. I actually can’t live without it... it’s better this way. Let her hit me; it helps her feel better... it’s better this way... There’s the house. The house of Kozel, the cabinet-maker... a German, who is doing well. You lead the way!\"\n\nThey entered from the yard and went up to the fourth floor. The stairs got darker as they climbed. It was almost eleven o'clock and even though it was summer in Petersburg...\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marmeladov, in a state of dismay and confusion, expresses his fear of facing his wife Katerina Ivanovna and the potential consequences of their dire situation."
