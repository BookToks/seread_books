Nikodim Fomitch was in front of him, looking closely at him. He got up from the chair. \n\n\"What’s wrong? Are you sick?\" Nikodim Fomitch asked sharply. \n\n\"He could hardly hold his pen when he was signing,\" said the head clerk, sitting back down and getting back to work. \n\n\"Have you been sick long?\" Ilya Petrovitch called from where he was looking through papers. He had come to check on Raskolnikov when he fainted but left as soon as he woke up. \n\n\"Since yesterday,\" Raskolnikov mumbled in reply.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, feeling unwell, is questioned about his whereabouts and condition by Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch after fainting."
