Also, someone kissed me who would still care about me even if I had killed someone. I saw someone else there with a bright feather... but I'm rambling; I'm really weak, help me... we’ll be at the stairs soon...\"\n\n\"What’s wrong? Are you okay?\" Razumihin asked, worried.\n\n\"I feel a bit dizzy, but that’s not the main issue. I'm very sad... like a woman. Look at that! Look!\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Don’t you see? There’s a light in my room! Through the crack...\"\n\nThey reached the bottom of the last stairs, near the landlady’s door, and could see a light in Raskolnikov’s room.\n\n\"Strange! Maybe it’s Nastasya,\" Razumihin said.\n\n\"She’s never in my room at this time and should be in bed by now, but... I don’t care! Goodbye!\"\n\n\"What do you mean? I'm coming with you; we’ll go in together!\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses his sadness and confusion to Razumihin after a troubling experience at a death-bed, indicating his emotional turmoil."
