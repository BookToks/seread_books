I noticed because I thought you were trying to help her without me seeing. I watched you and saw you slip it into her pocket. I saw it, I swear.\n\nLebeziatnikov was almost out of breath. Everyone reacted with surprise, but some looked angry. They all gathered around Pyotr Petrovitch. Katerina Ivanovna ran to Lebeziatnikov.\n\n“I was wrong about you! Protect her! You’re the only one who can help her! She is an orphan. God has sent you!” Katerina Ivanovna, not really knowing what she was doing, fell to her knees in front of him.\n\n“That's a bunch of nonsense!” Luzhin yelled, getting angry. “What you’re saying is ridiculous! You think you noticed something—what does it matter? Did I give it to her secretly on purpose? Why would I do that? What does this have to do with me?”\n\n“I don’t know why, but I know what I saw! I’m sure of it! Instead of being wrong, I remember thinking about it right when I was thanking you and shaking your hand. Why did you put it secretly in her pocket? Why did you do it secretly?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Lebeziatnikov witnesses Luzhin secretly giving a hundred-rouble note to Sofya, prompting a confrontation about his intentions."
