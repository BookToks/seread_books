  "text": "Rodya has a mother who would use her small pension of one hundred twenty-five roubles to help him, even if it means she has to go without food. He also has a sister who would do anything for him. That’s what he was counting on. \n\nI know a lot about your situation now, my dear boy. It’s not surprising you were honest with Pashenka when you were thinking of marrying her. I’m saying this as a friend. An honest and caring person is open, but a business person just listens and takes advantage of you. \n\nPashenka gave an IOU to Tchebarov to pay for something, and he quickly demanded payment. When I heard this, I wanted to confront him to feel better, but by then, things were good between me and Pashenka. I insisted on stopping the whole thing and promised that you would pay. I took responsibility for you. \n\nDo you understand? We called Tchebarov, gave him ten roubles, and got the IOU back. Now she trusts you. Here, take it; I’ve torn it up. \n\nRazumihin placed the note on the table. Raskolnikov looked at him but turned to the wall without saying anything. Even Razumihin felt a little bad. \n\n“I see, brother,” he said after a moment, “that I’ve been foolish again. I thought my talking would cheer you up, but I think I’ve only made you upset.” \n\n“Were you the one I didn’t recognize when I was sick?” Raskolnikov asked after a pause, without turning his head.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin helps Raskolnikov by settling a debt and presenting him with a note, highlighting the support of family and friends amidst Raskolnikov's struggles."
