  "text": "At nine o’clock, Razumihin arrived at Bakaleyev’s house. The two ladies were waiting for him, looking nervous. They had gotten up early. He walked in looking very serious, bowed awkwardly, and then got angry with himself for it. Pulcheria Alexandrovna rushed up to him, grabbed his hands, and almost kissed them. He looked at Avdotya Romanovna, but instead of the mean looks he expected, she looked grateful and friendly. This surprised him more than if she had yelled at him. Luckily, there was something to talk about, so he quickly jumped into the conversation.\n\nPulcheria Alexandrovna was happy to hear that everything was fine and that Rodya was still asleep. She said she needed to discuss something important first. Then she asked about breakfast and invited him to join them, saying they had waited to eat with him. Avdotya Romanovna rang for a waiter, who came looking dirty and ragged. They asked him to bring tea, which finally arrived, but it was served in a messy way that embarrassed the ladies. Razumihin started to talk about the place but remembered Luzhin and felt awkward. He was relieved when Pulcheria Alexandrovna started asking him questions non-stop. He talked for about forty-five minutes.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin visits the ladies at Bakaleyev's house, where he is met with unexpected gratitude and a desire to discuss important matters."
