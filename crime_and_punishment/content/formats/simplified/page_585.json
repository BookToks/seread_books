You’ve been in my space, you’ve seen it…. Do you know, Sonia, that low ceilings and small rooms make you feel trapped? Ah, how I hated that attic! And still, I wouldn’t leave it! I didn’t want to on purpose! I stayed inside for days, and I wouldn’t work or even eat. I just lay there doing nothing. If Nastasya brought me food, I ate it; if she didn’t, I went all day without asking for anything because I was being stubborn! At night, I had no light; I lay in the dark and wouldn’t spend money on candles. I should have studied, but I sold my books. The dust on my notebooks is an inch thick. I preferred lying still and thinking. And I kept thinking…. I had strange dreams all the time, but I won’t describe them! I started to wonder why I was so foolish. If others are foolish—and I know they are—why can’t I be smarter? Then I realized, Sonia, that waiting for everyone to get smarter would take too long…. Later, I understood that it would never happen, that people won’t change, and it’s not worth trying to change them. Yes, that’s true. That’s just how people are, Sonia, … that’s true! … And now I know, Sonia, that whoever is strong in mind and spirit will have power over them. Anyone who is very bold is right in their eyes. The person who looks down on most things will be a leader among them, and the one who dares the most will be the most correct!\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reflects on his isolation and the futility of waiting for others to change, concluding that true power lies in strength of mind and daring."
