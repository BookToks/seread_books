  "text": "A guy named Karl hit another guy in the eye, and then he hit a girl named Henriette in the eye too. After that, he slapped me five times on the cheek. It was really rude in a nice place, Mr. Captain, and I screamed. Then he opened the window over the canal and started squealing like a little pig. It was embarrassing. Can you believe he was squealing like that in the street? How awful! \n\nKarl pulled him away from the window by his coat, and it’s true, Mr. Captain, he tore his coat. Then the guy shouted that he wanted fifteen roubles for the damage. I ended up paying him five roubles for his coat. He is a rude visitor and caused all this trouble. He said, \"I will tell all the newspapers about you.\"\n\n\"Was he an author?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Captain, and what a rude visitor in a nice place...\"\n\n\"Alright! That's enough! I’ve told you before...\"\n\n\"Ilya Petrovitch!\" the head clerk said with meaning.\n\nThe assistant quickly looked at him, and the head clerk shook his head a little.\n\n\"So, I’m telling you this, Luise Ivanovna, and I mean it for the last time,\" the assistant continued. \"If there’s another scandal in your nice house, I will have to put you in jail, as polite people say. Do you understand? So a writer took five roubles for his torn coat in a nice place? What a group these authors are!\" \n\nHe looked at Raskolnikov with disdain. \"There was also a scandal the other day in a restaurant.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The assistant expresses disdain for authors, labeling them as ungentlemanly and scandalous in society."
