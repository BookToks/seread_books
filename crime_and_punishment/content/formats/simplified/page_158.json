Not even Nastasya had touched it. But how could he have left all those things hidden?\n\nHe rushed to the corner, reached under the paper, pulled out the items, and filled his pockets with them. There were eight things in total: two small boxes with earrings or something like that, though he barely looked at them; then four small leather cases. There was also a chain wrapped in newspaper and something else in newspaper that looked like a decoration. He put them all into different pockets of his coat and the remaining pocket of his pants, trying to hide them as much as he could. He took the purse too. \n\nThen he left his room, leaving the door open. He walked quickly and confidently, and even though he felt weak, he was still aware of what was happening. He was scared of being caught. He worried that soon, maybe in half an hour or even a quarter of an hour, someone would start looking for him. So, he had to hide everything before that happened. He needed to clean it all up while he still had some strength and clear thinking left. Where was he supposed to go? \n\nThat had already been decided: “Throw them into the canal.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov frantically searches his room for stolen items, fearing discovery and contemplating how to dispose of them."
