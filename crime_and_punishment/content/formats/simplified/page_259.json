  "text": "At home, Katerina Ivanovna worked hard at night while everyone else was asleep. She wanted to get the wet laundry hung up to dry by morning. When Raskolnikov asked her to take a basin of water, she almost fell because it was too heavy. Raskolnikov found a towel, wet it, and started to clean the blood off Marmeladov’s face.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna stood nearby, struggling to breathe and holding her chest. She needed help too. Raskolnikov started to think that bringing the injured man here might have been a mistake. The policeman seemed unsure as well.\n\n“Polenka,” Katerina Ivanovna shouted, “run to Sonia quickly. If she’s not home, tell her that her father has been run over and she needs to come here right away. Hurry, Polenka! Here, put on the shawl.”\n\n“Run as fast as you can!” the little boy on the chair suddenly yelled, then went back to sitting still, with wide eyes and his feet awkwardly positioned.\n\nThe room got so crowded that there was hardly any space. Most of Madame Lippevechsel’s lodgers came in from other rooms. At first, they were crammed in the doorway, but soon they filled the whole room. Katerina Ivanovna became very angry.\n\n“At least let him die in peace!” she shouted at them.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna struggles to manage the chaos and concern surrounding her injured husband, Marmeladov, while Raskolnikov attempts to assist."
