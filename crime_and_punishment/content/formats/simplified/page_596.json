Why did I have to ruin her life? How awful of me!” \n\n“I will stay alone,” he said firmly, “and she won't come to the prison!”\n\nFive minutes later, he lifted his head and smiled strangely. That was a strange thought. \n\n“Maybe it would be better in Siberia,” he suddenly thought. \n\nHe couldn’t say how long he sat there with unclear thoughts racing in his mind. Suddenly, the door opened, and Dounia walked in. At first, she stood in the doorway and looked at him, just like he had done with Sonia. Then she came in and sat down in the same chair as yesterday, facing him. He stared at her silently and blankly. \n\n“Don’t be mad, brother; I’m only here for a minute,” Dounia said. \n\nHer face looked serious but not harsh. Her eyes were bright and gentle. He could see that she had come to him with love. \n\n“Brother, now I know everything. Dmitri Prokofitch has explained everything to me. They are bothering you because of a silly and unfair suspicion. Dmitri Prokofitch told me that you are not in danger, and you shouldn’t look at it so badly. I don’t think so, and I completely understand why you are upset.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels a profound sense of loneliness and guilt for burdening Sonia with his troubles, contemplating isolation as a better alternative."
