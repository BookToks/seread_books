  "text": "I noticed Avdotya Romanovna right away and saw the danger. I decided not to look at her at all. But guess what? Avdotya Romanovna made the first move. Can you believe it? Marfa Petrovna was actually mad at me for not talking about your sister and for not paying attention to her praise of Avdotya Romanovna. I don’t know what she wanted!\n\nMarfa Petrovna told Avdotya Romanovna everything about me. She had this annoying habit of sharing all our family secrets and complaining about me. Of course, she would share with her new friend! I bet they talked about me a lot, and Avdotya Romanovna probably heard all the rumors about me. I’m sure you’ve heard some of those too, right?\n\n“I have. Luzhin said you caused a child's death. Is that true?” \n\n“Please don’t bring up those silly stories,” Svidrigaïlov said, looking disgusted. “If you really want to know about that nonsense, I’ll tell you another time, but not now…”\n\n“I also heard about a footman you treated badly.”\n\n“Please drop it,” Svidrigaïlov interrupted, clearly annoyed.\n\n“Is that the footman who came to you after he died to fill your pipe? You told me about it yourself.” Raskolnikov was getting more irritated.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov reflects on the gossip surrounding him and his relationships, particularly regarding Avdotya Romanovna and Marfa Petrovna's influence."
