To cheer her up, Razumihin told her how Raskolnikov helped a poor student and his sick father. He also shared that Raskolnikov had been hurt while saving two little kids from a fire. These stories made Pulcheria very happy, and she talked about them all the time, even to strangers in the street, with Dounia by her side. \n\nDounia worried about her mother’s excitement. She feared that someone might mention Raskolnikov's name or the recent trial. Pulcheria even found out where the mother of the two children Raskolnikov saved lived and wanted to visit her. \n\nEventually, Pulcheria became very restless. She would suddenly cry and often felt ill. One morning, she said she thought Rodya would be home soon, remembering he told her to expect him back in nine months. She started getting ready for his return, cleaning the room and putting up new decorations. Dounia was worried but didn’t say anything and helped her mother prepare.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pulcheria Alexandrovna becomes increasingly anxious and ill as she prepares for her son Raskolnikov's return, reflecting her disordered imagination and emotional turmoil."
