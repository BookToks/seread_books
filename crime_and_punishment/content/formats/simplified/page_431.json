He was very confident in himself and thought the others were weak. He couldn’t believe it even now. He turned pale, and his lips shook.\n\n“Avdotya Romanovna, if I leave this door now after being dismissed like this, you can be sure I will never come back. Think about what you’re doing. My word is not to be broken.”\n\n“What rudeness!” cried Dounia, jumping up from her seat. “I don’t want you to come back again.”\n\n“What! So that’s how it is!” cried Luzhin, unable to believe the situation and completely thrown off. “So that’s how it is! But do you know, Avdotya Romanovna, that I might protest?”\n\n“What right do you have to speak to her like that?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna shouted angrily. “And what can you protest about? What rights do you have? Am I supposed to give my Dounia to a man like you? Go away, leave us alone! It’s our fault for agreeing to something wrong, especially mine…”\n\n“But you have bound me, Pulcheria Alexandrovna,” Luzhin yelled in anger, “by your promise, and now you deny it and… besides… I have spent money because of that…”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia firmly rejects Pyotr Petrovitch's advances, leading to a heated confrontation with her family."
