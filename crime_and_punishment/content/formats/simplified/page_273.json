  "text": "Raskolnikov called for Razumihin. He came out looking really happy. It was clear he had been drinking a lot. Even though he usually handles alcohol well, this time it was obvious he was affected. \n\n\"Listen,\" Raskolnikov said quickly, \"I just came to tell you that you won your bet, and no one knows what might happen to him. I can't come in; I'm so weak I might fall over. So, good evening and goodbye! Come see me tomorrow.\"\n\n\"I'll walk you home. If you say you're weak, then I must,\" Razumihin replied.\n\n\"What about your visitors? Who's that curly-haired guy who just peeked out?\" Raskolnikov asked.\n\n\"Who knows? Maybe he's a friend of my uncle's, or he might have come without being invited. I'll leave my uncle with them; he's a great person. It's a shame I can't introduce you to him now. But forget them! They won't notice me, and I need some fresh air. You came just in time—another two minutes and I would have gotten into an argument! They're saying such crazy things… you can't imagine what people will say! But why shouldn't you imagine? Don't we talk nonsense too? Let them talk… that's how we learn not to! Wait a minute, I'll get Zossimov.\"\n\nZossimov quickly focused on Raskolnikov; he seemed very interested in him and soon looked happier. \"You need to go to bed right away,\" he said, checking Raskolnikov as best as he could, \"and take something for your health.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, feeling weak and overwhelmed, informs Razumihin of his victory in a bet while expressing his need for fresh air and rest."
