They whispered until two o'clock, but the girl went to bed earlier, feeling amazed and a bit sad.\n\nMeanwhile, Svidrigaïlov crossed the bridge back to the mainland right at midnight. The rain had stopped, but the wind was strong. He felt cold and looked at the dark waters of the Little Neva with interest. But it was too cold to stay there, so he walked towards Y. Prospect. He walked down the long street for almost half an hour, stumbling in the dark on the wooden path, looking for something on the right side. He remembered that there was a hotel at the end of the street, made of wood and fairly big, called something like Adrianople. He wasn't wrong: the hotel stood out in that lonely place, and he could see it even in the dark. It was a long, dark wooden building, and even though it was late, there were lights on inside. He went in and asked a shabby man in the hallway for a room.
