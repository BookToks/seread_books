  "text": "\"Wait! Let me finish. They looked everywhere for Nikolay. They held Dushkin and searched his house. Dmitri was also arrested, and they checked the Kolomensky men too. The day before yesterday, they found Nikolay in a bar at the edge of town. He had taken the silver cross off his neck and traded it for a drink. A few minutes later, a woman went to the cowshed and saw through a crack in the wall that he had made a noose with his sash from a beam. He stood on a block of wood and was trying to put his neck in the noose. The woman screamed, and people rushed in. 'So this is what you’re doing!' he said. 'Take me to that police officer; I’ll confess everything.' So, they brought him to the police station with some guards.\n\nThey asked him questions like how old he was. 'Twenty-two,' he replied. When they asked, 'Did you see anyone on the staircase when you were working with Dmitri?' he said, 'People might have gone up and down, but I didn’t notice them.' They asked, 'Did you hear any noise?' He answered, 'Nothing special.' Then they told him about the murders of Widow So-and-so and her sister on the same day. He said, 'I didn’t know anything about that. I first heard about it from Afanasy Pavlovitch the day before yesterday.' They asked, 'Where did you find the earrings?' He replied, 'I found them on the pavement.' They continued, 'Why didn’t you work with Dmitri the other day?' He said, 'Because I was drinking.' They asked, 'Where were you drinking?' He answered, 'Oh, at such-and-such a place.' 'Why did you run away from Dushkin’s?' He didn’t finish that part.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Nikolay was arrested after attempting suicide and confessed to knowing nothing about the murders he was implicated in."
