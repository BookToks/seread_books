  "text": "**Crime and Punishment**  \n**Chapter V**  \n\nThere was a man who was not young anymore. He looked stiff and heavy, and had a serious and sour face. He stopped suddenly in the doorway, looking around with a shocked expression, as if he was confused about where he was. He looked at Raskolnikov’s small and messy room with distrust, pretending to be scared and a bit offended. \n\nHe stared at Raskolnikov, who was lying on his dirty sofa, looking unkempt and not washed, just staring back at him. Then he looked closely at Razumihin, who was also messy and unshaven, but looked back at him boldly without getting up. There was an awkward silence for a couple of minutes. \n\nThen, realizing he wouldn’t impress them, the man relaxed a bit. He spoke politely but firmly, clearly stressing each word, and asked Zossimov:  \n“Is this Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, a student, or a former student?”  \n\nZossimov moved slightly, ready to answer, but Razumihin spoke up first.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A pompous gentleman enters Raskolnikov's cramped living space, initially shocked by the disheveled state of its occupants."
