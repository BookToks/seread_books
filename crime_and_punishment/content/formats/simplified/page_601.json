You don’t understand; you’re like a child!” she shouted, breathing heavily and coughing. “I told you I’m not going back to that drunk German. Let everyone in Petersburg see the children begging in the streets, even though their father was a good man who worked honestly all his life and died serving. I believe that!” (Katerina had made up this story and really believed it.) “Let that awful general see it! And you’re silly, Sonia: what do we have to eat? Tell me that. We’ve troubled you enough; I won’t keep going! Ah, Raskolnikov, is that you?” she cried, running up to him. “Please explain to this silly girl that this is the best thing we can do! Even organ-grinders make a living, and everyone will see that we are different, that we are a good family fallen into poverty. That general will lose his job, you’ll see! We will perform in front of his windows every day, and if the Tsar drives by, I’ll kneel down, put the children in front of me, show them to him, and say, ‘Help us, Father.’ He is the father of the fatherless; he is kind, he’ll protect us, you’ll see! And that awful general… Lida, stand up straight! Kolya, you’ll dance again. Why are you crying? Stop crying! What are you scared of, silly? What am I supposed to do with them, Raskolnikov?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna insists on begging in the streets to expose their plight, despite Sonia's pleas to return home."
