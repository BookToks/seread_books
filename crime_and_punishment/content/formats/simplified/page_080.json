  "text": "Raskolnikov had to stop going to university, but it was only temporary. He was trying hard to save money so he could go back to school. \n\nHe hadn't seen Razumihin in four months, and Razumihin didn't even know where he lived. A couple of months ago, they saw each other on the street, but Raskolnikov turned away and crossed to the other side so he wouldn't be seen. Razumihin noticed him but decided to keep walking because he didn't want to bother him.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov has distanced himself from Razumihin, despite his desire to return to university and the latter's willingness to help."
