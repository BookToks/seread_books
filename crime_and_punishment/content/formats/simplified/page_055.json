At first, we were very surprised because everything happened so quickly and unexpectedly. We talked about it all day.\n\nHe is a wealthy man who can be relied on. He has two government jobs and has already made his fortune. He is forty-five years old, but he looks good and could still be attractive to women. Overall, he is a respectable man, though he seems a bit gloomy and proud. But maybe that’s just the first impression.\n\nBe careful, dear Rodya, when he comes to Petersburg soon. Don’t judge him too quickly or harshly, as you sometimes do when you don’t like something at first. I warn you, but I believe he will make a good impression on you. To really understand someone, you need to be careful and avoid jumping to conclusions, which can be hard to change later. \n\nFrom what I can tell, Pyotr Petrovitch seems like a good man. When he visited us, he said he was practical, but he also shares many ideas of the younger generation and is against all prejudices. He talked a lot because he likes to be listened to, but that’s not really a bad thing. I didn’t understand everything he said, though.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A well-to-do, somewhat conceited man named Pyotr Petrovitch has proposed marriage to Dounia, prompting discussions about his character and the importance of not forming hasty judgments."
