  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nI want to be clear that this needs to be sorted out today. If you care about me at all, we have to end this situation, even if it's hard. If my brother did something wrong, he will apologize.\n\n\"I'm surprised you're asking that,\" Luzhin said, getting more annoyed. \"I can really care for you and still dislike someone in your family. Even though I want to marry you, I can't take on responsibilities that don't fit with that.\"\n\n\"Please don’t take offense, Pyotr Petrovitch,\" Dounia said with feeling. \"Be the sensible and generous man I believe you are. I’ve made a big promise to you; I’m engaged to you. Trust me in this, and I will judge fairly. My role as a judge is surprising for both you and my brother. When I asked him to come today after your letter, I didn’t tell him what I planned to do. If you two can’t get along, I will have to choose between you—either you or him. That’s how it stands for both of you. I need to make the right choice, and I can’t be wrong. For your sake, I may have to cut ties with my brother, and for my brother’s sake, I may have to end things with you. I want to find out if he is truly my brother, and I want to know if you care about me and value me.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia insists that she must choose between her brother and her fiancé, Pyotr Petrovitch, to resolve their conflict."
