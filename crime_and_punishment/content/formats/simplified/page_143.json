  "text": "The chief clerk was writing something while a very large woman, dressed very nicely with a big brooch on her chest, stood nearby, waiting for something. Raskolnikov gave his notice to the head clerk. The clerk looked at it, said, \"Wait a minute,\" and continued helping the woman in mourning.\n\nHe felt a little better. \"It can't be that!\" he thought. Gradually, he began to feel more confident and told himself to stay calm.\n\n\"Some silly mistake could give me away! It’s a shame there’s no air here,\" he added, \"it’s so stuffy... it’s making my head spin… and my thoughts too...\"\n\nHe felt a lot of inner chaos. He was scared of losing control; he tried to focus on something random, but he couldn’t do it. Still, the head clerk caught his interest, and he hoped to figure something out by looking at his face.\n\nThe head clerk was very young, around twenty-two, with a dark, lively face that looked older. He was dressed in a stylish way, with his hair neatly parted and styled, and wore several rings on his clean fingers and a gold chain on his vest. He spoke a few words in French to a foreigner in the room, and he said them quite well.\n\n\"Luise Ivanovna, you can sit down,\" he said casually to the brightly dressed, purple-faced lady, who was still standing.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences inner turmoil and anxiety while waiting in a stifling office filled with various people."
