  "text": "Sofya and I worked hard to find the children. She is banging on a frying pan and making the kids dance. The children are crying and keep stopping at the streets and shops. There’s a crowd of people chasing after them. \"Come on!\" \n\n\"And Sonia?\" Raskolnikov asked, worried as he followed Lebeziatnikov.\n\n\"She's really upset. Well, it's not just Sofya who's upset, but Katerina Ivanovna is completely frantic. I mean, she’s really lost it. They might get taken to the police. Just imagine how that would go… They’re by the canal near the bridge, not far from where Sofya lives.\"\n\nAt the canal by the bridge, close to Sonia’s place, there was a crowd mostly made up of street kids. You could hear Katerina Ivanovna shouting from the bridge, and it was quite a sight that drew a crowd. She was in her old dress with a green shawl and a torn straw hat that looked terrible. She was really frantic. She looked tired and sick, and being outside made her look even worse. But she didn’t slow down; she kept getting more and more upset. She ran at the kids, yelled at them, tried to get them to dance, and told them how to do it in front of everyone.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna is in a frantic state, desperately trying to manage the children and attract attention from the crowd."
