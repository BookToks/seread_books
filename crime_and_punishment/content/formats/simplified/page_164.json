Razumihin was wearing a torn dressing gown and slippers, and he looked surprised.\n\n“Is it you?” he exclaimed. He looked Raskolnikov up and down, then whistled. “You look really bad! Why, brother, you’ve outdone me!” he said, noticing Raskolnikov's worn clothes. “Come sit down, you must be tired.”\n\nAfter Raskolnikov sank down on the old sofa, which was in worse shape than his own, Razumihin quickly saw that he was not well. \n\n“You are seriously ill, you know that?” He started to check Raskolnikov's pulse. Raskolnikov pulled his hand away. \n\n“Never mind,” he said. “I came for this: I have no lessons… I wanted to, but I don’t really want lessons…”\n\n“But I say! You are out of it, you know!” Razumihin said, watching him closely.\n\n“No, I am not.” \n\nRaskolnikov got up from the sofa. When he climbed the stairs to Razumihin’s, he hadn’t realized he would be seeing his friend face to face. Now, he felt that he really didn’t want to be around anyone at that moment. Anger rose inside him, and he almost choked with frustration as soon as he entered Razumihin’s room.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov visits Razumihin, revealing his ill state and inner turmoil while expressing a reluctance to engage with anyone."
