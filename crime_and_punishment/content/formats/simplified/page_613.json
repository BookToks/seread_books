  "text": "A strange time started for Raskolnikov. It felt like a fog had surrounded him, leaving him alone and trapped with no way out. Later, when he thought back on this time, he felt that his mind was sometimes unclear, and this lasted until everything fell apart. He believed he had made mistakes about many things, like the dates of certain events. When he tried to remember things later, he learned a lot about himself from what others said. He had mixed up events and thought things were caused by situations that only existed in his mind.\n\nSometimes, he felt deep anxiety, almost panic. But he also remembered times, maybe whole days, when he felt completely numb, like someone who is dying. During those moments, he seemed to be trying to avoid fully understanding his situation. There were important facts he needed to think about, but they bothered him a lot. He wished he could be free from some worries, as ignoring them could lead to his total ruin.\n\nHe was especially anxious about Svidriga√Ølov.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a disorienting period of solitude and mental turmoil, struggling to reconcile his thoughts and fears amidst impending catastrophe."
