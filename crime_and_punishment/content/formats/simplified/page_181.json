Anyway, brother, to make a long story short, I planned to shake things up here to get rid of all the bad stuff around, but Pashenka won. I didn’t expect to find her so… nice. What do you think?’  \nRaskolnikov didn’t answer but looked at him with worry.  \n‘And everything is just right in every way,’ Razumihin continued, not at all bothered by the silence.  \n‘Oh, you sly one!’ Nastasya yelled again. She was really enjoying this conversation.  \n‘It’s a shame, brother, that you didn’t handle things better at first. You should have approached her differently. She is a very unpredictable person. But we’ll talk about her later… How could you let it get to the point where she stopped bringing you dinner? And that I O U? You must have been crazy to sign an I O U. And that promise of marriage when her daughter, Natalya Yegorovna, was alive? … I know all about it! But I see that’s a sensitive topic, and I’m being foolish; forgive me. But speaking of foolishness, you know Praskovya Pavlovna isn’t as silly as you might think.’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin discusses the complexities of a woman's character and Raskolnikov's past decisions regarding her."
