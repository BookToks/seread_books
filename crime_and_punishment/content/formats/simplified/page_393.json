A fly buzzed and hit the window. At that moment, he saw something like a cloak hanging in the corner between the window and a small cupboard. “Why is that cloak here?” he wondered. “It wasn’t there before….” \n\nHe quietly walked over and felt that someone was hiding behind it. He carefully moved the cloak and saw the old woman sitting in a chair, bent over so he couldn’t see her face. He stood over her and thought, “She is afraid.” He quietly took the axe from where it was hanging and struck her once, then again on the head. But strangely, she didn’t move, like she was made of wood. He got scared, leaned down closer to look at her, but she lowered her head even more. He crouched down and peeked up at her face, and he felt cold with fear: the old woman was sitting there laughing silently, trying hard not to let him hear. \n\nSuddenly, he thought he saw the bedroom door open a little and heard laughter and whispering coming from inside. He became frantic and started hitting the old woman on the head with all his strength. But with each blow, the laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder, and the old woman was just shaking with laughter. He tried to run away, but the hallway was full of people, and the doors to the apartments were open.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, in a state of panic and frenzy, attacks an old woman with an axe, but is haunted by her laughter and the sounds from the bedroom."
