  "text": "“I was called here… by a notice…” Raskolnikov hesitated.  \n“For money you owe from the student,” the head clerk quickly interrupted, pulling himself away from his papers. “Here!” He threw a document at Raskolnikov and pointed to a spot on it. “Read that!”  \n“Money? What money?” Raskolnikov thought, “but… it can’t be that.”  \nHe suddenly felt a rush of joy. It was like a heavy weight was lifted off him.  \n“And what time were you told to come, sir?” shouted the assistant superintendent, looking more upset for some reason. “You were told to come at nine, and now it’s twelve!”  \n“The notice was only given to me a quarter of an hour ago,” Raskolnikov replied loudly over his shoulder. To his surprise, he felt angry too and enjoyed it a little. “And it’s enough that I came here sick with fever.”  \n“Please stop shouting!”  \n“I’m not shouting, I’m speaking quietly; you are the one shouting at me. I’m a student, and I won’t let anyone shout at me.”  \nThe assistant superintendent was so angry that he could only mumble at first. He jumped up from his chair.  \n“Be quiet! You are in a government office. Don’t be rude, sir!”  \n“You’re in a government office too,” Raskolnikov shouted back.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a mix of relief and anger during a confrontation in a government office regarding a notice he received."
