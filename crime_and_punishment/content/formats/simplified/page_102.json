His head hurt, and he walked around his small room before sinking back onto the sofa. \n\n“Going to sleep again,” Nastasya called out. “Are you sick?” \n\nHe didn’t answer. \n\n“Do you want some tea?” \n\n“Later,” he replied, closing his eyes again and turning toward the wall. \n\nNastasya stood over him. \n\n“Maybe he really is sick,” she said, then left the room. \n\nShe returned at two o'clock with soup. He was still lying down. The tea was untouched. Nastasya felt annoyed and started to wake him up angrily. \n\n“Why are you lying there like a log?” she yelled, looking at him with disgust. \n\nHe got up and sat down again but didn’t say anything and just stared at the floor. \n\n“Are you sick or not?” Nastasya asked, but got no answer again. “You should go outside for some fresh air,” she suggested after a pause. “Will you eat or not?” \n\n“Later,” he said weakly. “You can go.” \n\nHe waved her away. \n\nShe stayed a little longer, looked at him with concern, and then left. \n\nA few minutes later, he looked at the tea and soup for a long time. Then he took some bread, picked up a spoon, and started to eat. \n\nHe ate a little, just three or four spoonfuls, without any real appetite, almost like it was automatic. His head hurt less after he ate.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov struggles with illness and apathy while being cared for by Nastasya, who is concerned about his well-being."
