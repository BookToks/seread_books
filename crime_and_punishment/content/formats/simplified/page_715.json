Finally, Achilles thought it was strange for someone who wasn't drunk to just stand there staring.\n\n\"What do you want here?\" he asked, not moving.\n\n\"Nothing, brother, good morning,\" Svidrigaïlov replied.\n\n\"This isn’t the right place.\"\n\n\"I’m going to another country, brother.\"\n\n\"Another country?\"\n\n\"To America.\"\n\n\"America.\"\n\nSvidrigaïlov took out a gun and got it ready to fire. Achilles raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"Hey, this isn’t the right place for jokes!\" he said.\n\n\"Why not?\" Svidrigaïlov asked.\n\n\"Because it isn’t.\"\n\n\"Well, I don’t care. It’s a good place. When someone asks, just say he was going to America.\"\n\nHe put the gun to his head.\n\n\"You can’t do that here, it’s not the right place,\" Achilles shouted, his eyes getting wider.\n\nSvidrigaïlov pulled the trigger.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov, contemplating suicide, confronts Achilles while preparing to use a revolver."
