Good God!”  \n“I’ve only killed a louse, Sonia, a useless, disgusting, harmful thing.”  \n“A human being—a louse!”  \n“I know it wasn’t a louse,” he said, looking at her strangely. “But I’ve been talking nonsense, Sonia. I’ve been talking nonsense for a long time. You’re right; there were other reasons for it! I haven’t spoken to anyone in so long, Sonia. My head hurts so much now.”  \n\nHis eyes were bright with fever. He seemed almost out of it; a worried smile appeared on his face. His deep tiredness showed through his excitement. Sonia saw how much he was suffering. She was starting to feel dizzy too. He was talking in a strange way; it made some sense, but still… “But how, how! Good God!” And she wrung her hands in despair.  \n\n“No, Sonia, that’s not it,” he suddenly said, lifting his head as if a new thought had hit him—“that’s not it! Imagine—yes, it’s better—imagine that I am vain, jealous, mean, spiteful, and maybe a little crazy. (Let’s just say everything! They’ve already talked about madness, I noticed.) I told you I couldn’t stay at the university. But do you know that maybe I could have? My mother would have sent me money for the fees, and I could have earned enough for clothes, boots, and food.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist reflects on his mental state and the underlying causes of his turmoil, revealing his feelings of exhaustion and despair."
