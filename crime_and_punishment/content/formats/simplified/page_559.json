How could I have given her more?\"\n\n\"I saw it, I saw it,\" Lebeziatnikov repeated. \"Even though it goes against my beliefs, I’m ready to swear in court because I saw you slip it into her pocket. I thought you did it out of kindness! When you said goodbye to her at the door, you held her hand with one hand and with your other hand, you put the note in her pocket. I saw it!\"\n\nLuzhin turned pale. \n\n\"What lies!\" he shouted. \"How could you see the note from the window? You imagined it with your bad eyesight. You’re going crazy!\"\n\n\"No, I didn’t imagine it. I was standing a bit away, but I saw everything. It would be hard to see a note from the window, that’s true, but I knew it was a hundred-rouble note because when you were going to give Sofya Semyonovna ten roubles, you picked up a hundred-rouble note from the table. I saw it because I was close by, and I realized what you were doing.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Lebeziatnikov accuses Luzhin of deceitfully giving a hundred-rouble note to Sofya, contradicting Luzhin's claim of only giving her ten roubles."
