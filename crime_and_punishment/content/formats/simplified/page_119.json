  "text": "He tried to fit the big key with deep notches into the chest of drawers but remembered it couldn’t belong to it. It must belong to a strong box, and everything might be hidden in there. He left the chest of drawers and felt under the bed, knowing old women often keep boxes there. He found a good-sized box under the bed, about a yard long, with a red leather lid covered in steel nails. The notched key fit perfectly and unlocked it.\n\nInside, under a white sheet, he saw a red brocade coat lined with hareskin. Under it were a silk dress and a shawl, and it looked like there were only clothes. The first thing he did was wipe his blood-stained hands on the red brocade, thinking that the blood would be less visible on red. Then he suddenly realized how crazy that was.\n\nAs soon as he touched the clothes, a gold watch fell out from under the fur coat. He quickly turned everything over. He found various gold items among the clothes—probably things that were pawned and not picked up—like bracelets, chains, earrings, and pins. Some were in cases, while others were wrapped in newspaper and tied with tape. Without wasting time, he started stuffing his pockets with the items without looking closely at them.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist discovers a hidden box under the bed containing valuable items, prompting a frantic and desperate act of theft."
