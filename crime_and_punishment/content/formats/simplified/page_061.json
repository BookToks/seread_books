From there, Dounia and I can travel comfortably in third class. So, I might be able to send you thirty roubles instead of just twenty-five.\n\nBut I’ve already written a lot, and there’s no room for more. So much has happened! Now, my dear Rodya, I hug you and send you a mother’s blessing until we meet. Love Dounia, your sister; love her as she loves you. She loves you more than anything, even more than herself. She is an angel, and you, Rodya, are everything to us—our only hope and comfort. If you are happy, we will be happy.\n\nDo you still say your prayers, Rodya? Do you believe in the mercy of our Creator? I worry that you might have been influenced by the doubts that are around today. If that’s true, I pray for you. Remember how, when you were a child, you used to say your prayers at my knee when your father was alive? We were so happy then.\n\nGoodbye until we meet. I hug you tightly with many kisses.\n\nYours till death,\nPULCHERIA RASKOLNIKOV.\n\nAs Raskolnikov read the letter, his face was wet with tears.
