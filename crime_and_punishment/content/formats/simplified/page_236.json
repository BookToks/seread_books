  "text": "\"Can’t stand that?\" \n\n\"Could you handle it? I couldn’t. For a hundred roubles, would you risk such a scary situation? Going into a bank with fake money, where they look for that kind of thing? No, I wouldn’t have the guts to do it. Would you?\"\n\nRaskolnikov really wanted to stick his tongue out. He felt shivers down his back.\n\n\"I would do it differently,\" Raskolnikov said. \"Here’s how I’d change the money: I’d count the first thousand notes several times, checking each one. Then I’d start on the second thousand, count halfway, and hold a fifty-rouble note up to the light to see if it was real. I’d say, ‘A relative of mine lost twenty-five roubles with a fake note,’ and tell them the whole story. Then, when I got to the third thousand, I’d say, ‘Wait, I think I made a mistake in the seventh hundred of the second thousand. I’m not sure.’ So, I’d go back to the second thousand and keep doing that until I was done. After I finished, I’d take one from the fifth and one from the second thousand, check them again, and ask, ‘Can you change these, please?’ I’d make the clerk so nervous that he wouldn’t know how to get rid of me. When I was done and left, I’d come back and say, ‘Excuse me, I need some help with something.’ That’s how I’d do it.\"\n\n\"Wow! That’s really crazy stuff you’re saying!\" said Zametov, laughing.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov discusses a meticulous and deceptive method for exchanging counterfeit money, revealing his complex thoughts on crime."
