Besides, it’s getting late—oh no, it’s past ten!’ she said, looking at a beautiful gold watch hanging around her neck on a thin chain. ‘It was a gift from her fiancé,’ thought Razumihin.\n\n‘We need to go, Dounia, we need to go,’ her mother said, getting anxious. ‘He might think we’re still upset from yesterday since we’re coming so late. Oh my goodness!’\n\nAs she spoke, she hurried to put on her hat and coat. Dounia also got ready. Razumihin noticed that her gloves were not just old but had holes in them. Still, this clear sign of their struggle gave the two women a special dignity, which often happens with people who wear worn-out clothes with pride. Razumihin looked at Dounia with admiration and felt proud to be with her. ‘The queen who mended her stockings in prison,’ he thought, ‘must have looked like a queen even more than at fancy parties.’\n\n‘My God!’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna said, ‘I never thought I would be afraid to see my son, my dear Rodya! I’m scared, Dmitri Prokofitch,’ she added, looking at him nervously.\n\n‘Don’t be scared, mother,’ Dounia said, giving her a kiss. ‘You should trust him.’\n\n‘Oh dear, I do trust him, but I didn’t sleep at all last night,’ the poor woman cried.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Dounia are anxious about visiting Rodya, fearing his reaction and their strained relationship."
