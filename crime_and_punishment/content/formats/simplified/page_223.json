He doesn’t care about anything except one thing—he seems really worked up about the murder?”\n\n“Yeah, I saw that too. He’s interested and scared. He fainted the day he was sick at the police station.”\n\n“Tell me more about that later, and I’ll share something too. He really interests me! I’ll go see him again in half an hour. There shouldn’t be any inflammation.”\n\n“Thanks! I’ll wait with Pashenka and keep an eye on him through Nastasya…”\n\nLeft alone, Raskolnikov looked at Nastasya with impatience and sadness, but she stayed a little longer.\n\n“Do you want some tea now?” she asked.\n\n“Later!
