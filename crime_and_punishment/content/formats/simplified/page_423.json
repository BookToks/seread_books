When I was there, he treated the servants well, and they actually liked him, even though they blamed him for Philip's death.\"\n\n\"I see, Avdotya Romanovna, that you suddenly want to defend him,\" Luzhin said with a twisted smile. \"He is definitely clever and good at getting on the ladies' good side, like Marfa Petrovna, who died in such a strange way. My only wish has been to help you and your mother with my advice, especially since we can expect more trouble from him. I truly believe he will end up in debtor's prison again. Marfa Petrovna had no plans to give him anything significant, considering his children's needs. If she left him anything, it would just be a small amount that wouldn't last a year for someone like him.\"\n\n\"Pyotr Petrovitch, please,\" Dounia said, \"don't talk about Mr. Svidrigaïlov anymore. It makes me unhappy.\"\n\n\"He just visited me,\" Raskolnikov said, finally speaking up.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia expresses her discomfort with discussions about Mr. Svidrigaïlov, highlighting the negative impact he has on her."
