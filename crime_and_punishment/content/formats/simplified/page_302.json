  "text": "\"Crime and Punishment\"\n\n\"How can a doctor help patients if he can't control them? Do you know if he will go to them or if they are coming here?\" \n\n\"I think they are coming,\" said Razumihin, understanding the question. \"They will probably talk about family stuff. I’ll leave. You, as the doctor, have more right to be here than I do.\"\n\n\"But I’m not a priest. I’ll come and go; I have a lot to do besides taking care of them.\"\n\n\"One thing worries me,\" Razumihin said with a frown. \"On the way home, I said a lot of silly things to him... all kinds of stuff... including that you were worried he might go insane.\"\n\n\"You told the ladies that too.\"\n\n\"I know it was dumb! You can scold me if you want! Did you really think it was serious?\"\n\n\"That's nonsense! How could I take it seriously? You called him a monomaniac when you brought me to him... and we made things worse yesterday with your story about the painter. It was a bad conversation when he was probably already upset about that! If I had known what happened at the police station and that someone had insulted him with that suspicion, I wouldn’t have let that talk happen. These monomaniacs can blow things out of proportion and see their worries as real. As far as I remember, it was Zametov’s story that cleared up part of the mystery for me. I know of a case where a hypochondriac, a man of forty, cut himself.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin expresses concern about a friend's mental state, reflecting on the impact of their previous conversations and the potential for misunderstanding."
