  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nEveryone thought they were right and felt sad when they looked at each other. They beat their chests, cried, and felt helpless. They couldn't agree on what was good or evil, and they didn't know who to blame or defend. People fought each other out of pointless anger. Armies formed to fight, but even while marching, they would start attacking one another. Soldiers would break ranks and hurt each other, stabbing and biting.\n\nThe alarm bells rang all day in the towns. People rushed together, but no one knew why or who called them. Regular jobs were left undone because everyone had their own ideas and couldnâ€™t agree. The land was also neglected. Groups of men would meet, agree on something, and then quickly start doing something completely different. They accused each other, fought, and killed. There were fires and hunger everywhere. Everything and everyone faced destruction. The plague spread and grew worse. Only a few people could be saved in the whole world. They were special and meant to create a new race and a new life, to renew the earth, but no one had seen or heard them.\n\nRaskolnikov was troubled that this pointless dream kept bothering him so much. The memory of this feverish state stayed with him for a long time.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The chaotic and destructive nature of humanity is depicted through senseless violence and the inability to agree on moral truths."
