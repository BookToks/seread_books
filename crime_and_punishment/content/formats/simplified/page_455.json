Put some away for a tough time?\" he asked, stopping in front of her. \n\n\"No,\" Sonia whispered. \n\n\"Of course not. Have you even tried?\" he said almost mockingly. \n\n\"Yes.\" \n\n\"And it didn't work! No need to ask that.\" He started pacing the room again. \n\n\"Don't you get money every day?\" \n\nSonia looked more confused, and her face turned red. \n\n\"No,\" she whispered, struggling to speak. \n\n\"It will be the same with Polenka, I'm sure,\" he said suddenly. \n\n\"No, no! It can't be! No!\" Sonia cried out in despair, as if she had been hurt. \"God wouldn't allow something so terrible!\" \n\n\"He lets other people go through it.\" \n\n\"No, no! God will protect her, God!\" she kept repeating, almost losing it. \n\n\"But maybe there is no God at all,\" Raskolnikov replied with a cruel smile, looking at her. \n\nSonia's face changed suddenly; she looked at him with deep disappointment. She tried to say something but couldn't and started crying hard, hiding her face in her hands.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia expresses her despair over the possibility of losing her loved ones, clinging to her faith in God's protection despite Raskolnikov's cynicism."
