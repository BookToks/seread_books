  "text": "All stepped back. The confession didn't take long. The dying man probably didn't understand much; he could only make weak, broken sounds. Katerina Ivanovna picked up little Lida, lifted the boy from the chair, knelt by the stove, and made the children kneel in front of her. The little girl was still shaking, but the boy, kneeling on his bare knees, moved his hand in a rhythm, crossing himself carefully and bowing down to touch the floor with his forehead. This seemed to make him very happy. Katerina Ivanovna bit her lips and held back her tears. She prayed, sometimes fixing the boy’s shirt and covering the girl's bare shoulders with a kerchief she took from the chest without getting up or stopping her prayers. Meanwhile, the door from the inner rooms opened again, and more people from the other flats crowded into the hallway, but they didn't come inside. A single candle lit up the scene.\n\nAt that moment, Polenka pushed her way through the crowd at the door. She came in, out of breath from running, took off her kerchief, looked for her mother, went up to her, and said, “She’s coming, I met her in the street.” Her mother made her kneel beside her.\n\nA young girl quietly made her way through the crowd. It was strange to see her in that room filled with poverty, rags, death, and sadness. She was also in rags, wearing very cheap clothes, but she had some flashy decorations that stood out.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna and her children kneel in prayer amidst a scene of despair and impending death, while a crowd gathers outside."
