He was poor and helpless, and he wanted to use the three thousand roubles he thought he would find to help himself get started in life. His weak and cowardly nature, made worse by his struggles and failures, led him to commit the crime. When asked why he confessed, he said it was because he felt very sorry for what he did. \n\nThe punishment he received was more lenient than expected, maybe because he didn’t try to defend himself and instead showed he felt guilty. They considered all the strange details of the crime. It was clear that he was in a terrible and poor state when he did it. The fact that he didn’t use what he stole was seen as a sign of his guilt and his troubled mind at that time. \n\nAlso, the murder of Lizaveta supported the idea that he was not thinking straight; he committed two murders and forgot to close the door! Finally, his confession came at a time when the case was confused by false evidence from Nikolay, and there was no real proof against him. All of this helped reduce his punishment. Other unexpected facts also came to light that worked in his favor.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confessed to murder driven by poverty and remorse, which influenced the leniency of his sentence."
