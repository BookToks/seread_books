He concluded silently, “He must be a political conspirator! He’s about to do something desperate. Dounia must know about it.” \n\n“So, Avdotya Romanovna came to see you,” he said carefully, “and you’re going to see a man who says we need more air. That letter must be connected to this too.” \n\n“What letter?” \n\n“She got a letter today. It really upset her—too much. I started talking about you, and she asked me to stop. Then she said we might have to part soon, and she thanked me for something. After that, she went to her room and locked the door.” \n\n“She got a letter?” Raskolnikov asked, thinking. \n\n“Yes, and you didn’t know? Hmm…” \n\nThey both fell silent. \n\n“Goodbye, Rodion. There was a time when I… Never mind, goodbye. There was a time… Well, goodbye! I have to go too. I’m not going to drink. There’s no need for that now… That’s all nonsense!” \n\nHe rushed out, but just as he was closing the door…\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin suspects that Raskolnikov is involved in a political conspiracy and is troubled by a letter that has upset Dounia."
