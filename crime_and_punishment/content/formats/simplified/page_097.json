  "text": "He had three red stones, a gift from his sister when they parted. He decided to take the ring. When he first saw the old woman, he felt a strong dislike for her, even though he didn’t know anything special about her. He got two roubles from her and went into a small, sad tavern on his way home. He ordered tea, sat down, and started thinking deeply. A strange idea was bothering him, like a chick trying to break out of an egg.\n\nAt the next table, there was a student he didn’t know and a young officer. They had just played billiards and were drinking tea. Suddenly, he heard the student mention the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna and give her address. This surprised Raskolnikov because he had just come from her, and now he heard her name again. It felt strange, like someone was talking about her just for him. The student started sharing details about Alyona Ivanovna.\n\n“She’s great,” he said. “You can always get money from her. She’s very rich and can give you five thousand roubles at once, but she’ll also take something for just one rouble. Many of our friends have dealt with her. But she’s a terrible old woman….” He went on to explain how mean and unpredictable she was, how if you were even a day late with your payment, you would lose your item. He described how she gave only a quarter of the item's value and charged five to seven percent interest each month.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels a strange connection to the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna after overhearing a conversation about her at a tavern."
