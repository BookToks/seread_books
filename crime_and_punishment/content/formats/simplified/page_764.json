  "text": "Raskolnikov came out of the shed and sat on some logs by the riverbank. He looked at the wide, empty river. From the high bank, he could see a big view, and he could faintly hear singing from the other side. In the sunny steppe, he could see tiny black dots that were the nomads’ tents. There was freedom there, and people living very differently from those around him. It felt like time had stopped, as if the days of Abraham and his flocks were still here. \n\nRaskolnikov sat there, lost in thought and daydreams. He didn’t think of anything specific, but he felt a strange restlessness. Suddenly, Sonia appeared beside him. She had come quietly and sat down next to him. It was still early, and the morning air was chilly. She wore her old cloak and a green shawl; her face looked sickly and was thinner and paler. She smiled at him happily but reached out her hand shyly. \n\nShe was always nervous about reaching out to him, sometimes not doing it at all, as if she was afraid he would push her away. He usually took her hand reluctantly and often seemed annoyed to see her, sometimes staying silent during her visits. Sometimes, she was so nervous she would leave feeling very sad. But this time, they held hands without letting go. He quickly glanced at her and then looked down at the ground without saying anything. They were alone, and no one had noticed them. The guard had turned away for a moment.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reflects on freedom and his troubled thoughts while sitting by the river, and is joined by Sonia, whose presence brings a mix of joy and tension."
