She cried as she told them how he came to say goodbye, suggesting she knew many important things, and that Rodya had powerful enemies, so he needed to hide. She believed his future would be bright once these bad influences were gone. She told Razumihin that her son would become a great leader, and his article and talent showed it. She read his article a lot, even out loud, and almost took it to bed with her. Yet, she hardly asked where Rodya was, even though others avoided the topic, which could have made her suspicious.\n\nThey started to worry about Pulcheria Alexandrovna's strange silence on some topics. For example, she didnâ€™t complain about not getting letters from him, even though in the past she had lived for his letters. This made Dounia very uneasy. She thought her mother might suspect something terrible about Rodya and was scared to ask, fearing the answer would be worse. Dounia could see that her mother was not completely in control of her mind.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pulcheria Alexandrovna remains blissfully unaware of her son Rodya's true circumstances, believing in his future success while avoiding the topic of his absence."
