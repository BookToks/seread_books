He could hear someone dancing wildly, keeping time with their heels to the sound of a guitar and a high voice singing a lively song. He listened closely, feeling a mix of sadness and daydreaming, leaning down to peek inside from the sidewalk.\n\n“Oh, my handsome soldier, don’t hit me for no reason,” sang the high voice. Raskolnikov really wanted to understand the song, as if it was really important.\n\n“Should I go in?” he wondered. “They’re laughing. Should I drink?” \n\n“Won’t you come in?” one of the women called to him. Her voice was sweet and clearer than the others. She was young and not unattractive—she was the only nice-looking one in the group. \n\n“Wow, she’s pretty,” he thought, standing up straight and looking at her. \n\nShe smiled, happy with the compliment. “You’re good-looking too,” she said. \n\n“Isn’t he too skinny?” another woman said in a deep voice. “Did you just leave the hospital?” \n\n“They all act like they’re rich, but they have funny noses,” said a tipsy peasant with a sly grin, wearing a loose coat. “Look how happy they are.” \n\n“Get out of here!” \n\n“I’ll go, sweetheart!” he said, rushing down into the bar below. Raskolnikov\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is drawn to the lively atmosphere of a saloon, contemplating whether to join in the revelry."
