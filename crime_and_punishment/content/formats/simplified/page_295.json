  "text": "Zossimov smiled and said that the patient probably had a strong idea in his mind, almost like a single obsession. He was studying this area of medicine, but he reminded everyone that until today, the patient had been very confused. He believed that having family around would help the patient get better and keep his mind busy, as long as nothing too shocking happened. After that, he stood up, said goodbye with a polite bow, and received many thanks and blessings. Avdotya Romanovna even offered her hand to him. He left feeling very happy about his visit and himself.\n\n“Let’s talk tomorrow; go to bed now!” Razumihin said as he followed Zossimov out. “I’ll come by in the morning with my report.”\n\n“That girl, Avdotya Romanovna, is pretty,” Zossimov said, almost licking his lips as they stepped outside.\n\n“Pretty? You called her pretty?” Razumihin shouted, grabbing Zossimov by the throat. “If you ever dare… Do you understand? Do you get it?” he yelled, shaking him against the wall.\n\n“Let me go, you drunk,” Zossimov replied, trying to break free. Once Razumihin let him go, Zossimov burst out laughing. Razumihin stood there, serious and deep in thought.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Zossimov visits Raskolnikov's family, expressing optimism about the patient's recovery while Razumihin reacts violently to Zossimov's comments about Avdotya."
