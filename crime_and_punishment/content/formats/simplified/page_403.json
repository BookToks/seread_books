Eight years ago, I was part of a group of well-off men; we had a great time. They were all well-mannered, you know, poets and rich people. In Russian society, the best manners often come from those who’ve been through tough times, haven’t you noticed? I’ve gotten worse since living in the country. I ended up in prison for debt because of a shady guy from Nezhin. Then Marfa Petrovna came; she negotiated with him and paid thirty thousand silver pieces to get me out (I owed seventy thousand). We got married, and she took me to the country like I was a prize. She was five years older than me and really cared for me. I stayed in the country for seven years. And, remember, she always had a document over me, an IOU for thirty thousand roubles, so if I ever acted up, she could trap me! And she would have done it! Women don’t see anything wrong with that.’\n\n‘If it weren’t for that, would you have left her?’\n\n‘I’m not sure. It wasn’t just the document that kept me there. I didn’t want to go anywhere else. Marfa Petrovna even suggested I travel abroad since I was bored, but I’ve been abroad before and always felt sick there. I can’t explain why, but even with the beautiful sunrise and the Bay of Naples, it just didn’t feel right.’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov reflects on his past experiences and relationships, revealing his complex feelings about society and personal freedom."
