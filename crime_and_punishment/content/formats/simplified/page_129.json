He waited, then quietly stepped out and ran down the stairs.\n\nNo one was on the stairs or in the doorway. He quickly went through the doorway and turned left on the street.\n\nHe knew very well that they were at the flat right then, surprised to find it unlocked since he had just locked the door. He imagined they were looking at the bodies and, in a minute, they would figure out that the murderer had just been there and managed to hide and escape. They would probably guess he had been in the empty flat while they were going upstairs. Meanwhile, he didn't dare to walk faster, even though the next turn was still almost a hundred yards away. “Should he slip into some doorway and wait in an unknown street? No, that wouldn’t work! Should he throw away the axe? Should he take a cab? No way, no way!”\n\nFinally, he reached the turn. He turned down it, feeling weak. He was halfway to safety and he knew it; it was less risky because there were a lot of people, and he felt lost in the crowd like a grain of sand. But everything he had gone through had made him so weak that he could barely move.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov narrowly escapes detection after committing a murder, feeling both exhausted and anxious about his fate."
