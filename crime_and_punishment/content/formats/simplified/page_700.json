It was Katerina Ivanovna’s debt, not yours, so you shouldn’t have paid attention to the German woman. You can’t get by in life like that. \n\nIf anyone asks about me tomorrow or the day after, don’t mention my visit and don’t show the money or talk about it. Well, goodbye. (He stood up.) “Say hi to Rodion Romanovitch for me. You should keep the money with Mr. Razumihin for now. You know him, right? He’s a good guy. Take it to him tomorrow or when you can. Until then, hide it well.”\n\nSonia jumped up from her chair and looked at Svidrigaïlov in worry.

Make sure you do.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov advises Sonia to keep money safe for her betrothed and to be discreet about their interactions."
