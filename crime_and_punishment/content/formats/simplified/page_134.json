That I’m drunk but…’ \n\nHe rushed to the window. There was enough light, so he quickly checked himself from head to toe, looking over all his clothes for any signs. But he couldn’t do it that way; shivering from the cold, he started taking everything off to check again. He looked through everything carefully, even the smallest pieces, and checked three times because he didn’t trust himself. \n\nBut there seemed to be nothing, except in one spot where some thick drops of dried blood were stuck to the frayed edge of his pants. He picked up a big knife and cut off the frayed threads. There didn’t seem to be anything else. \n\nSuddenly, he remembered that the purse and the things he had taken from the old woman’s box were still in his pockets! He hadn’t thought about taking them out and hiding them! He hadn’t even remembered them while checking his clothes! What now? He quickly took them out and threw them on the table. After pulling everything out and turning his pocket inside out to make sure nothing was left, he took the whole pile to the corner. The paper at the bottom of the wall had come off and was hanging in tatters. He started stuffing everything into the hole behind the paper: ‘They’re in! All out of sight, and the purse too!’ he thought happily, standing up.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist frantically searches for traces of his crime and hides the stolen items in a wall cavity."
