  "text": "A thick crowd of peasants was gathered. He pushed his way into the middle of it, looking at their faces. He felt a strange urge to talk to them. But the peasants ignored him; they were all shouting in groups. He stood there for a moment, then turned right towards V.\n\nHe had often walked down that little street that leads from the market to Sadovy Street. Recently, he had felt drawn to wander around this area when he was feeling down, which often made him feel even worse.\n\nNow he walked along without thinking about anything. There was a big block of buildings filled with bars and places to eat. Women were constantly running in and out, wearing indoor clothes and no head coverings. They gathered in groups on the sidewalk, especially near the entrances to the lively places below. From one of these places, loud noises, singing, guitar music, and shouts of laughter spilled out onto the street. A crowd of women was gathered at the door; some sat on the steps, others stood talking on the pavement. A drunken soldier, smoking a cigarette, walked by them in the street, swearing; he seemed lost. One beggar was arguing with another, and a man who was very drunk was lying across the road. Raskolnikov joined the group of women, who were speaking in low voices. They had no head coverings and wore cotton dresses and goatskin shoes. Some women were in their forties, while others were only seventeen.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov wanders through a lively district filled with peasants and women, feeling a mix of depression and curiosity."
