  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nYou should act nicely so everyone knows you come from a good family. I told you the dress should be longer and made of two pieces. It was your fault, Sonia, for saying to make it shorter. Now the child looks deformed because of it. Why are you all crying again? What’s wrong with you? Come on, Kolya, start. Hurry up! Oh, what a difficult child!\n\n\"Five coins, five coins.\"\n\n\"Another policeman! What do you want?\"\n\nA policeman was pushing through the crowd. But then, a man in a civilian coat, looking solid and about fifty years old, came up. He had a medal on his neck, which made Katerina Ivanovna happy and impressed the policeman. Without saying anything, he handed her a green three-rouble note. He looked genuinely kind. Katerina Ivanovna took it and bowed politely.\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" she said proudly. \"The reasons we are here (take the money, Polenka: see, there are kind people who want to help a poor woman in trouble). You see, these orphans come from a good family—I could even say an aristocratic family—and that terrible general was eating grouse… and got mad at me for bothering him. 'Your excellency,' I said, 'please help the orphans, since you knew my late husband, Semyon Zaharovitch, and on the day he died, a horrible person slandered his only daughter.' … That policeman again! Help me,\" she cried to the official. \"Why is that policeman getting closer to me? We just ran into trouble.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna pleads for help and sympathy from a gentleman while facing trouble with a policeman during a public performance."
