Are you always home alone? Is your sister not here with you?” he asked casually as he stepped into the hallway. \n\n“What’s it to you, sir?” she shot back. \n\n“Oh, nothing special, I was just asking. You’re too quick to judge… Have a good day, Alyona Ivanovna.” \n\nRaskolnikov left feeling very confused. His confusion grew as he went down the stairs. He even stopped a few times, as if struck by a sudden thought. Once outside, he shouted, “Oh, God, this is all so awful! Can I really… No, that’s nonsense, it’s ridiculous!” he said firmly. “How could I think of such a terrible thing? My heart is capable of such dirty thoughts. Yes, it’s disgusting, really disgusting!—and for a whole month I’ve been…” But he couldn’t find the words to express how upset he felt. The strong feeling of disgust that had started to weigh on him while he was going to see the old woman had grown so much that he didn’t know how to escape his misery. He walked down the street like a drunk person, not caring about the people around him, bumping into them.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences intense confusion and repulsion after visiting Alyona Ivanovna, reflecting on the disturbing thoughts that have plagued him."
