But I wonder, will I become so humble in fifteen or twenty years that I will bow down to people and cry about being a criminal? Yes, that’s it, that’s what they want. Look at them running around the streets, every one of them a bad person at heart and, even worse, a fool. But if I try to get away with it, they would be furious. Oh, how I hate them all!”\n\nHe started to think about how he could be made to feel small before all of them, without exception—made small by being found guilty. And yet, why not? It must be so. Wouldn’t twenty years of being trapped break him completely? Water can wear down stone. And why should he live after that? Why should he go now when he knew it would be like this?
