If Porfiry had any proof, it had to be about him.\n\nHe sat on the sofa, elbows on his knees, and hid his face in his hands. He was still shaking with nerves. Finally, he got up, grabbed his cap, thought for a moment, and went to the door.\n\nHe felt like he might be safe for today. Suddenly, he felt almost happy. He wanted to hurry to Katerina Ivanovna’s place. He knew he would be late for the funeral, but he could still make it to the memorial dinner, and he would see Sonia there.\n\nHe paused, thought for a moment, and a pained smile appeared on his face. \"Today! Today,\" he repeated to himself. \"Yes, today! It has to be….\"\n\nJust as he was about to open the door, it started to open by itself. He jumped back. The door opened slowly, and suddenly, the visitor from yesterday appeared in the doorway.\n\nThe man stood there, looking at Raskolnikov without saying anything, and stepped into the room. He looked exactly the same as yesterday, but his face showed a big change; he looked sad and sighed deeply.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a fleeting sense of relief and anticipation before being confronted by a mysterious visitor from the previous day."
