  "text": "Lizaveta knew a bit about Raskolnikov, and he knew about her. She was a single woman around thirty-five, tall, awkward, shy, and not very smart. She was like a servant and was always scared of her sister, who made her work all the time and even hit her.\n\nLizaveta was standing with a bundle, listening carefully to a huckster and his wife. They were talking about something important. When Raskolnikov saw her, he felt a strange surprise, even though there was nothing surprising about seeing her.\n\n\"You can decide for yourself, Lizaveta Ivanovna,\" the huckster said. \"Come by tomorrow at seven. They will be here too.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow?\" Lizaveta said slowly, as if she couldn't decide.\n\n\"You look so scared of Alyona Ivanovna,\" the huckster’s wife said, a cheerful little woman. \"You seem like a little child. And she’s not even your real sister—just a step-sister. Look how she treats you!\"\n\n\"But don’t mention this to Alyona Ivanovna,\" her husband added. \"That’s my advice. Just come to us without asking. It will be worth it. Your sister might have an idea later.\"\n\n\"Am I supposed to come?\" Lizaveta asked.\n\n\"Yes, at seven o’clock tomorrow. They will be here. You can decide for yourself then.\"\n\n\"And we’ll have some tea,\" his wife added.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Lizaveta, a timid and submissive woman, is encouraged by a huckster and his wife to visit them the next day, hinting at her troubled relationship with her domineering sister, Alyona."
