  "text": "Raskolnikov was listening to Ilya Petrovitch, who had obviously been drinking. Ilya was talking a lot, but Raskolnikov didn’t really understand most of it. He raised his eyebrows, curious about where the conversation was going.\n\nIlya continued, joking about the young women studying to be midwives. He thought it was funny to call them that. He asked if he should trust a young lady to treat him if he got sick. He laughed, pleased with his joke. Ilya thought people were too eager to get educated, but once they were educated, they should stop showing off. He wondered why someone like Zametov would insult him. \n\nThen Ilya started talking about how common suicides were. He mentioned that people were spending their last money and then killing themselves, including young people and old people. Just that morning, they heard about a man who had come to town and had killed himself. \n\nSomeone from another room answered Ilya’s question about the man’s name, saying it was Svidrigaïlov. \n\nRaskolnikov was shocked. He exclaimed, “Svidrigaïlov! Svidrigaïlov has shot himself!” Ilya asked if Raskolnikov knew Svidrigaïlov.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is startled to learn about Svidrigaïlov's suicide, indicating a connection or concern for the man."
