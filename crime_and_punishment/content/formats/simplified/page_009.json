  "text": "A look of deep disgust appeared on the young man’s face for a moment. He was very good-looking, tall, slim, and had beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon, he fell into deep thought, or more accurately, his mind went blank. He walked without noticing what was around him and didn’t care to notice it either. Sometimes, he would mumble to himself, a habit he had just admitted to. At those times, he realized that his thoughts were tangled and that he felt very weak; he had hardly eaten for two days.\n\nHe was dressed so poorly that even someone used to shabby clothes would feel embarrassed to be seen in such rags. However, in that part of town, no one would be surprised by bad clothing. Because the Hay Market was nearby and there were many places of ill-repute, along with a lot of working-class people, all sorts of characters were seen in the streets. No one would be shocked by any odd appearance. But the young man felt so much bitterness and contempt inside that, despite being picky about looks, he cared the least about his rags while walking in the street. It was different when he ran into acquaintances or former classmates, whom he really didn’t like meeting. Yet, when a drunk man was being taken somewhere in a big wagon, it caught his attention.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The young man, despite his handsome appearance, is consumed by disgust and bitterness, feeling weak and ashamed in his ragged clothing as he navigates the streets of Petersburg."
