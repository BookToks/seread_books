What will happen now?” \n\n“I don’t know,” Sonia said sadly.\n\n“Will they stay there?” \n\n“I don’t know. They owe money for where they live, but I heard the landlady wants to get rid of them. Katerina Ivanovna says she won’t stay there another minute.”\n\n“How can she be so bold? Does she count on you?”\n\n“Oh, please don’t say that. We are one; we live as one.” Sonia was upset and even angry, like a little bird. “What could she do? What could she do?” she said, getting worked up. “And she cried so much today! Haven’t you noticed she’s not thinking straight? One minute she worries like a child about how everything will be okay tomorrow, the lunch and all that. Then she’s crying, spitting blood, and suddenly she starts banging her head against the wall in despair. But then she calms down. She puts all her hopes in you; she believes you will help her and that she will find a little money and go back to her hometown.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia expresses deep concern for Katerina Ivanovna's unstable state and reliance on others for support amidst their struggles."
