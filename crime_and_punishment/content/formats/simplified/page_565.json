  "text": "Luzhin called me to the window and asked me quietly if I had seen you among Katerina Ivanovna’s guests. He really wanted you to be here! That’s it, that’s it! \n\nLuzhin smiled in a mean way and didn’t say anything. But he looked very pale. He seemed to be thinking of a way to escape. He might have wanted to leave everything behind and get away, but right now that was hard to do. It would mean admitting that the accusations against him were true. Also, the people around him, who were already drunk, were too worked up to let him go. The clerk, even though he didn’t understand everything, was shouting louder than anyone and making nasty suggestions to Luzhin. \n\nNot everyone there was drunk; some lodgers came in from other rooms. The three Poles were really excited and kept shouting at him: “The pan is a lajdak!” and muttering threats in Polish. Sonia was listening closely, but she seemed confused, like she had just come back to reality. She didn’t take her eyes off Raskolnikov, feeling that he was her only safety. Katerina Ivanovna was breathing heavily and looked very tired. Amalia Ivanovna stood there looking more confused than anyone, with her mouth open, trying to understand what had happened. All she saw was that Pyotr Petrovitch was in trouble.\n\nRaskolnikov tried to speak again, but they wouldn’t let him. Everyone was crowding around Luzhin, shouting threats and insults.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Luzhin, cornered and pale, faces accusations and hostility from the crowd, while Raskolnikov struggles to intervene."
