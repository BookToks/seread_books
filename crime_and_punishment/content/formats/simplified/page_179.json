I don’t ask her to, but I don’t mind. And here comes Nastasya with the tea. She’s quick. Nastasya, dear, do you want some beer?”  \n“Stop joking!”  \n“How about a cup of tea, then?”  \n“Maybe a cup of tea.”  \n“Pour it out. No, wait, I’ll pour it myself. Sit down.”  \n\nHe poured two cups, left his dinner, and sat back on the sofa. As before, he put his left arm around the sick man’s head, lifted him up, and gave him tea in spoonfuls, blowing on each spoonful carefully, as if this was the best way to help his friend get better. Raskolnikov didn’t say anything or push him away, even though he felt strong enough to sit up on the sofa without help and could have held a cup or a spoon, or even walked around. But for some strange reason, he decided to hide his strength and pretend he wasn’t fully okay, so he could listen to what was happening. Still, he couldn’t shake off his dislike for the situation. After drinking a dozen spoonfuls of tea, he suddenly let go of the sick man’s head, pushed the spoon away playfully, and sank back onto the pillow. He noticed there were real pillows under his head now, soft pillows in clean cases, and he made a note of that too. “Pashenka must give us some raspberry jam today.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, while pretending to be weak, observes his surroundings and the care provided by his friend Razumihin."
