But where are you going?”  \n“Good-bye, mother.”  \n“What, today?” she cried, as if she was losing him forever.  \n“I can’t stay, I must go now…”  \n“Can’t I come with you?”  \n“No, but kneel down and pray to God for me. Your prayer might reach Him.”  \n“Let me bless you and make the sign of the cross on you. That’s right, that’s right. Oh, God, what are we doing?”  \n\nYes, he was glad, very glad that there was no one else there, that he was alone with his mother. For the first time in those terrible months, his heart felt soft. He fell down before her, kissed her feet, and they both cried, hugging each other. She wasn’t surprised and didn’t ask him anything this time. For days, she had felt that something terrible was happening to her son, and now it seemed like a horrible moment had come for him.  \n\n“Rodya, my darling, my firstborn,” she said, sobbing, “now you are just like when you were little. You would run to me, hug me, and kiss me. When your father was alive and we were poor, you made us feel better just by being with us. When I buried your father, we often cried together at his grave and hugged, just like now. If I’ve been crying lately, it’s because my mother’s heart felt something bad was coming. The first time I saw you, that evening when we arrived here, I could tell just from your eyes. My heart sank right away, and today when I opened the door and looked at you, I thought the worst moment had come.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov shares an emotional farewell with his mother, expressing love and a sense of impending trouble."
