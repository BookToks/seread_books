  "text": "Raskolnikov's friend, Porfiry, noticed he was unwell and rushed to get him some water. \n\n“Come on, drink a little,” he said, bringing the decanter to him. Porfiry seemed genuinely worried, which made Raskolnikov curious, but he didn’t take the water. \n\n“Rodion, you’re going to drive yourself crazy! Please drink some water,” Porfiry urged. He made Raskolnikov take a glass, but Raskolnikov just put it back on the table, feeling disgusted. \n\n“You’ve had a bit of a scare! You need to take care of yourself!” Porfiry said, still looking worried. “Dmitri was here yesterday after you visited. I was so frustrated with his talking! Did he come from you?” \n\n“No, he didn’t come from me, but I knew he was going to see you,” Raskolnikov replied sharply. \n\n“You knew?” Porfiry asked. \n\n“I knew. So what?” \n\n“Well, Rodion, I know more than that about you. I know everything.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry expresses concern for Raskolnikov's health while revealing his awareness of Raskolnikov's situation and the suspicions surrounding him."
