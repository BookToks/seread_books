Do you think they wouldn’t? You are wrong; I will get in! You thought she would be quiet and accept this! But I am not so easy to control, let me tell you! You have gone too far. Search her, search her!”\n\nKaterina Ivanovna, in a rage, shook Luzhin and pulled him towards Sonia. \n\n“I am ready to take responsibility… but calm down, madam, calm down. I see you are not so easy to control! … Well, about that…” Luzhin mumbled, “that should be handled by the police… though there are enough witnesses already… I am ready… but it’s hard for a man… because she is a woman… But with Amalia Ivanovna’s help… though, of course, this isn’t the right way to do things… How should we do this?”\n\n“As you wish! Let anyone who wants search her!” shouted Katerina Ivanovna. “Sonia, empty your pockets! Look! See, monster, this pocket is empty; here’s her handkerchief! Here’s the other pocket, look! Do you see, do you see?”\n\nKaterina Ivanovna turned—actually, she yanked—both pockets inside out. But from the right pocket, a piece of paper flew out and fell at Luzhin’s feet. Everyone saw it, and several people shouted. Pyotr Petrovitch bent down, picked up the paper with two fingers, held it up for everyone to see, and opened it. It was a hundred-rouble note folded into eight. Pyotr Petrovitch held it up.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna confronts Luzhin, accusing him of wrongdoing and demanding that Sonia's innocence be proven by searching her pockets."
