  "text": "A man was trying to help three orphans find good homes. He mentioned that the money he had given them made it easier to place them because it's better to help orphans with some money than those with nothing. He also talked about Sonia and promised to visit Raskolnikov soon to discuss some important things.\n\nThis conversation happened in a hallway on the stairs. Svidrigaïlov looked closely at Raskolnikov and then asked quietly, \"What's wrong, Rodion? You don’t seem like yourself. You look and listen, but you don’t seem to understand. Don’t worry! We’ll talk soon. I just have a lot to do.\" He suddenly added, \"What everyone needs is fresh air, more than anything!\"\n\nHe stepped aside for the priest and server who were coming up the stairs for a memorial service. Svidrigaïlov made sure it happened twice a day. After he left, Raskolnikov paused for a moment, thought about it, and then followed the priest into Sonia’s room. He stood at the door as they began to sing the service slowly and sadly. Since childhood, he had found the idea of death to be heavy and frightening, and he hadn’t heard this service in a long time. There was something else here that felt very disturbing. He looked at the children, who were all kneeling by the coffin.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov discusses the placement of orphans and expresses concern for Raskolnikov's well-being while preparing for a requiem service."
