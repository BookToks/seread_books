  "text": "Raskolnikov joked about how new clothes made him think of helping someone. \n\n“Are you really that good at hiding your feelings?” he asked casually. \n\n“You wouldn’t have guessed, right? Just wait, I’ll help you too. Ha-ha! But seriously, all these questions about crime and kids remind me of an article you wrote that I found interesting. It was called ‘On Crime’ or something like that. I enjoyed reading it two months ago in the Periodical Review.”\n\n“My article? In the Periodical Review?” Raskolnikov replied, surprised. “I did write an article about a book six months ago after I left university, but I sent it to the Weekly Review.”\n\n“But it got published in the Periodical.”\n\n“And the Weekly Review stopped being published, so that’s why it didn’t come out then.”\n\n“That’s right; when it stopped, the Weekly Review joined with the Periodical, so your article came out in that two months ago. Didn’t you know?”\n\nRaskolnikov didn’t know that.\n\n“You could have made some money from the article! It’s odd how you live such a lonely life that you don’t know things that are important to you. It’s true, I promise.”\n\n“Good job, Rodya! I didn’t know about it either!” said Razumihin. “I’ll go to the reading room today and ask for that issue. Two months ago? What was the date?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov discovers that an article he wrote was published in a different review than he expected, highlighting his isolation from the world around him."
