I’ll answer it step by step. First, it’s not in my interest to arrest you directly.’\n\n‘Why not? If you really think you should…’\n\n‘Well, what if I do think so? That’s just a thought for now. Why should I make it easy for you? You know that’s what you’re asking me to do. If I show you that worker and you say to him, “Were you drunk or not? Who saw me with you?” I might just think you were drunk too. What could I say? Your story sounds more believable than his. His evidence is weak, especially since he looks rough, while you seem to fit the situation perfectly. He’s known to be a heavy drinker. I’ve already said that the psychology behind this can be seen in two ways, and the second way is stronger and more likely. Besides, I don’t have anything solid against you yet. Even though I will put you in prison and I’ve come—breaking the rules—to tell you this first, I’m being honest that it’s not to my advantage. Now, the second reason I’m here is because…’\n\n‘Yes, yes, the second reason?’ Raskolnikov listened closely. \n\n‘Because, as I just said, I feel I owe you an explanation.’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry Petroitch explains to Raskolnikov that arresting him directly is not in his interest despite believing him guilty."
