  "text": "Crime and Punishment  \n\nNapoleon really inspired him. He believed that many smart people have done bad things without thinking about the rules. He thought he was smart too, and for a while, he was sure of it. He has suffered a lot because he thinks he could come up with a big idea but can't break the rules, so he feels he isn't really a genius. This is embarrassing for a proud young man, especially today.\n\n\"But what about guilt? Do you think he has no moral feelings? Is he really like that?\"\n\n\"Oh, Avdotya Romanovna, everything is confusing now; it was never really clear. Russians generally have big ideas, just like their land, and they often think in strange and chaotic ways. But it's unfortunate to have big ideas without real genius. Remember all those talks we had on this topic while sitting on the terrace after dinner? You used to say I had big ideas! Maybe we were talking about it while he was here thinking about his plan. There are no strong traditions among us, especially in the educated class. Usually, someone just makes them up from books or old stories. But those are mostly for the scholars and old-fashioned people, so it would seem rude for someone in society. You know my views; I never blame anyone. I don't do anything at all, and I keep that up.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The discussion revolves around the idea that some individuals, believing themselves to be geniuses, justify wrongdoing by overstepping moral and legal boundaries, leading to a sense of humiliation when they fail to act boldly."
