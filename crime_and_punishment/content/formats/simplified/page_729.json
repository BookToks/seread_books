Dounia was there with her. She had visited Sonia that morning, remembering what Svidrigaïlov had said about her knowing things. \n\nWe won’t describe their conversation and tears, but the two girls became close friends. Dounia felt comforted knowing her brother wouldn’t be alone. He had come to Sonia first to confess and to seek support when he needed it. She would go with him wherever life took him. Dounia didn’t ask, but she knew it was true. She looked at Sonia with respect, which made Sonia feel a bit shy. Sonia almost cried, feeling unworthy to look at Dounia. Dounia’s kind image from their first meeting in Raskolnikov’s room stayed with her as one of the best memories of her life.\n\nEventually, Dounia got impatient and left Sonia to wait for her brother in his room, thinking he would come there first. After she left, Sonia became worried that he might try to kill himself, and Dounia was scared too. But they had spent the day trying to convince each other that this wouldn’t happen, and both were anxious.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia and Dounia anxiously await Raskolnikov, finding comfort in their bond as they fear for his well-being."
