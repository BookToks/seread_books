She didn't tell me everything because she didn't want to worry me, even though we talked all the time.\n\nEverything changed suddenly. Marfa Petrovna accidentally heard her husband begging Dounia in the garden. She misunderstood what was happening and blamed Dounia, thinking she was the reason for it all. They had a terrible fight right there in the garden. Marfa Petrovna even hit Dounia, wouldn't listen to her, and yelled at her for an hour. Then, she ordered that Dounia be sent to me right away in a simple peasant's cart. They just threw all her things—her clothes and linens—into the cart without folding them.\n\nIt started to rain heavily, and Dounia, feeling insulted and ashamed, had to ride with a peasant in an open cart for seventeen versts into town. Just think about what I could have said in the letter I got from you two months ago. I was in despair. I couldn’t tell you the truth because it would have made you very upset and angry, and there was nothing you could do. You might have ruined yourself trying to help, and Dounia wouldn't have allowed it. I couldn’t fill my letter with small talk when my heart was so full of sadness. For a whole month, the town was buzzing with gossip about this scandal, and it got really bad.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia faced severe humiliation and hardship due to misunderstandings and slander, culminating in her being sent away in disgrace."
