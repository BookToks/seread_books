  "text": "Raskolnikov was often thinking about Svidrigaïlov. After Svidrigaïlov said some scary things in Sonia's room when Katerina Ivanovna died, Raskolnikov's mind seemed to stop working right. Even though this worried him a lot, he wasn’t in a rush to figure it out.\n\nSometimes, when he found himself alone in a quiet part of town, sitting in a bad restaurant and lost in his thoughts, he suddenly thought of Svidrigaïlov. He realized, with a sense of dread, that he needed to talk to him and make some kind of agreement. One day, while walking outside the city, he imagined that they had planned to meet there and that he was waiting for Svidrigaïlov. Another time, he woke up early in the morning lying on the ground under some bushes and didn’t understand how he got there.\n\nIn the days after Katerina Ivanovna's death, he met Svidrigaïlov a few times at Sonia's place, where he had gone for no particular reason. They talked a little but avoided the important topic, almost as if they had agreed to ignore it for now.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna's body was still in the coffin, and Svidrigaïlov was busy planning the funeral. Sonia was also very occupied. At their last meeting, Svidrigaïlov told Raskolnikov that he had made a good arrangement for Katerina Ivanovna's children.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov grapples with his troubled thoughts about Svidrigaïlov following Katerina Ivanovna's death, recognizing the need for a confrontation."
