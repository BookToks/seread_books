  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nDounia told me that even though he is not very educated, he is smart and seems kind. You know your sister’s personality, Rodya. She is strong, sensible, patient, and generous, but she also has a passionate heart. There is not much love between them right now, but Dounia is a smart girl with a good heart. She will try to make her husband happy, and he will want to make her happy too. We have no reason to doubt that, even though everything has happened very quickly.\n\nHe is a careful man, and he knows that if Dounia is happy, he will be happy too. About any flaws or differences they might have, Dounia believes she can handle them. She is willing to accept a lot if their relationship can be honest and respectful. At first, he seemed a bit blunt to me, but that might just be because he speaks his mind.\n\nFor example, during his second visit, after Dounia agreed to marry him, he said that before meeting her, he had decided he wanted to marry a good woman who had no dowry and had experienced hardship. He explained that a man should not owe anything to his wife, and it’s better if she sees him as someone strong.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia is a sensible and generous woman who is prepared to make her marriage work despite the lack of deep love and the haste of the arrangement."
