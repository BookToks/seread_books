  "text": "The sad cries of the sick woman really touched everyone who heard her. Her weak, sickly face, dry lips, hoarse voice, and tears flowing like a child’s made everyone feel sorry for her. Even Pyotr Petrovitch felt pity right away.\n\n“Madam, this situation doesn’t reflect badly on you!” he said seriously. “No one would accuse you of being involved in it, especially since you showed her guilt by searching her pockets without knowing what would happen. I am very willing to show kindness if poverty pushed Sofya Semyonovna to this, but why didn’t you admit it, miss? Were you scared of being ashamed? Did you lose your mind? It’s understandable… But how could you do something like this? Gentlemen,” he spoke to everyone there, “out of pity for these people, I am ready to forgive this, even after the personal insult I received! Let this be a lesson for you in the future,” he said to Sonia, “and I won’t take it any further. That’s enough!”\n\nPyotr Petrovitch glanced at Raskolnikov. Their eyes met, and Raskolnikov’s gaze was full of anger. Meanwhile, Katerina Ivanovna seemed not to notice anything. She was hugging and kissing Sonia like she was crazy. The children were also hugging Sonia.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The scene depicts a moment of intense emotional turmoil as a sick woman pleads for help, eliciting compassion from the audience while highlighting the moral complexities surrounding poverty and guilt."
