  "text": "Dounia felt scared as she noticed something in Svidrigaïlov’s eyes that reminded her of a time when she was very frightened. She looked around nervously but tried not to show her fear. She realized that Svidrigaïlov’s place was in a quiet spot, and she wanted to ask if his landlady was home, but her pride stopped her. She was also dealing with a much bigger worry than her own fear. She was very upset.\n\n“Here is your letter,” she said, putting it on the table. “Is it true what you wrote? You suggest that my brother did something wrong. You’re being too obvious about it; you can’t deny it now. I want you to know that I heard about this silly story before and I don’t believe any of it. It’s a disgusting and foolish idea. I know how this story started. You have no proof. You promised to show me proof. Talk! But I want to warn you that I don’t believe you! I don’t believe you!”\n\nDounia spoke quickly, and for a moment, her face turned red.\n\n“If you didn’t believe it, why did you come here alone? Why did you come? Just out of curiosity?” \n\n“Don’t make it hard for me. Just talk!” \n\n“I can’t deny that you are very brave. Honestly, I thought you would have asked Mr. Razumihin to come with you. But he wasn’t with you or anywhere nearby. I noticed that. It’s brave of you, showing you wanted to protect Rodion Romanovitch. But everything about you is wonderful… What should I say about your brother?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia confronts Svidrigaïlov about a letter suggesting her brother's involvement in a crime, expressing her disbelief and distress."
