  "text": "Raskolnikov was following a man. He wondered if the man knew he was behind him. The man entered a big house, and Raskolnikov quickly went to the gate to see if he would signal him. In the courtyard, the man turned and seemed to wave him over. Raskolnikov followed him inside, but the man had disappeared. He must have gone up the first staircase. Raskolnikov ran after him and heard slow footsteps two flights up. The staircase felt oddly familiar.\n\nWhen he got to the first floor, the moonlight came through the windows, making everything look sad and mysterious. He went up to the second floor and realized it was the flat where the painters had been working. He wondered why he didn't recognize it right away. The footsteps above had stopped. \"He must have hidden somewhere,\" he thought. \n\nRaskolnikov reached the third floor and felt scared by the silence. He was afraid of his own footsteps in the dark. The man must be hiding nearby. The flat door was wide open, and he hesitated before going inside. It was dark and empty in the hallway, as if everything had been taken out. He quietly walked into the living room, which was bright with moonlight. Everything looked the same: the chairs, the mirror, the yellow sofa, and the pictures on the walls. A large, round, copper-red moon shone through the windows. \"The moon is making everything feel so quiet and mysterious,\" Raskolnikov thought. He stood there and waited for a long time.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov follows a mysterious man into a dark, familiar building, filled with a sense of dread and anticipation."
