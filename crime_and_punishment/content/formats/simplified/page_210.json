  "text": "Raskolnikov lay on the sofa. Pyotr Petrovitch asked, “What do you want?” This surprised the proud man. He was going to talk to Razumihin but changed his mind and spoke to Zossimov instead. \n\nZossimov pointed to Raskolnikov and mumbled, “This is Raskolnikov.” Then he yawned loudly and took out a big gold watch from his pocket.\n\nPyotr Petrovitch asked Zossimov, “Will I bother the sick person by being here and talking?” \n\nZossimov replied, “N-no, you can keep him company.” He yawned again. \n\nRazumihin said, “He has been awake for a long time, since morning.” Razumihin seemed friendly, which made Pyotr Petrovitch feel a bit better. \n\nPyotr Petrovitch seemed surprised when he realized Raskolnikov didn’t know who he was. He asked, “Have you really not heard anything yet?” \n\nRaskolnikov leaned back on the pillow, put his hands behind his head, and stared at the ceiling. Luzhin looked worried. Zossimov and Razumihin watched him closely, and Raskolnikov started to feel awkward. \n\nHe said, “I thought a letter sent over ten days ago…” \n\nRazumihin interrupted, “Why are you standing in the doorway? If you have something to say, sit down. Nastasya, make some space. Here’s a chair, come in!” \n\nHe moved his chair back and made room for the visitor. It was hard to refuse, so the visitor squeezed through, looking nervous. He sat down and glanced at Razumihin suspiciously. \n\nRazumihin said quickly, “No need to be nervous. Rodya has been sick for five days and confused for three, but he is getting better and has an appetite. This is his doctor who just checked on him. I’m a friend of Rodya’s, a former student, and I’m taking care of him, so just ignore us and keep talking.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, recovering from illness, is visited by Pyotr Petrovitch, who is disconcerted by the lack of communication regarding Raskolnikov's condition."
