This house was divided into small apartments and was home to all kinds of working people—tailors, locksmiths, cooks, various Germans, girls trying to make a living, and small office workers. There was always a lot of movement through the two gates and in the two courtyards of the building. Three or four doormen worked there. The young man was happy not to see any of them and quickly slipped through the door on the right and up the stairs. \n\nIt was a dark and narrow back staircase, but he knew it well and liked it because in that darkness, even the most curious eyes wouldn’t bother him. \n\nHe thought to himself, \"If I'm so scared now, how would I feel if I really went through with it?\" as he reached the fourth floor. There, he was stopped by some movers taking furniture out of an apartment. He knew that this apartment belonged to a German clerk and his family, and they were moving out. So, the fourth floor would only have the old woman left. \"That's good,\" he thought as he rang the bell for her apartment. The bell made a faint sound, like it was made of tin.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The young man nervously approaches the old woman's flat, contemplating his project while feeling increasingly anxious."
