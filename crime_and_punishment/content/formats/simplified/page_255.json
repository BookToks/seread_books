He has a family, a wife, and kids, including a daughter. It will take time to get him to the hospital, but there’s likely a doctor at his house. I’ll pay! At least he’ll get help right away. Otherwise, he might die before you get him to the hospital.” He managed to slip something into the policeman’s hand without anyone seeing. But it was a simple and honest act, and help was nearby. They lifted the injured man, and people offered to help.\n\nKozel’s house was thirty yards away. Raskolnikov walked behind, carefully holding Marmeladov’s head and guiding the way. “This way, this way! We need to take him upstairs head first. Turn around! I’ll pay you well,” he whispered.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna had just started, as she always did whenever she had free time, to pace in her small room from the window to the stove and back again, with her arms crossed, talking to herself and coughing. Lately, she had been talking even more to her oldest daughter, Polenka, who was ten. Although Polenka didn’t understand everything, she knew her mother needed her, so she watched her with big, smart eyes and tried hard to look like she understood. This time, Polenka was getting her little brother, who had been sick all day, ready for bed. The boy was waiting for her.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov urgently seeks help for an injured man, emphasizing the need for immediate care at a nearby house."
