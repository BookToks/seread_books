  "text": "Razumihin woke up the next morning at eight o'clock, feeling troubled and serious. He faced many new problems he hadn't expected. He never thought he would wake up feeling this way. He remembered everything from the day before and realized he had gone through a completely new experience. He understood that it revealed the bad side of his heart.\n\nHe wondered if he could ever dream about someone like her. He felt ashamed of being the loud, drunk guy from last night. It seemed ridiculous to compare himself to her. Just thinking about it made him blush. He remembered saying that the landlady would be jealous of Avdotya Romanovna, and that thought made him angry. He hit his fist on the kitchen stove, hurting his hand and knocking a brick loose.\n\nAfter a minute, he muttered to himself, feeling ashamed, \"Of course, I can't fix what I've done. It's pointless to even think about it. I have to go to them quietly and do my duty without asking for forgiveness or saying anything... because everything is lost now!\"\n\nAs he got dressed, he looked at his clothes more carefully than usual. He didn't have another suit; if he did, he might not have worn this one. \"I would have made sure not to wear it.\" But he knew he couldn't be a cynic and a messy person. He had to respect others' feelings, especially since they needed his help. He brushed his clothes carefully. His underwear was always clean; he took pride in that.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin grapples with feelings of shame and self-abasement after a night of drunkenness, reflecting on his behavior and the impact it has on his relationships."
