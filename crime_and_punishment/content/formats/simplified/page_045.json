  "text": "Raskolnikov was annoyed by the thought of the servant girl who sometimes looked into his room. He felt very tense and focused on one thing. For the last two weeks, his landlady had stopped bringing him meals, and he hadn’t even thought about asking her why, even though he was missing dinner. Nastasya, the cook and only servant, was happy about his mood and had stopped cleaning his room. She would only come in with a broom about once a week. She woke him up that day.\n\n“Get up, why are you still sleeping?” she called. “It’s past nine. I brought you some tea. Aren’t you starving?”\n\nRaskolnikov opened his eyes, startled, and recognized Nastasya.\n\n“From the landlady, right?” he asked, sitting up slowly with a tired look.\n\n“Yes, from the landlady!” she replied.\n\nShe put her own cracked teapot filled with weak, old tea in front of him and placed two yellow sugar cubes beside it.\n\n“Here, Nastasya, take this,” he said, reaching into his pocket (he had slept in his clothes) and pulling out some coins. “Run and buy me a loaf of bread. And get me a little sausage, the cheapest one from the butcher.”\n\n“I’ll get you the loaf right away, but wouldn’t you rather have some cabbage soup instead of sausage? It’s really good soup, from yesterday. I saved it for you.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is in a state of irritability and neglect, struggling with his living conditions and lack of food."
