  "text": "Raskolnikov didn’t say anything but stared hard at Porfiry. Razumihin looked unhappy and seemed to notice something. He glanced around angrily. There was a moment of heavy silence. Raskolnikov turned to leave.\n\n“Are you leaving already?” Porfiry asked nicely, reaching out his hand with too much politeness. “I’m very glad to meet you. About your request, don’t worry. Just write what I told you.”\n\n“Then you should be more careful,” Razumihin said seriously.\n\nPorfiry saw them to the door with extra politeness. They stepped out into the street feeling gloomy and quiet, not saying a word for a while. Raskolnikov took a deep breath.\n\n“Did you see any painters in the open flat on the second floor when you went upstairs between seven and eight?” Porfiry asked. “That’s really important.”\n\n“Painters? No, I didn’t see them,” Raskolnikov replied slowly, trying hard to remember. At the same time, he was feeling anxious and wanted to figure out the trap quickly. “No, I didn’t see them, and I don’t think I noticed an open flat. But on the fourth floor, I remember someone was moving out of the flat across from Alyona Ivanovna’s. I remember clearly. Some porters were carrying out a sofa, and they pushed me against the wall. But painters? No, I don’t remember any, and I don’t think there was an open flat.”\n\n“What do you mean?” Razumihin suddenly shouted, as if he realized something. “The painters were working on the day of the murder, and he was there three days before! What are you asking?”\n\n“Oh no! I mixed it up!” Porfiry hit himself on the forehead. “This case is driving me crazy!” He said to Raskolnikov, sounding a bit sorry. “It would really help us to find out if anyone saw them between seven and eight at the flat.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov anxiously navigates a conversation with Porfiry about the details surrounding a murder, trying to avoid revealing his knowledge of the crime."
