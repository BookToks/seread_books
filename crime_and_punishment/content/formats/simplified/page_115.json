  "text": "“Why, Alyona Ivanovna, you know me… Raskolnikov… I brought you the item I promised the other day…” He held out the item.\n\nThe old woman looked at the item for a moment, then stared at him with suspicion. She looked closely, with a mean and distrustful look. A minute went by, and he thought he saw a sneer in her eyes, like she already knew everything. He felt like he was losing control and was so scared that if she kept looking at him without saying anything for another half minute, he would run away.\n\n“Why do you look at me like you don’t know me?” he said suddenly, with some anger. “Take it if you want; if not, I’ll go somewhere else. I’m in a hurry.”\n\nHe hadn’t planned to say this, but it just came out. The old woman seemed to snap back to reality, and his strong tone gave her some confidence.\n\n“But why, my good sir, just a minute… What is it?” she asked, looking at the item.\n\n“It’s the silver cigarette case; I mentioned it last time, remember?” \n\nShe reached out her hand.\n\n“But you look so pale… and your hands are shaking too? Have you been swimming or something?”\n\n“Fever,” he replied sharply. “You can’t help getting pale… if you don’t have anything to eat,” he added, struggling to say the words. \n\nHe was feeling weak again. But his answer was clear.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov visits Alyona Ivanovna to present a pledge but feels increasingly anxious and mistrusted during the encounter."
