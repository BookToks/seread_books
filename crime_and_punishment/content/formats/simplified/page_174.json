  "text": "The sun was shining into the room, making a bright spot on the wall and near the door. Nastasya was next to him with another person he didn’t know. This young man had a beard and wore a short coat that made him look like a messenger. The landlady peeked in through the half-open door. Raskolnikov sat up.\n\n“Who is this, Nastasya?” he asked, pointing at the young man.\n\n“Look, he’s awake!” she said.\n\n“He is awake,” the young man repeated.\n\nSeeing that he was back to normal, the landlady closed the door and left. She was shy and didn’t like talking to people. She was about forty, not unattractive, plump, with black eyes and eyebrows. She seemed kind but also lazy and awkward.\n\n“Who are you?” Raskolnikov asked the young man. Just then, the door swung open, and Razumihin came in, bending down because he was tall.\n\n“What a small place!” he exclaimed. “I always hit my head. So you’re awake, brother? I just heard from Pashenka.”\n\n“He just woke up,” Nastasya said.\n\n“Just woke up,” the young man repeated with a smile.\n\n“And who are you?” Razumihin asked him suddenly. “My name is Vrazumihin, at your service; not Razumihin, which I’m usually called, but Vrazumihin.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov regains consciousness and is surrounded by curious onlookers, including a messenger and his friend Razumihin."
