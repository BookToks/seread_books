  "text": "A group of six men got into a cart, and there was still space for more. They pulled in a fat woman who was laughing and cracking nuts. She wore a red dress and a fancy hat. The crowd around them was laughing too because it was funny to see that poor horse trying to pull all of them quickly.\n\nTwo young guys in the cart got their whips ready to help Mikolka, the driver. When he shouted \"now,\" the horse pulled with all her strength, but instead of running fast, she could barely move. She struggled and gasped while the three whips hit her hard. The laughter from the cart and the crowd got louder, but Mikolka got angry and kept hitting the horse, thinking she could really go fast.\n\nA young man in the crowd wanted to join in and shouted, “Let me get in too!” Mikolka yelled back, “Get in, everyone! She can pull you all. I’ll beat her to death!” He kept hitting the horse, furious.\n\nA boy cried out, “Father, what are they doing? They’re hurting the poor horse!” His father tried to pull him away, saying, “They’re just drunk and being silly; come on, don’t look!” But the boy broke free and ran to the horse, horrified. The horse looked really bad. She was gasping, standing still, then trying to pull again but almost falling. Mikolka shouted, “Beat her to death; it’s come to that!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A drunken crowd cruelly forces a struggling mare to pull a heavy cart while laughing at her plight."
