She’ll come to you herself since she has run away,’ he said irritably. ‘If she doesn’t find you here, people will blame you….’  \n\nSonia sat down, feeling tense. Raskolnikov was quiet, looking at the floor and thinking.  \n‘This time Luzhin didn’t want to charge you,’ he said without looking at Sonia, ‘but if he had wanted to, he could have sent you to prison if it weren’t for Lebeziatnikov and me. Right?’  \n‘Yes,’ she said softly. ‘Yes,’ she repeated, looking worried and upset.  \n\n‘But I might not have been there. It was just a coincidence that Lebeziatnikov showed up.’  \nSonia didn’t say anything.  \n‘And if you had gone to prison, what would have happened? Do you remember what I said yesterday?’  \nAgain, she didn’t respond. He waited.  \n‘I thought you would shout again, “don’t talk about it, stop.”’ Raskolnikov laughed, but it sounded forced.  \n‘What, more silence?’ he asked a minute later. ‘We need to talk about something. I’d like to know how you would solve a certain “problem,” like Lebeziatnikov would say.’ (He was starting to lose his train of thought.) ‘No, really, I’m serious. Imagine, Sonia, that you knew all of Luzhin’s plans ahead of time. Knew for sure that they would ruin Katerina.’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov and Sonia discuss the potential consequences of Luzhin's actions on Katerina Ivanovna's life."
