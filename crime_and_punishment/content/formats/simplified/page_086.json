He jumped into the cart, grabbed the reins, and stood up in front. “The good horse went with Matvey,” he yelled from the cart, “and this old mare is breaking my heart. I feel like I could kill her. She’s eating too much! Get in, I tell you! I’ll make her gallop! She’ll gallop!” He picked up the whip, ready to hit the little mare.\n\n“Get in! Come on!” The crowd laughed. “Did you hear? She’ll gallop!”  \n“Gallop? She hasn’t galloped in ten years!”  \n“She’ll just jog along!”  \n“Don’t worry about her, everyone bring a whip and get ready!”  \n“Alright! Let’s give it to her!”  \n\nThey all climbed into Mikolka’s cart, still laughing.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A group of drunken peasants humorously mocks a young man named Mikolka as he insists his old mare can still gallop while preparing to whip her."
