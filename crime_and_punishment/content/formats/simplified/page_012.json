  "text": "The little apartments in these houses always have bells that ring like that. He had forgotten how that bell sounded, and now its strange sound seemed to remind him of something important. His nerves were really on edge. \n\nSoon, the door opened a little bit. The old woman looked at her visitor with clear distrust through the small opening, and all that could be seen were her little eyes shining in the dark. But when she noticed several people in the hallway, she became braver and opened the door wide. \n\nThe young man stepped into the dark entry, which was separated from the small kitchen. The old woman stood in front of him, silent and looking at him with curiosity. She was a small, frail old woman, about sixty years old, with sharp, mean-looking eyes and a pointed nose. Her hair was colorless and a bit gray, and it was covered in oil, with no scarf on it. Around her thin neck, which looked like a chicken's leg, was tied a piece of flannel. Even though it was warm, she wore a ragged fur cape that was yellowed with age. The old woman coughed and groaned all the time. \n\nThe young man must have looked at her strangely, because she showed mistrust in her eyes again. \n\n“Raskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago,” he quickly said, bowing a little, remembering he should be more polite. \n\n“I remember, my good sir, I remember your visit well,” the old woman replied clearly, still watching his face closely.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov visits an old woman, feeling increasingly anxious and mistrusted as he prepares for his unsettling purpose."
