  "text": "The little apartments in these houses always have bells that ring like that. He had forgotten what that bell sounded like, and now its strange sound seemed to remind him of something important. He felt very nervous. \n\nAfter a while, the door opened a little bit. The old woman looked at him with clear distrust through the small opening, and all he could see were her tiny eyes shining in the dark. But when she saw other people in the hallway, she became braver and opened the door wide. The young man walked into the dark entryway, which was separated from the small kitchen. The old woman stood in front of him in silence, looking at him with curiosity.\n\nShe was a tiny, old woman about sixty years old, with sharp, mean-looking eyes and a small nose. Her hair was gray and greasy, and she didn't wear a headscarf. Around her thin neck, which looked like a chicken's leg, she had tied a piece of old cloth. Even though it was hot, she wore a ragged fur cape that was yellow with age. The old woman coughed and groaned all the time. The young man must have looked at her strangely because a look of distrust came back into her eyes.\n\n\"I'm Raskolnikov, a student. I came here a month ago,\" he quickly said, trying to be polite and bowing a little. \n\n\"I remember, my good sir, I remember your visit very well,\" the old woman replied clearly, still watching his face closely.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov visits an old woman in a dark entry, feeling increasingly anxious and mistrusted."
