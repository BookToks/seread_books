  "text": "The little apartments in these houses always have bells that ring like that. He had forgotten how that bell sounded, and now its strange ringing reminded him of something. He felt very nervous. \n\nAfter a while, the door opened a little bit. The old woman looked at him with clear distrust through the crack, and all he could see were her small eyes shining in the dark. But when she saw some people in the hallway, she became braver and opened the door wide. The young man stepped into the dark entry, which was separated from the tiny kitchen. The old woman stood in front of him, silent and looking at him curiously.\n\nShe was a small, old woman about sixty years old, with sharp, mean-looking eyes and a small pointed nose. Her hair was thin, gray, and greasy, and she didn’t wear a scarf over it. Around her skinny neck, which looked like a chicken's leg, was a piece of old flannel. Even though it was hot, she wore a ragged fur cape that was yellow with age. The old woman coughed and groaned a lot. The young man must have looked at her strangely because she showed more distrust in her eyes.\n\n“Raskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago,” the young man quickly said with a slight bow, remembering he should be polite. \n\n“I remember, my good sir, I remember your visit well,” the old woman replied clearly, still studying his face.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov visits an old woman, feeling increasingly anxious and mistrusted as he prepares for a significant encounter."
