  "text": "Intense disgust made Raskolnikov turn away from Svidrigaïlov. \n\n\"To think I could have ever looked for help from that rude, selfish jerk!\" he shouted. \n\nRaskolnikov realized he judged Svidrigaïlov too quickly. There was something unique and even mysterious about him. Raskolnikov was sure Svidrigaïlov would not leave his sister alone. But it was too tiring and frustrating to keep thinking about it. \n\nWhen he was alone, he didn’t walk far before he fell into deep thought, as usual. On the bridge, he leaned on the railing and stared at the water. His sister was standing close by him. \n\nHe saw her at the entrance to the bridge but walked past without noticing her. Dounia had never seen him like this in the street before and felt worried. She stood still, unsure if she should call out to him. Suddenly, she noticed Svidrigaïlov coming quickly from the direction of the Hay Market. \n\nHe seemed to be approaching carefully. He didn’t go onto the bridge but stood on the sidewalk, trying not to let Raskolnikov see him. He had been watching Dounia for a while and was signaling to her. She thought he was asking her not to talk to her brother but to come to him. \n\nSo, Dounia quietly moved past her brother and went up to Svidrigaïlov.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels intense disgust towards Svidrigaïlov, believing he poses a threat to his sister Dounia, while he is lost in deep thought about their interactions."
