  "text": "Sonia heard Raskolnikov's request with doubt and slowly moved to the table. She picked up the book.\n\n\"Haven't you read it?\" she asked, looking at him from across the table. \n\nHer voice got more serious. \n\n\"Long ago... when I was in school. Read!\" \n\n\"And haven't you heard it in church?\" \n\n\"I... haven't been. Do you go often?\" \n\n\"N-no,\" Sonia whispered. \n\nRaskolnikov smiled. \n\n\"I see... And you won't go to your father's funeral tomorrow?\" \n\n\"Yes, I will. I was at church last week too... I had a requiem service.\" \n\n\"For whom?\" \n\n\"For Lizaveta. She was killed with an axe.\" \n\nHe felt more and more nervous. His head started to spin. \n\n\"Were you friends with Lizaveta?\" \n\n\"Yes... She was good... she used to come... not often... she couldn't... We used to read together and... talk. She will see God.\" \n\nThat last part sounded strange to him. And now there was something new: the secret meetings with Lizaveta and both of them being very religious. \n\n\"I will be a religious maniac myself soon! It's contagious!\" \n\n\"Read!\" he said, getting annoyed. \n\nSonia still hesitated. Her heart was racing. She was scared to read to him. He looked almost frustrated.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov urges Sonia to read from the New Testament, revealing their shared connection to faith and loss."
