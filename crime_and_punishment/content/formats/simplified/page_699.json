Your sisters and brother are taken care of, and I’ve put the money meant for them in a safe place. I have receipts for it. You should keep the receipts, just in case something happens. Here, take them! Now that’s settled. Here are three bonds worth three thousand roubles. Take these for yourself, just for you, and let’s keep it between us, so no one else knows. You will need the money because living the old way is not good, and there’s no need for it now.”\n\n“I owe you so much, and so do the children and my stepmother,” Sonia said quickly. “If I haven’t said much… please don’t think….”\n\n“That’s enough! That’s enough!” \n\n“But about the money, Arkady Ivanovitch, I really appreciate it, but I don’t need it now. I can earn my own living. Don’t think I’m ungrateful. If you want to be kind, that money….”\n\n“It’s for you, Sofya Semyonovna, and please don’t waste time talking about it. I don’t have time for that. You will need it. Rodion Romanovitch has two choices: a bullet in the head or Siberia.” (Sonia looked at him in shock.) “Don’t worry, I know all about it from him, and I’m not spreading rumors; I won’t tell anyone. It was good advice when you told him to give himself up and confess. It would be much better.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Arkady Ivanovitch gives Sonia three 5-percent bonds for her future needs, emphasizing the importance of the money due to Rodion's dire situation."
