  "text": "I need to ask you, Sofya Semyonovna, to come here. I think it’s not safe to give money directly to Katerina Ivanovna. Today’s dinner shows that. Even though she doesn’t have enough food for tomorrow, she bought Jamaica rum, Madeira, and coffee. I saw it when I walked by. Tomorrow, they won’t have any food again. It’s really silly, so I think we should collect money to help the widow without her knowing, just you and me. Am I right?\n\n“I don’t know... this is just today, one time in her life. She wanted to honor someone and celebrate their memory. She’s very smart, but just like you think, I will be very... they will all be... and God will reward... and the orphans...”\n\nSonia started to cry.\n\n“Okay, keep that in mind. Now will you take this small amount of money from me for your family? I really don’t want my name to be mentioned with it. Here... I can’t give more because I have my own worries...”\n\nPyotr Petrovitch handed Sonia a ten-rouble note. Sonia took it, turned red, stood up, mumbled something, and started to leave. Pyotr Petrovitch politely walked her to the door. She finally left the room, feeling upset and anxious.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pyotr Petrovitch expresses concern about Katerina Ivanovna's reckless spending despite her dire financial situation and offers Sonia a small sum to help."
