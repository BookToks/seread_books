She’ll be my nurse.\"\n\n\"Cross yourself, say at least one prayer,\" Sonia asked softly.\n\n\"Oh sure, as much as you want! And really, Sonia, really….\"\n\nBut he wanted to say something else.\n\nHe crossed himself several times. Sonia took her shawl and put it over her head. It was the green shawl that Marmeladov had mentioned, \"the family shawl.\" Raskolnikov thought about that but didn’t ask. He started to realize that he was forgetting things and felt very uneasy. This scared him. He suddenly thought that Sonia wanted to go with him.\n\n\"What are you doing? Where are you going? Stay here, stay! I’ll go alone,\" he said in a frustrated tone, almost angry, as he moved towards the door. \"What’s the point of going in a group?\" he muttered as he left.\n\nSonia stood in the middle of the room. He hadn’t even said goodbye to her; he had forgotten about her. A strong feeling of doubt filled his heart.\n\n\"Was this right? Was it right to do all this?\" he thought again as he went down the stairs. \"Couldn’t he just stop and change his mind… and not go?\"\n\nBut he kept going. He suddenly felt that he shouldn’t ask himself questions. As he stepped outside, he remembered that he hadn’t said goodbye to Sonia and had left her in the middle of the room with her green shawl.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences agitation and doubt as he prepares to leave Sonia, feeling a mix of cowardice and rebellion about his decision."
