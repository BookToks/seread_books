The mare staggered, tried to pull away, but then he hit her again hard on her back, and she fell to the ground like a log. \n\n\"Finish her off!\" Mikolka shouted as he jumped out of the cart. Several young men, also drunk, grabbed whips, sticks, and poles and ran to the dying mare. Mikolka stood to the side and started hitting her with a crowbar. The mare stretched out her head, took a deep breath, and died. \n\n\"You killed her!\" someone in the crowd shouted. \n\n\"Why didn't she run then?\" \n\n\"It's my property!\" Mikolka yelled, his eyes red, waving the crowbar. He looked like he wished he had something else to hit her with. \n\n\"You're not a Christian!\" many voices shouted from the crowd. \n\nBut the poor boy, upset, pushed through the crowd to the dead mare. He wrapped his arms around her bleeding head and kissed it, kissed her eyes and lips. Then he jumped up and angrily ran at Mikolka. Just then, his father, who had been chasing him, picked him up and carried him away from the crowd. \n\n\"Come on, let's go home,\" he said. \n\n\"Father! Why did they kill the poor horse?\" he cried, his voice breaking as he shouted from his heavy breathing.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Mikolka brutally beats a mare to death while a horrified crowd looks on, prompting a young boy to mourn the animal's suffering."
