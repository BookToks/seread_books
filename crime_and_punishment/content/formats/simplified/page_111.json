The stairs to the old woman’s room were right next to the gate. He was already on the stairs.\n\nTaking a breath, pressing his hand against his pounding heart, and checking the axe to make sure it was ready, he started going up the stairs quietly, listening carefully. But the stairs were empty; all the doors were closed, and he didn’t see anyone. One apartment on the first floor was wide open with painters working inside, but they didn’t look at him.
