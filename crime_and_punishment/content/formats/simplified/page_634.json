  "text": "\"Crime and Punishment\"\n\nAbout your bell ringing when you were sick and a bit out of it? \n\nSo, Rodion Romanovitch, can you blame me for messing with you? What made you show up right then? It felt like someone sent you! And if Nikolay hadn't separated us... do you remember Nikolay from back then? Do you remember him well? It was shocking, like a thunderbolt! And how I met him! I couldn't believe it at all. You could see it clearly; how could I? Even later, after you left, when he started giving really good answers about some things, I was surprised by him too, but I still didn’t believe his story! You see how strong I am? No, I thought, Morgenfrüh. What does Nikolay have to do with this?\n\nRazumihin just told me that you think Nikolay is guilty and you told him that too...\n\nHis voice trailed off. He was listening with great anxiety as this man, who understood him completely, turned the focus back on himself. He was scared to believe it and didn’t believe it. In those unclear words, he kept looking for something more clear and certain.\n\n“Mr. Razumihin!” Porfiry Petrovitch called out, seeming happy for a question from Raskolnikov, who had been quiet until then. “He-he-he! But I had to send Mr. Razumihin away; two is company, three is a crowd. Mr. Razumihin isn’t the right person; he’s an outsider. He came to me looking pale... But let’s not talk about him. Back to Nikolay, do you want to know what kind of person he is?\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The conversation reveals Raskolnikov's inner turmoil and uncertainty regarding Nikolay's guilt amidst a tense psychological atmosphere."
