  "text": "I said, “Go away, you troublemaker!” He turned and left, and I never saw him again. I didn’t tell Marfa Petrovna then. I wanted to have a service for him, but I felt embarrassed.\n\n“You should see a doctor.”  \n“I know I’m not well without you telling me, even though I’m not sure what’s wrong. I think I’m much stronger than you.”  \n“I didn’t ask if you believe in ghosts appearing, but if you think they really exist.”  \n“No, I won’t believe it!” Raskolnikov shouted, clearly angry.  \n“What do people usually say?” Svidrigaïlov mumbled, as if talking to himself, looking away and lowering his head. “They say, ‘You’re sick, so what you see isn’t real.’ But that doesn’t make sense. I agree that ghosts appear to sick people, but that just shows they can only appear to the sick, not that they don’t exist.”  \n“Not at all,” Raskolnikov said, getting annoyed.  \n“No? You don’t think so?” Svidrigaïlov continued, looking at him closely. “But what about this idea: ghosts are bits and pieces of other worlds, the start of them. A healthy person has no reason to see them because they are focused on this life. But when someone is sick, and their body isn’t working right, they start to see the possibility of another world. The sicker you are, the closer you feel to it.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov argues that ghosts may only appear to the sick, suggesting they are fragments of another world, while Raskolnikov vehemently denies their existence."
