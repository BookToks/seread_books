Wouldn’t it be better to go somewhere far away, like the islands, and hide the things in a quiet place, maybe in a forest or under a bush, and remember where I put them?” Even though he felt confused, this idea seemed good to him. But he wasn’t meant to go there.\n\nAs he came out of V—— Prospect towards the square, he saw a path on the left that led between two plain walls to a courtyard. On the right, a tall, dirty wall of a four-story building stretched into the yard. On the left, a wooden fence ran for twenty steps and then turned sharply left. This was an empty, fenced area where different kinds of trash were lying around. At the end of the yard, he could see a small, dirty stone shed, likely part of a workshop. It looked like a place for building carriages or doing carpentry, and everything was covered in coal dust. He thought this would be a good place to throw the things away.\n\nNot seeing anyone in the yard, he slipped in and noticed a sink near the gate, like the ones often found in places with many workers or cab drivers. Above it, someone had written in chalk, “Standing here strictly forbidden.” This was good because it made his entrance seem normal. “I could throw everything in a pile and leave!” \n\nLooking around again, with his hand already in his pocket, he saw a big, rough stone against the outer wall, between the entrance and the sink. It probably weighed a lot.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist contemplates hiding incriminating items in a secluded location but ultimately finds a potential spot in a deserted courtyard."
