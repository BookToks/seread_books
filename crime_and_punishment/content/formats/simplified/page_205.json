  "text": "The bodies upstairs were warm when they found them. If Nikolay or anyone else had killed them and opened the boxes, let me ask you this: does their behavior—squealing, giggling, and playing around—match with murder and robbery? They had just killed the people, and the bodies were still warm, yet they left the flat open, knowing people would come, and acted like kids, laughing and drawing attention. There are many witnesses who can confirm this!\n\nOf course, it’s strange! It seems impossible, but… \n\nNo, brother, no excuses. If the ear-rings were found in Nikolay's hands right when the murder happened, that’s important evidence against him. Even though his explanation makes sense, we still need to look at the facts that show he is innocent, and those facts are undeniable. Do you really think our legal system will accept this idea—just because it seems psychologically impossible—as proof that clears him? No, they won’t accept it. They found the jewel-case, and he tried to hang himself, which he wouldn’t have done if he didn’t feel guilty. That’s what worries me, you need to understand!\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The discussion revolves around the circumstantial evidence against Nikolay, questioning the psychological plausibility of his guilt despite the presence of incriminating items."
