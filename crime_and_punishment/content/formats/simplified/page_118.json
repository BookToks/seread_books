He bent down to look at her closely and saw that her skull was broken. He almost touched it but pulled his hand back because it was obvious she was dead. There was a lot of blood on the floor.\n\nSuddenly, he noticed a string around her neck. He pulled on it, but it was strong and covered in blood. He tried to pull it from the front of her dress, but something was holding it. In his impatience, he raised the axe again to cut the string, but hesitated. After two minutes of struggling and getting blood on his hands and the axe, he finally cut the string without touching her body with the axe. It was a purse.\n\nThe string had two crosses, one made of Cyprus wood and one of copper, along with a small leather purse that was full. Raskolnikov shoved it into his pocket without looking at it, threw the crosses on the old woman's body, and rushed back into the bedroom, taking the axe with him.\n\nHe was in a huge hurry, grabbed the keys, and tried them again, but none of them worked. It wasn't just that his hands were shaking; he kept making mistakes. He could see when a key didn't fit, but he still tried.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, after killing the old woman, attempts to retrieve a purse from her body while struggling with his panic and the keys to a strong box."
