  "text": "You might have lived a good life, but it will all end badly. If you stay alone, you’ll lose your mind like I have. You are already acting crazy. So, we should go together on the same path! \n\n“Why? What’s the point of all this?” Sonia asked, feeling very upset by what he said.\n\n“Why? Because you can’t stay like this! You need to face the truth and stop crying like a child, saying God won’t allow it. What if you have to go to the hospital tomorrow? She is sick and will die soon, and what about the children? Do you think Polenka will be okay? Have you seen kids begging on the streets? I know where their mothers live and how they live. Kids can’t stay innocent in those places! By seven, they’re already bad and stealing. But remember, children are like Christ: ‘theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.’ He told us to love and honor them; they are the future of humanity…”\n\n“What should we do? What should we do?” Sonia cried, very upset and wringing her hands.\n\n“What should we do? Break what needs to be broken, and take on the pain yourself. Don’t you understand? You will understand later… Freedom and power, especially power! Over everything and everyone! That’s the goal, remember that! This is my goodbye message. Maybe it’s the last time I’ll see you.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov urges Sonia to confront harsh realities and take decisive action for their future, emphasizing the need for power and freedom."
