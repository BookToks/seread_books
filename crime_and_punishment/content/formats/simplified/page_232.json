  "text": "Raskolnikov tapped Zametov on the shoulder. “I’m not upset, just being friendly, like your worker said when he was fighting with Dmitri about the old woman…”\n\n“How do you know about that?”\n\n“Maybe I know more than you do.”\n\n“You’re so strange… I think you’re still not well. You shouldn’t have come out.”\n\n“Do I seem strange to you?”\n\n“Yes. What are you doing, reading the papers?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“There’s a lot about the fires.”\n\n“No, I’m not reading about the fires.” He looked at Zametov in a mysterious way, smiling mockingly. “No, I’m not reading about the fires. But admit it, you really want to know what I’m reading about?”\n\n“I’m not at all. Can’t I ask a question? Why do you keep on…?”\n\n“Listen, you’re a cultured and educated man, right?”\n\n“I was in the sixth class at school,” Zametov said proudly.\n\n“Sixth class! Ah, my little friend! With your hairstyle and your rings, you look like a rich kid. Wow, what a charming boy!” Raskolnikov laughed nervously right in Zametov’s face. Zametov stepped back, more surprised than offended.\n\n“Wow! You’re so strange!” Zametov said seriously.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov engages in a cryptic conversation with Zametov, hinting at deeper thoughts while appearing unwell and strange."
