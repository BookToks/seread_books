  "text": "You are still young, so you think being smart is the most important thing, just like many young people do. You enjoy clever jokes and complicated ideas, which reminds me of an old military group that thought they had defeated Napoleon on paper. They planned everything perfectly, but in reality, General Mack gave up with his whole army. \n\nI know you’re laughing at someone like me using military examples! But I can’t help it; I really like military history. I should have joined the army; I might not have been a great leader like Napoleon, but I could have been a major!\n\nNow, let me tell you the truth about this special situation: real facts and a person's character are very important, and they can sometimes trick even the smartest people. Listen to me, Rodion Romanovitch, as an older man, I’m serious about this. I might not be that old, but I feel like I’ve aged when I say it. \n\nAlso, I consider myself honest. I share these thoughts without expecting anything in return. Wit is a wonderful thing; it makes life better and can create surprising situations. Sometimes, it can be really hard for someone trying to investigate a case.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The speaker reflects on the deceptive nature of wit and intellect, emphasizing the importance of actual facts and human temperament over clever arguments."
