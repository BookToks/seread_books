  "text": "Dounia changed the topic of conversation so much that it was impossible to talk without mentioning where Rodya was. When she got unsatisfactory and suspicious answers, she became sad and quiet, and this mood lasted a long time. Dounia realized it was hard to hide the truth from her mother and decided it was better to stay completely silent about some things. But it became clear that their mother suspected something terrible was going on. Dounia remembered that her brother had told her their mother overheard her talking in her sleep after her meeting with Svidriga√Ølov and before the day of the confession. Did she figure something out from that? \n\nSometimes, days or even weeks of sad silence and tears would be followed by a time when their mother would talk a lot about her son and her hopes for his future. Her thoughts were sometimes very strange. They went along with her and pretended to agree, but she might have noticed they were pretending. Still, she kept talking.\n\nFive months after Raskolnikov's confession, he was sentenced. Razumihin and Sonia visited him in prison as often as they could. Finally, the time to say goodbye came. Dounia promised her brother that they would not be separated forever, and Razumihin made the same promise. Razumihin, full of youthful energy, decided to work hard over the next three or four years to save money. He planned to move to Siberia, a place rich in resources and needing workers. There, they would settle down.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pulcheria Alexandrovna's growing suspicion about her son Rodya's situation leads to a prolonged period of gloom and silence in the family, despite their attempts to maintain hope."
