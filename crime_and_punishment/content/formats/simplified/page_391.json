Why did she have to come in? It's strange that I hardly ever think about her, like I didn't even kill her. Lizaveta! Sonia! Poor, gentle girls with kind eyes... Dear women! Why don't they cry? Why don't they make noise? They give up everything... their eyes are soft and kind... Sonia, Sonia! Kind Sonia!\"\n\nHe lost track of time and found it strange that he didn’t remember how he got outside. It was late evening. The sky was darkening, and the full moon was shining brightly, but the air felt heavy. The streets were crowded with people; workers and businesspeople were heading home, while others were out for a walk. There was a smell of dust, mortar, and still water. Raskolnikov walked along, feeling sad and worried. He knew he had come out for a reason and needed to do something quickly, but he couldn’t remember what it was. \n\nSuddenly, he stopped and saw a man across the street, waving to him. He crossed over, but the man turned and walked away, looking down as if he hadn’t waved. \"Did he really wave?\" Raskolnikov wondered, but he tried to catch up with him. When he got close, he recognized the man and felt scared; it was the same man with hunched shoulders in the long coat. Raskolnikov followed him.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov grapples with his guilt and confusion after committing murder, reflecting on the women he has harmed and feeling a sense of urgency despite forgetting his purpose."
