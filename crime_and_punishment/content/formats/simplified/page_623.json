What do I need to drink for now? You’ve made me feel drunk without wine. I am drunk, Rodya! Goodbye, I’m leaving. I’ll come back very soon.’  \nHe went out.  \n‘He’s definitely a political conspirator,’ Razumihin thought as he walked down the stairs slowly. ‘And he’s involved his sister in this; that fits Avdotya Romanovna’s character. They have meetings! She hinted at it too… So many of her words and hints mean that! And how else can all this be explained? Hm! I almost thought… Good heavens, what was I thinking! Yes, I lost my mind and was wrong about him! It was his doing that day under the lamp in the corridor. Phew! What a terrible, nasty idea that was! Nikolay is brave for confessing… And now it all makes sense! His illness, all his strange actions… before this, at the university, he was so gloomy. But what does that letter mean now? There’s something in that too, maybe. Who was it from? I suspect…! No, I need to find out!’  \nHe thought about Dounia, realizing everything he heard, and his heart raced, making him suddenly run.  \nAs soon as Razumihin left, Raskolnikov got up, turned to the window, and walked into one corner and then into another.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin suspects Raskolnikov's involvement in political conspiracies and reflects on the implications for his sister Dounia."
