  "text": "\"It won’t be hard, I promise. Just talk to her about anything, as long as you sit with her and chat. You’re a doctor, so try to help her with something. I swear you’ll be glad you did. She has a piano, and I play a little. I have a song called ‘I shed hot tears.’ She likes real music—and it all started with that song. Now you’re a great performer, like Rubinstein…. I promise you won’t regret it!\"\n\n\"But did you promise her something? Like a signed agreement? Maybe a promise of marriage?\"\n\n\"Nothing like that at all! Besides, she’s not that kind of person…. Tchebarov tried that….\"\n\n\"Then just forget her!\"\n\n\"But I can’t just forget her!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I don’t know, I just can’t! There’s something pulling me in, brother.\"\n\n\"Then why did you charm her?\"\n\n\"I didn’t charm her; maybe I was charmed myself. But she won’t care if it’s you or me, as long as someone is there next to her, sighing…. I can’t explain it well, brother … look, you’re good at math and working on it now … start teaching her calculus; I’m serious, it’ll be the same for her. She will look at you and sigh for a whole year. I once talked to her for two days about the Prussian House of Lords (because you have to talk about something)—she just sighed and sweated! And don’t talk about love—she gets really shy.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin encourages Raskolnikov to engage with a woman by simply being present and talking to her, suggesting that emotional connection can develop without the need for promises or declarations of love."
