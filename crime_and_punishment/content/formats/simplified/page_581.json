It’s because I can’t handle my problems and want to share them with you: you’re hurting too, and that makes me feel a bit better! How can you love someone so low like me?”\n\n“But aren’t you hurting too?” Sonia cried.\n\nHe felt the same emotion again in his heart, and it softened him for a moment. \n\n“Sonia, I have a bad heart, remember that. It might explain a lot. I came because I am bad. Some men wouldn’t have come, but I am a coward and… a low person. But… never mind! That’s not the point. I need to talk now, but I don’t know how to start.”\n\nHe paused and thought deeply.\n\n“Oh, we are so different,” he said again. “We are not the same. And why did I come? I will never forgive myself for that.”\n\n“No, no, it was good that you came,” Sonia said. “It’s better for me to know, much better!”\n\nHe looked at her with pain.\n\n“What if it really was that?” he said, as if he had reached a conclusion. “Yes, that’s what it was! I wanted to be like Napoleon, that’s why I killed her… Do you understand now?”\n\n“N-no,” Sonia whispered shyly. “Just talk, talk, and I will understand, I will understand in my own way!” she kept begging him.\n\n“You’ll understand? Alright, we’ll see!” He paused and got lost in thought for a while.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confesses to Sonia that his desire to become a great figure like Napoleon motivated his crime, revealing his inner turmoil and sense of guilt."
