  "text": "Razumihin is sitting here, but he doesn't notice anything. That clueless guy never sees what's going on! I'm feeling anxious again. Did Porfiry just wink at me? That's silly! Why would he wink? Are they trying to mess with my head or are they joking? Either I'm imagining things or they know something! Even Zametov is being rude. Has he changed his mind? I thought he would! He feels at home here, but it's my first time visiting. Porfiry doesn't think of him as a guest; he sits with his back to him. They seem really close, probably talking about me before we got here. Do they know about the flat? I wish they'd hurry up! When I mentioned I ran off to get a flat, he just let it go. I cleverly brought up the flat; it might help me later. I must be losing it… ha-ha-ha! He knows all about last night! He didn’t know my mom was coming! She wrote the date in pencil! You won’t catch me! There are no facts, just guesses! Show me the facts! The flat isn’t even a fact, just my imagination. I know what to say to them. Do they know about the flat? I won’t leave without finding out. Why did I come here? But maybe being angry is a fact! I'm such a fool, getting so worked up! Maybe it’s smart to act sick. He’s trying to figure me out. Why did I come here?\n\nAll these thoughts raced through his mind.\n\nPorfiry Petrovitch came back quickly, suddenly cheerful. \n\n\"Your party yesterday really messed with my head, brother, and I'm feeling out of sorts,\" he said with a smile.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is consumed by paranoia and anxiety about being scrutinized by Porfiry and others regarding his actions."
