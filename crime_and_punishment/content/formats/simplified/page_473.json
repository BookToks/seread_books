There's no rush, there's no rush,\" Porfiry Petrovitch mumbled, moving around the table without a clear purpose. He would go towards the window, then the desk, and then back to Raskolnikov, sometimes avoiding his suspicious gaze and sometimes looking him right in the eye.\n\nHis round body looked funny, like a ball rolling from side to side.\n\n\"We have plenty of time. Do you smoke? Do you have your own? Here, take a cigarette!\" he said, offering one to Raskolnikov. \"You know, I'm meeting you here, but my actual office is in the other room. I'm living here for now because I had some repairs done. It's almost finished now... Government offices are really nice. What do you think?\"\n\n\"Yes, they're nice,\" Raskolnikov replied, looking at him with a bit of irony.\n\n\"They're nice, they're nice,\" Porfiry Petrovitch repeated, as if he had just thought of something else. \"Yes, they're really nice,\" he suddenly shouted, staring at Raskolnikov and stopping just a couple of steps away.\n\nThis silly repetition felt out of place compared to the serious and mysterious look he gave Raskolnikov, which only made Raskolnikov more irritated.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels increasingly anxious and suspicious during a tense conversation with Porfiry Petrovitch, who is behaving oddly."
