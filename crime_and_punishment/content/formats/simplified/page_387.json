  "text": "Raskolnikov stood still, watching the man walk away without looking back. After a moment, the man turned around about fifty steps away and looked back at Raskolnikov. He thought he saw the man smiling with cold hatred and victory.\n\nFeeling weak and shaky, Raskolnikov slowly walked back to his small room, feeling cold all over. He took off his cap and placed it on the table, standing still for ten minutes. Then, he collapsed onto the sofa and let out a soft moan of pain. He lay there for half an hour.\n\nHe didn’t think about anything specific. Random thoughts and images floated in his mind—faces from his childhood, a church bell tower, a billiard table in a restaurant with officers playing, the smell of cigars from a tobacco shop, a dark, dirty staircase, and church bells ringing from somewhere. The images came and went quickly. Some he liked and tried to hold onto, but they disappeared, and he felt a pressure inside him that wasn’t too strong and sometimes even felt nice. He still felt a slight shiver, but it was almost a pleasant feeling.\n\nHe heard Razumihin’s fast footsteps and closed his eyes, pretending to be asleep. Razumihin opened the door.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, feeling cold and exhausted, reflects on fragmented memories and sensations while pretending to sleep as Razumihin approaches."
