  "text": "Raskolnikov quickly went back into his apartment and closed the door behind him. He quietly locked it and crouched down by the door, holding his breath. The visitor was now at the door too. They stood facing each other, just like he had with the old woman before.\n\nThe visitor was breathing heavily. Raskolnikov thought, “He must be a big guy,” while gripping the axe tightly. It felt like a dream. The visitor rang the doorbell loudly.\n\nWhen the bell rang, Raskolnikov noticed something moving in the room. He listened carefully. The visitor rang again, waited, and then pulled hard on the door handle. Raskolnikov watched in fear as the hook shook, worried it might come loose. It seemed possible since the visitor was pulling so hard. He thought about holding the hook, but that might give him away. He felt dizzy and thought, “I might fall!” But then the visitor started talking, and he quickly collected himself.\n\n“What's going on? Are they asleep or dead? Damn them!” he shouted in a thick voice. “Hey, Alyona Ivanovna, old witch! Lizaveta Ivanovna, my beauty! Open the door! Oh, damn them! Are they asleep or what?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov hides in fear as an unknown visitor aggressively attempts to enter the flat, heightening his anxiety and tension."
