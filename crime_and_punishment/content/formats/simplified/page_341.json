Oh, I said good-bye again.” \n\nPulcheria Alexandrovna wanted to say hello to Sonia too, but it didn’t happen, and she hurried out of the room. \n\nAvdotya Romanovna waited her turn and followed her mother out, giving Sonia a polite bow. Sonia, feeling nervous, quickly curtsied. She looked uncomfortable, as if Avdotya Romanovna's attention was too much for her. \n\n“Dounia, good-bye,” Raskolnikov called from the hallway. “Give me your hand.” \n\n“I already gave it to you. Have you forgotten?” Dounia said, turning to him warmly but awkwardly. \n\n“Never mind, give it to me again.” He squeezed her hand warmly. \n\nDounia smiled, blushed, pulled her hand away, and left feeling happy. \n\n“Good, that’s great,” he said to Sonia, returning to her with a bright look. “May the dead rest in peace; the living still have to live. That’s right, isn’t it?” \n\nSonia was surprised by how bright his face looked. He stared at her for a moment in silence, and memories of his dead father filled his mind.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The characters experience a mix of embarrassment and emotional connection as they say their goodbyes, highlighting their complex relationships."
