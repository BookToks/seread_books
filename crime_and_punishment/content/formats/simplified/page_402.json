  "text": "Raskolnikov looked at Svidrigaïlov with a sad expression. \n\n\"You might not be as bad as you seem,\" he said. \"I think you are a well-bred person, or at least you know how to act like one sometimes.\" \n\n\"I don't really care what people think,\" Svidrigaïlov replied, sounding a bit proud. \"So why not act silly sometimes? It can be useful, especially if that's how you are naturally,\" he added with a laugh. \n\n\"But I heard you have many friends here. You know a lot of people. Why do you want to talk to me unless you have a specific reason?\" \n\n\"That's true, I have friends here,\" Svidrigaïlov said, not really answering the question. \"I've met some of them already. I've been hanging around for the last three days and have seen them, or they’ve seen me. It's normal. I dress well and I'm not poor; the freeing of the serfs hasn't hurt me. I own mostly forests and meadows. My income is fine, but... I don't want to see them. I'm tired of them. I've been here three days and haven't visited anyone. What a strange town this is! How did it come to be? It's full of officials and students of all kinds. There’s a lot I missed when I was here eight years ago, having fun. Now, my only hope is in anatomy, I swear!\" \n\n\"Anatomy?\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov expresses his disinterest in social connections and reflects on his past while contemplating his current situation."
