  "text": "The children will sing and dance, and so will she. They will collect money and go every day under the general’s window to show everyone well-born kids whose dad was an official begging in the street. She keeps hitting the kids, and they are all crying. She is teaching Lida to sing “My Village,” the boy to dance, and Polenka the same. She is tearing up all the clothes and making them little caps like actors. She plans to carry a tin basin and make it tinkle instead of using music. She won’t listen to anything. Just think about how crazy this is! It’s unbelievable!\n\nLebeziatnikov would have said more, but Sonia, who was listening almost out of breath, grabbed her cloak and hat, and ran out of the room, putting on her things as she went. Raskolnikov followed her, and Lebeziatnikov came after him.\n\n“She has definitely gone mad!” he told Raskolnikov as they stepped into the street. “I didn’t want to scare Sofya Semyonovna, so I said ‘it seemed like it,’ but there’s no doubt. They say that in consumption, tubercles can sometimes happen in the brain; it’s too bad I don’t know anything about medicine. I tried to convince her, but she wouldn’t listen.”\n\n“Did you talk to her about the tubercles?” \n\n“Not exactly about the tubercles. Besides, she wouldn’t have understood! But what I think is that if you convince someone logically that they have nothing to cry about, they will stop crying. That’s clear. Don’t you think so?”\n\n“Life would be too easy if it were like that,” Raskolnikov replied.\n\n“Sorry, sorry; of course, it would be pretty difficult,” Lebeziatnikov said.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna is exhibiting signs of madness, causing distress among those around her."
