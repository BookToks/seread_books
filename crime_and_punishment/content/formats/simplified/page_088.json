  "text": "\"What are you doing? Are you a Christian, you jerk?\" shouted an old man in the crowd. \n\n\"Has anyone ever seen something like this? A poor horse like that pulling such a heavy load,\" said another person. \n\n\"You'll kill her,\" shouted a third person. \n\n\"Stay out of it! It's my property, and I can do what I want. Get in, more of you! Get in, all of you! I want her to run fast!\" \n\nSuddenly, laughter erupted and filled the air. The horse, hit by the blows, started to kick weakly. Even the old man couldn't help but smile at the sight of such a poor little creature trying to kick. \n\nTwo boys from the crowd grabbed whips and ran to the horse to hit her in the sides. One boy went to each side. \n\n\"Hit her in the face, in the eyes!\" shouted Mikolka. \n\n\"Let's sing, friends!\" someone in the cart called out, and everyone started singing loudly, shaking a tambourine and whistling. The woman kept cracking nuts and laughing. \n\nHe ran beside the horse, ran in front of her, and saw her being whipped across the eyes, right in the eyes! He was crying and felt like he couldn't breathe, tears streaming down his face. One of the men hit him with a whip across the face, but he didn't feel it. Wrapping his hands and screaming, he rushed to the old man with the grey beard, who was shaking his head in disapproval. A woman grabbed his hand to pull him away, but he broke free.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A crowd cruelly mocks and abuses a struggling mare, while one onlooker is overwhelmed with sorrow and desperation."
