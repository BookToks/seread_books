  "text": "\"Crime and Punishment\"\n\n\"You're not fit for this job. Well, you might as well just shoot yourself, unless you don't want to?\"  \n\"You seem to be trying to make me angry so I'll leave you.\"  \n\"What a strange guy! But here we are. Welcome to the staircase. You see, that’s the way to Sofya Semyonovna. Look, no one is home. Don't believe me? Ask Kapernaumov. She leaves the key with him. Here is Madame de Kapernaumov herself. Hey, what? She is a bit deaf. Has she gone out? Did you hear? She isn't home and probably won't be back until late tonight. Well, come to my room; you wanted to see me, right? Here we are. Madame Resslich isn’t home. She’s always busy, a good woman, I promise you... She could have helped you if you had been a bit smarter. Now, look! I’m taking this five-percent bond out of the drawer—see how many I still have—this one will be turned into cash today. I can’t waste any more time. The drawer is locked, the apartment is locked, and here we are back on the stairs. Should we take a cab? I’m going to the Islands. Want a ride? I’ll take this carriage. Oh, you refuse? You’re tired of it! Come for a drive! I think it might rain. Never mind, we can put up the hood...\"  \nSvidrigaïlov was already in the carriage. Raskolnikov thought that his worries were wrong at least for now. Without saying anything, he turned and walked back toward the Hay Market. If he had just looked back on his way, he might have seen Svidrigaïlov get out not far away, pay the cab, and walk along the sidewalk. But he had turned the corner and couldn’t see anything.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, feeling disgusted, distances himself from Svidrigaïlov, suspecting his intentions regarding his sister."
