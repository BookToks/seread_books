He killed her by accident. He meant to kill the old woman when she was alone, but then Lizaveta came in, and he killed her too.” \n\nAnother awful moment passed as they stared at each other. \n\n“You can’t guess, then?” he asked suddenly, feeling like he was jumping from a high place. \n\n“N-no…” Sonia whispered. \n\n“Take a good look.” \n\nAs soon as he said this, the same familiar feeling made his heart freeze. He looked at her and suddenly saw Lizaveta’s face in hers.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reveals to Sonia the accidental murder of Lizaveta, deepening her fear and confusion."
