Enough, go away… I can’t stand it!”\n\n“Come, Mom, just step out of the room for a minute,” Dounia whispered, worried. “We’re upsetting him, that’s clear.”\n\n“Can’t I look at him after three years?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna cried.\n\n“Wait,” he stopped them again. “You keep interrupting me, and I can’t think clearly… Have you seen Luzhin?”\n\n“No, Rodya, but he knows we’re here. We heard that Pyotr Petrovitch was kind enough to visit you today,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna added quietly.\n\n“Yes… he was so kind… Dounia, I promised Luzhin I’d throw him downstairs and told him to go to hell…”\n\n“Rodya, what are you saying! You can’t mean that…” Pulcheria Alexandrovna said in shock, but she stopped when she looked at Dounia.\n\nAvdotya Romanovna watched her brother closely, waiting to see what he would say next. They both had heard about the fight from Nastasya, as much as she could understand and share, and they were both confused and worried.\n\n“Dounia,” Raskolnikov said with effort, “I don’t want that marriage, so tomorrow you must refuse Luzhin right away, so we never have to hear his name again.”\n\n“Oh my goodness!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov insists that his sister Dounia must refuse her marriage to Luzhin, expressing his distress and desire to end the connection."
