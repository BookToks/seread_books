  "text": "A woman was standing beside a chair but didn't sit down. \n\n“Thank you,” she said, and then she sat down softly, making her dress rustle. Her light blue dress with white lace took up a lot of space in the room, and she smelled strongly of perfume. She seemed a bit embarrassed about taking up so much space and smelling so much. Her smile was both bold and shy, showing that she was nervous.\n\nFinally, the lady in black finished and got up. Suddenly, a man walked in confidently, swinging his shoulders as he walked. He tossed his fancy cap on the table and sat down in a comfortable chair. The small lady jumped up when she saw him and started curtsying happily, but he ignored her completely, and she didn't dare to sit down again while he was there. He was the assistant superintendent. He had a red moustache that stuck out, and his small features showed a bit of rudeness. He looked at Raskolnikov with annoyance because he was dressed poorly, and even though Raskolnikov felt humiliated, he still held himself with some pride. Raskolnikov stared at him for too long, making the officer feel insulted.\n\n“What do you want?” he shouted, surprised that someone so poorly dressed dared to look at him like that.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a mix of relief and embarrassment in a tense social encounter with a lady and an officer."
