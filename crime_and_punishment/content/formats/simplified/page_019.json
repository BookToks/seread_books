  "text": "Raskolnikov was not used to being around people. He usually stayed away from others, especially lately. But suddenly, he wanted to be with people. It felt like something new was happening inside him, and he craved company. After a month of feeling miserable and anxious, he just wanted to escape, even for a moment, into another world. So, even though the place was dirty, he was happy to be in the tavern.\n\nThe tavern owner was in another room but often came down the steps into the main area. You could see his bright, worn-out boots before you saw him. He wore a big coat and a greasy black vest with no tie, and his face looked oily. At the counter stood a boy about fourteen years old, and a younger boy helped by passing out things. On the counter, there were some sliced cucumbers, pieces of dry black bread, and some badly chopped fish, all smelling terrible. It was so stuffy that just five minutes in there could make someone feel drunk.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, weary from isolation, feels an unexpected desire for company while in a filthy tavern."
