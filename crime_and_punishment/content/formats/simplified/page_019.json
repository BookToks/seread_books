  "text": "Raskolnikov wasn't used to being around a lot of people. He usually stayed away from others, especially lately. But suddenly, he wanted to be with people. He felt something new inside him and had a strong urge to be around others. After a month of feeling miserable and anxious, he just wanted to escape, even for a little while, into a different world. Despite the dirty place, he was happy to be in the tavern.\n\nThe owner of the tavern was in another room but often came down the steps into the main area. You could see his bright red boots before you saw the rest of him. He wore a long coat and a really dirty black vest with no tie, and his face looked greasy. Behind the counter, there was a boy around fourteen years old, and another younger boy who helped by giving out what people asked for. On the counter, there were some sliced cucumbers, pieces of dry black bread, and small bits of fish, all smelling really bad. It was very stuffy and filled with strong alcohol smells, so being there for just five minutes could make someone feel drunk.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, weary from isolation, feels a sudden desire for company despite the unpleasantness of his surroundings."
