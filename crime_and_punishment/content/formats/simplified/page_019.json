  "text": "Raskolnikov usually didn't like being around people and avoided socializing, especially lately. But suddenly, he wanted to be with others. He felt something changing inside him and had a strong need for company. After a month of feeling miserable and anxious, he just wanted to escape, even if just for a moment, to a different place. So, even though the tavern was dirty, he was happy to stay there.\n\nThe tavern owner was in another room but often came down the steps into the main area. You could see his bright, tarred boots before you saw him. He wore a long coat and a greasy black vest with no tie, and his face looked oily. Behind the counter was a boy around fourteen, and another younger boy helped by getting things people wanted. On the counter, there were some sliced cucumbers, pieces of stale black bread, and some smelly chopped fish. It was very stuffy, and the strong smell of alcohol made it feel like you could get drunk just by being there for a few minutes.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, weary from isolation, feels a sudden desire for company despite the unpleasantness of his surroundings in a tavern."
