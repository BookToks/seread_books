It’s terrible to feel this way! What is happening to me? Where are the crosses?\n\nHe seemed lost and couldn’t focus on anything. His thoughts were racing, and he spoke in a confused way. His hands shook a little.\n\nWithout saying anything, Sonia took out two crosses from a drawer, one made of cypress wood and one of copper. She made the sign of the cross over herself and him, then put the wooden cross around his neck.\n\n“It’s a symbol of my suffering,” he laughed. “As if I haven’t suffered enough already! The wooden cross is for peasants; the copper one belonged to Lizaveta—you’ll wear it, show me! She had it on... at that moment? I remember I also had a silver one and a little icon. I threw them back on the old woman’s neck. Those would be right for now, really, those are what I should wear… But I’m rambling and forgetting what’s important; I’m a bit forgetful. \n\nI came to warn you, Sonia, so you would know… that’s all I came for. I thought I had more to say. You wanted me to go. Well, now I’m going to prison, and you’ll get your wish. Why are you crying? You too? Don’t! Stop! Oh, how I hate all of this!”\n\nBut he felt something inside; his heart hurt as he looked at her. “Why is she sad too?” he thought.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov struggles with his emotions and the weight of his actions as he prepares to face the consequences of his choices, while Sonia offers him comfort and support."
