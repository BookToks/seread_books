  "text": "Dostoevsky was sentenced to death for a crime. After eight months in prison, he and twenty-one others were taken to Semyonovsky Square to be shot. He wrote to his brother Mihail about the experience: \"They made us wear white shirts like those condemned to die. We were tied to stakes, waiting for execution. I thought I only had a few minutes left to live. I kissed my friends Plestcheiev and Dourov and said goodbye. Then, suddenly, the soldiers played a drumbeat, and we were untied and brought back. We were told that the king had spared our lives.\" Instead of death, he was sentenced to hard labor.\n\nOne of the prisoners, Grigoryev, lost his mind as soon as he was untied and never recovered. This terrible experience had a big impact on Dostoevsky. Although his faith helped him accept his suffering, he often wrote about it. He described the pain of those condemned to die and criticized the cruelty of such punishment. After this, he spent four years in a prison in Siberia with common criminals, where he started writing 'Dead House,' and later served in a disciplinary battalion. Before his arrest, he had shown signs of a nervous illness that worsened during this time.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dostoevsky's near-execution and subsequent imprisonment profoundly influenced his writing and views on suffering and cruelty."
