  "text": "Dostoevsky was sentenced to death because of his beliefs. After eight months in prison, he and twenty-one others were taken to a square to be executed. He wrote to his brother Mihail, saying that they made them wear white shirts, which are worn by people about to be executed. They were tied to stakes, and he thought he only had a few minutes left to live. He said goodbye to his friends next to him. Suddenly, the soldiers played a drumbeat, and they were untied and taken back. They were told that the king had decided to spare their lives. Instead of death, they were sent to hard labor.\n\nOne prisoner named Grigoryev lost his mind as soon as he was untied and never got better. This terrible experience deeply affected Dostoevsky. Even though he learned to accept suffering as a part of life, he often wrote about it. He described the pain of those who were condemned and spoke against the cruelty of such punishment. After this, he spent four years in a labor camp with common criminals in Siberia, where he started writing ‘Dead House,’ and then he served in a military unit. Before his arrest, he had shown signs of a nervous illness, and it worsened into severe attacks after his imprisonment.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dostoevsky's near-execution and subsequent imprisonment profoundly influenced his writing and views on suffering and cruelty."
