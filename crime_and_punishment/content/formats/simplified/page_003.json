After eight months in prison, he and twenty-one others were taken to Semyonovsky Square to be executed. He wrote to his brother Mihail, saying that they made them wear white shirts, which were for people about to be executed. They were tied to stakes, and he thought he only had a few minutes left to live. He thought about his family and said goodbye to his friends next to him. Suddenly, the soldiers played a drumbeat, and they were untied and brought back. They were told that the king had spared their lives. Instead of death, they were sent to hard labor.\n\nOne prisoner, Grigoryev, lost his mind right after being untied and never got better. This terrible experience deeply affected Dostoevsky. Although his faith helped him accept his suffering, he often wrote about it. He described the pain of those who were condemned and pointed out how cruel it was to cause such suffering. After that, he spent four years in a harsh prison with common criminals in Siberia, where he began writing 'Dead House,' and also served in a disciplinary battalion.\n\nBefore his arrest, he had some unknown health issues, which got worse and caused him violent attacks.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dostoevsky's near-execution and subsequent imprisonment profoundly influenced his writing and views on suffering and cruelty."
