  "text": "Let Sofya Semyonovna sit next to my sister, I said I had already done that today. He got annoyed that my mother and sister didn't want to argue with me about his hints, so he started being really rude to them. Eventually, he was kicked out of the house. This happened yesterday evening. \n\nNow, please pay attention: if he had managed to prove that Sofya Semyonovna was a thief, he would have shown my mother and sister that he was right to be suspicious. He would have had a reason to be mad at me for treating my sister like Sofya Semyonovna. By attacking me, he could pretend he was protecting my sister's honor since he was engaged to her. \n\nHe might have even hoped to drive a wedge between me and my family, and possibly win their favor back. Not to mention, he wanted to get back at me personally because he knows I care about Sofya Semyonovna's honor and happiness. That's what he was aiming for! That’s how I see it. That’s the whole reason for his actions, and there can’t be any other reason! \n\nRaskolnikov ended his speech like this, and everyone listened closely, even though they interrupted him with comments. But he spoke clearly and calmly, with confidence. His strong voice and serious face made a big impact on everyone. \n\n“Yes, yes, that’s it,” Lebeziatnikov agreed happily. “That must be it, because he asked me right away if you were here as soon as Sofya Semyonovna came into our room.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov argues that Luzhin's motives are driven by spite and a desire to protect his own interests at the expense of others."
