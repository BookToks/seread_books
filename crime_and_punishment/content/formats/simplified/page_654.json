It’s not really my problem, and I can’t fix things for you, but you get what I mean.\n\n“Do you know that someone is following me?” Raskolnikov asked, looking at him curiously.\n\n“No, I don’t know anything about that,” Svidrigaïlov replied, sounding surprised.\n\n“Well, then, just leave me alone,” Raskolnikov said, frowning.\n\n“Okay, let’s leave you alone.”\n\n“You should tell me, if you came here to drink and told me to come here, why did you hide and try to leave when I looked in your window? I saw you.”\n\n“He-he! And why were you lying on your sofa with your eyes closed, pretending to be asleep when I stood at your door? I saw that too.”\n\n“I might have had… reasons. You know that.”\n\n“And I might have my reasons, but you don’t know them.”\n\nRaskolnikov rested his right elbow on the table, leaned his chin on his hand, and stared closely at Svidrigaïlov. For a whole minute, he studied his face, which had caught his attention before. It was a strange face, like a mask; white and red, with bright red lips, a light beard, and still thick light hair. His eyes were very blue, and their look was heavy and fixed. There was something really unpleasant about that handsome face, which looked surprisingly young for his age.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov and Svidrigaïlov engage in a tense conversation filled with suspicion and hidden motives."
