  "text": "Things had been said in a way that made Nikolay, who Porfiry saw through right away, unable to change Porfiry’s mind. \n\n“Even Razumihin has started to suspect! The scene in the hallway under the lamp had an effect. He rushed to Porfiry… But why did Porfiry treat him like that? What was his goal in sending Razumihin with Nikolay? He must have a plan, but what is it? A lot of time has passed since that morning—too much time—and there’s been no sign of Porfiry. That can’t be good…”\n\nRaskolnikov took his cap and left the room, still thinking. For the first time in a while, he felt clear-headed. “I need to deal with Svidrigaïlov soon; he seems to be waiting for me to approach him,” he thought. At that moment, he felt a strong anger in his tired heart, enough to think he could kill either Porfiry or Svidrigaïlov. He knew he could do it later, even if not right now.\n\n“We’ll see, we’ll see,” he told himself.\n\nBut as soon as he opened the door, he ran into Porfiry in the hallway. Porfiry was coming to see him. Raskolnikov was shocked for a moment, but only for a moment. Strangely, he wasn’t very surprised to see Porfiry and didn’t feel scared. He was just startled but quickly got ready for whatever might happen.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels a renewed clarity and determination as he contemplates settling his conflicts with Svidrigaïlov and Porfiry."
