  "text": "Svidrigaïlov was chilling in a cramped back room next to a saloon where all kinds of people were sipping tea at little tables, drowning out the loud chorus of singers. You could hear billiard balls clacking from afar. On the table in front of Svidrigaïlov, there was an open bottle and a glass half-filled with champagne. \n\nIn the room, there was also a kid with a tiny hand organ and a healthy-looking girl, about eighteen, rocking a striped skirt and a Tyrolese hat with ribbons. Despite the loud singing next door, she was belting out some old-school tune in a husky voice, accompanied by the organ.\n\n“Alright, that’s enough,” Svidrigaïlov said as Raskolnikov walked in. The girl immediately stopped and stood there, looking respectful. She had sung her heart out, but kept a serious expression.\n\n“Hey, Philip, get me a glass!” Svidrigaïlov called out.\n\n“I’m not drinking anything,” Raskolnikov replied.\n\n“Suit yourself. I wasn’t talking to you. Drink up, Katia! I’m done for today, you can go.” He poured her a full glass and handed her a yellow note.\n\nKatia downed her drink in one go, like a pro, took the note, and kissed Svidrigaïlov’s hand, which he accepted without a fuss. She left the room, and the boy followed her with the organ. Svidrigaïlov had only been in Petersburg for less than a week, but he was already acting like he owned the place; even the waiter, Philip, was practically an old buddy by now.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov encounters Svidrigaïlov in a tavern where he observes a lively yet dismal scene filled with drinking and singing."
