You keep interrupting me, but we’re just trying to figure out a song to earn some cash, something Kolya can dance to. 🎤 Our performance is totally off-the-cuff, so we need to plan it out and practice. Then, we’ll hit up Nevsky, where the crowd is way better and more upscale. \n\nLida only knows “My Village,” and that’s basic—everyone knows it. We need something fancier. Have you thought of anything, Polenka? Help your mom out! My brain's a total blank, or I’d have an idea. We can’t just sing “An Hussar.” How about we go with “Cinq sous”? I taught it to you! Since it’s in French, people will see we’re from a good family, and that’ll pull at their heartstrings. \n\nYou could also sing “Marlborough s’en va-t-en guerre” since it’s a classic lullaby in fancy homes. \n\nShe starts singing: “Marlborough s’en va-t-en guerre, Ne sait quand reviendra…” but then switches back to “Cinq sous.” \n\n“Kolya, hands on your hips, hurry up! Lida, turn the other way, and Polenka and I will sing and clap!” \n\n“Cinq sous, cinq sous, Pour monter notre menage.” \n\n*Cough-cough-cough!* “Fix your dress, Polenka, it’s slipping off your shoulders,” she says, panting from coughing. “Now let’s make sure we look good!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The characters are preparing for a street performance, discussing what song to sing to attract attention and money."
