Maybe he’s just frustrated because he has no solid proof and let it slip, or maybe he’s got some scheme up his sleeve. He seems smart enough. He might be trying to scare me by acting like he knows something. They have their own twisted psychology, man. But honestly, explaining all this is gross. Just stop!\n\nAnd it’s so insulting! I get you. But now that we’re finally being real with each other (thank goodness), I’ll admit I noticed this vibe from them a while back. Just a hint, but why even hint? Who do they think they are? If you only knew how angry I’ve been. Think about it! Just because a broke student, totally stressed and on the verge of a breakdown (remember that), who hasn’t talked to anyone in six months, is dealing with some rude cops and their nonsense; and then there’s that unexpected debt from Tchebarov, the awful heat, the crowd, and the chatter about a murder he was near—all while he’s starving. It’s no wonder he might faint! And that’s what they’re basing everything on? Seriously, screw them! \n\nIf I were you, Rodya, I’d just laugh it off or better yet, spit in their faces—like, a lot. I’d throw punches everywhere and end it right there.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses his frustration and anger towards the police's insinuations about him, feeling insulted by their lack of evidence and understanding of his circumstances."
