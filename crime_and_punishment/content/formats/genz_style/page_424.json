Even Pyotr Petrovitch was alert now. \n\n“An hour and a half ago, he came in while I was sleeping, woke me up, and introduced himself,” Raskolnikov said. “He was pretty chill and seemed confident. He really wants us to be friends. Oh, and he’s eager to meet you, Dounia. He asked me to help set it up. He has a proposal for you, and he spilled some details. Also, he mentioned that a week before her death, Marfa Petrovna left you three thousand roubles in her will. You can get the money soon.” \n\n“Thank God!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna exclaimed, crossing herself. “Pray for her soul, Dounia!” \n\n“It’s true!” Luzhin chimed in. \n\n“Tell us more!” Dounia pressed Raskolnikov. \n\n“Then he mentioned he’s not rich, and all the estate goes to his kids, who are with an aunt. He said he’s staying somewhere nearby, but I didn’t ask where…” \n\n“But what does he want to propose to Dounia?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked, clearly worried. “Did he tell you?” \n\n“Yes.” \n\n“What was it?” \n\n“I’ll tell you later.” \n\nRaskolnikov stopped talking and focused on his tea. \n\nPyotr Petrovitch glanced at his watch. “I have a business meeting, so I won’t interrupt,” he said, sounding a bit annoyed.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reveals to Dounia and their mother that Mr. Svidrigaïlov wishes to propose something to her and mentions an inheritance left to Dounia."
