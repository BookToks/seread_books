Like, remember a year and a half ago when he shocked me to my core with the idea of marrying that girl—what was her name? Oh right, his landlady’s daughter?\n\n“Did you hear about that?” Avdotya Romanovna asked.\n\n“Do you really think my tears, my begging, my sickness, or even my potential death from heartbreak would stop him?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna said, sounding heated. “No way! He’d just brush aside all the problems. And it’s not like he doesn’t care about us!”\n\n“I’ve never heard him mention that whole thing,” Razu mihn replied carefully. “But I did catch some info from Praskovya Pavlovna, and she’s not one for gossip. What I heard was pretty odd.”\n\n“What did you hear?” both women asked at the same time.\n\n“Nothing too crazy. I found out that the marriage didn’t happen because the girl died, and Praskovya Pavlovna wasn’t a fan of it. They say the girl wasn’t pretty—actually, she was said to be pretty ugly... and sickly and kind of strange. But she must have had some good traits or it wouldn’t make sense. She had no money, so he definitely wasn’t after her cash. But, honestly, it’s tough to judge these things.”\n\n“I bet she was a good person,” Avdotya Romanovna said quickly.\n\n“God forgive me, but I was actually relieved when she died.” 😬\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The conversation reveals the family's concern over a past failed marriage proposal and the complexities of love and sacrifice within their relationships."
