  "text": "Svidrigaïlov was led to a cramped little room at the end of the corridor, tucked under the stairs. All the other rooms were taken. The shabby guy at the door looked at him expectantly.\n\n“Is there tea?” Svidrigaïlov asked.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“What else you got?”\n\n“Veal, vodka, snacks.”\n\n“Just bring me tea and veal.”\n\n“Nothing else?” the guy asked, surprised.\n\n“Nothing, nothing,” Svidrigaïlov replied, waving him off. \n\nThe guy left, looking let down. \n\n“This place must be something,” Svidrigaïlov thought. “How did I not know about it? I probably look like I just came from some wild café and had a crazy adventure. I wonder who else stays here?”\n\nHe lit a candle and checked out the room. It was so low that he could barely stand up. There was one window, a really dirty bed, and a plain chair and table that took up most of the space. The walls looked like they were made of planks, covered in shabby, torn paper. The color was mostly yellow, but the pattern was totally faded. One wall sloped down because of the ceiling, but this wasn’t an attic—just a weird spot under the stairs.\n\nSvidrigaïlov set the candle down, plopped onto the bed, and started to think. But a strange, constant noise from the next room kept pulling his attention.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov reflects on his surroundings in a cramped, shabby room while waiting for tea and veal."
