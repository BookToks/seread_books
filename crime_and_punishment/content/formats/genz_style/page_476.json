  "text": "Raskolnikov, youâ€™re finally here! Iâ€™m so glad you stopped by. I see you as a visitor, nothing more. And about my laughterâ€”sorry about that! Rodion Romanovitch, right? You really got me with your sharp comments; sometimes I laugh so hard it feels like I might explode! ðŸ˜… Honestly, I worry I might just have a meltdown. Please, sit down. If you donâ€™t, Iâ€™ll think youâ€™re mad at me.\n\nRaskolnikov stayed quiet, watching Porfiry with a serious frown. He eventually sat down but kept holding his cap. \n\nHereâ€™s the thing, Rodion: Iâ€™m a bachelor, nothing special, and Iâ€™m not used to being around people. I feel like Iâ€™m just fading away. Have you noticed that in our Petersburg circles, when two smart guys like us meet but arenâ€™t close, it takes forever to find something to talk about? We just sit there, all awkward. \n\nEveryone else seems to have topics ready to goâ€”especially the ladies in high society. But for us middle-class thinkers? We end up tongue-tied. Why is that? Is it because we lack public interest, or are we just too honest to pretend? I really donâ€™t know.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry Petrovitch expresses his awkwardness in social interactions, highlighting the difficulty of conversation between intelligent but unfamiliar individuals."
