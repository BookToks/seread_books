He came here two nights in a row to see Sofya Semyonovna. I showed you where they sat. He confessed everything to her. He’s a murderer. He killed an old woman, a pawnbroker, the same one he pawned stuff to. He also killed her sister, Lizaveta, who walked in while he was at it. He used an axe he brought with him. He did it to rob them, and he did rob them. Took money and other stuff… He told Sofya all this, word for word. She’s the only one who knows his secret. But she had nothing to do with the murder; she was just as shocked as you are now. Don’t worry, she won’t spill.”  \n“It can’t be,” Dounia whispered, her face pale. She struggled to breathe. “It can’t be. There was no reason, no motive… It’s a lie, a total lie!”  \n“He robbed her, that was the reason. He took money and things. Sure, he said he didn’t use any of it and just hid it under a stone, where it still is. But that’s because he was too scared to use it.”  \n“How could he steal? How could he even think of that?” Dounia exclaimed, jumping up from her chair. “You know him! You’ve seen him. Can he really be a thief?”  \nShe looked at Svidrigaïlov, desperate, completely forgetting her fear.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia is horrified to learn that a man she knows has confessed to murdering a pawnbroker and her sister for robbery."
