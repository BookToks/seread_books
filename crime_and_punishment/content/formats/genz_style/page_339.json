She told me to thank you for helping us yesterday. Without you, we wouldn’t have had anything for the funeral.’  \n\nSuddenly, Sonia’s lips and chin started to tremble, but she quickly regained her composure, looking down again.  \n\nRaskolnikov studied her closely. She had a really thin, pale face—kind of irregular and angular—with a sharp nose and chin. Not exactly pretty, but her blue eyes were super clear. When they lit up, there was a warmth and simplicity in her expression that drew you in. Despite being eighteen, she looked almost like a little girl, and some of her gestures seemed a bit silly because of that.  \n\n‘But can Katerina Ivanovna really pull this off with such tight funds? Is she even planning a funeral lunch?’ Raskolnikov asked, keeping the conversation going.  \n‘The coffin will be simple, of course, and everything else too, so it won’t cost much. Katerina Ivanovna and I have figured it all out to make sure there’s enough left.’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia informs Raskolnikov about the funeral arrangements and expresses gratitude for his previous help, revealing her emotional struggle."
