  "text": "There are times when women seem super upset about being insulted, but deep down, they actually enjoy it. Crazy, right? It’s not just them, though; people in general kind of thrive on insults. But yeah, it’s especially true for women. You could say it’s like their go-to entertainment. 🎭\n\nAt one point, Raskolnikov thought about just getting up and leaving the chat. But his curiosity (and a bit of caution) kept him there for a bit longer. \n\n“You like to fight?” he asked, playing it cool.\n\n“Not really,” Svidrigaïlov replied, chill as ever. “Marfa Petrovna and I hardly ever fought. We got along pretty well, and she was usually happy with me. I only used the whip twice in our seven years together (not counting a third time that was... complicated). The first time was two months after we got married, right when we moved to the country, and the last time was the one we’re talking about. Did you think I was some kind of monster or a total tyrant? Ha! \n\nBy the way, remember that nobleman a few years back who got roasted in the papers for hitting a German woman on a train? That was a big deal. It was during that time of “helpful publicity” (remember the whole ‘Egyptian Nights’ thing? The dark eyes? Good times, right?). Anyway, I don’t feel sorry for the guy who hit the German.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov suggests that women often enjoy being insulted despite their outward indignation, reflecting on human nature and personal experiences."
