You know how women are!” \n\n“Not at all! I didn’t mean that! Quite the opposite!” Razumihin shouted, clearly upset.\n\n“Was that okay? Was it too much? Did I go overboard?” Raskolnikov thought, feeling anxious. “Why did I say that about women?”\n\n“Oh, your mom is with you?” Porfiry asked.\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“When did she arrive?”\n\n“Last night.”\n\nPorfiry paused, seeming to think it over. “Your stuff wouldn’t be lost anyway,” he continued, cool and calm. “I’ve been expecting you here for a while.”\n\nAs if it was no big deal, he offered the ashtray to Razumihin, who was carelessly dropping cigarette ash on the carpet. Raskolnikov flinched, but Porfiry didn’t seem to notice him and kept his focus on Razumihin’s cigarette.\n\n“What? Expecting him? Did you know he had stuff there?” Razumihin exclaimed.\n\nPorfiry turned to Raskolnikov. “Your things, the ring and the watch, were wrapped together, and your name was clearly written in pencil on the paper, along with the date you left them.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels anxious and self-conscious during a conversation with Porfiry and Razumihin about a lost watch and his mother's presence."
