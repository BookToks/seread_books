  "text": "I need to ask you, Sofya Semyonovna, to come here. Honestly, it’s not safe to give Katerina Ivanovna money directly. Just look at today’s dinner as proof. She has no food for tomorrow—no bread, no shoes, nothing! Yet, she bought Jamaica rum, Madeira, and coffee. I saw it when I walked by. Tomorrow, they’ll be back to having nothing. It’s ridiculous. We should raise some money so that the poor widow doesn’t know about it, but you do. Sound good?\n\n“I don’t know… this is just today, a one-time thing. She wanted to honor someone and celebrate their memory. She’s sensible, but you’re right, and I’ll be very… they’ll all be… and God will reward… and the orphans…”\n\nSonia started crying.\n\n“Okay, keep that in mind. Now, will you take this small amount I can spare for your family? I really want my name to stay out of it. Here… I have my own worries, so I can’t give more…”\n\nPyotr Petrovitch handed Sonia a ten-rouble note, carefully unfolded. Sonia blushed, jumped up, mumbled something, and started to leave. Pyotr Petrovitch walked her to the door, and she left the room, feeling shaken and upset.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pyotr Petrovitch expresses concern about Katerina Ivanovna's reckless spending despite her dire financial situation and offers Sonia a small sum to help."
