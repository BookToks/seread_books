  "text": "Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov lives there. He always found the funniest books. I told him, “I can’t stay,” because I wasn't in the mood to read. I just wanted to show Katerina Ivanovna some collars. Lizaveta, the pedlar, sold me some cute, new embroidered collars and cuffs for cheap. Katerina Ivanovna loved them. She tried them on, looked in the mirror, and was thrilled. “Please make me a present of them, Sonia,” she said. She really wanted them. \n\nWhen could she wear them? They reminded her of happier times. She admired herself in the mirror, but she had no clothes of her own—not in years! She never asks anyone for anything; she's too proud. She’d rather give away everything. But these? She wanted them so much. I felt bad saying no. “What use are they to you, Katerina Ivanovna?” I asked. I shouldn’t have said that! The look she gave me was heartbreaking. She was so upset—not just about the collars, but because I refused her. It was painful to watch. \n\nIf only I could take back those words! If only I could change it all! But it’s whatever to you! \n\n“Did you know Lizaveta, the pedlar?” \n\n“Yeah… Did you know her?” Sonia asked, surprised. \n\n“Katerina Ivanovna has rapid consumption. She’s going to die soon,” Raskolnikov said after a pause, ignoring her question. \n\n“Oh no, no, no!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna, suffering from rapid consumption, longs for a simple joy in receiving a gift of collars, highlighting her pride and the sadness of her situation."
