Anything that helps people is honorable. I only care about one thing: useful! You can laugh all you want, but that’s the truth!’\n\nPyotr Petrovitch chuckled loudly. He finished counting the cash and started putting it away. But he left some bills on the table. The “cesspool question” had already sparked debates between them. It’s wild that it actually made Lebeziatnikov mad, while Luzhin found it funny and wanted to get under his friend’s skin.\n\n“It’s your bad luck from yesterday that’s making you so grumpy,” Lebeziatnikov shot back. Even with his so-called “independence” and “protests,” he didn’t dare oppose Pyotr Petrovitch and still treated him with some respect from the old days.\n\n“Let me ask you this,” Pyotr Petrovitch cut in, clearly annoyed. “Are you close enough with that girl to ask her to come in here for a minute? I think everyone’s back from the cemetery… I heard footsteps. I want to see her.”\n\n“Why?” Lebeziatnikov asked, surprised.\n\n“Oh, I just want to. I’m leaving today or tomorrow, so I wanted to talk to her about… Anyway, you can stay for the chat. It’s probably better that you do, honestly. Who knows what might happen?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pyotr Petrovitch expresses disdain for traditional notions of honor, emphasizing that only usefulness defines human activity."
