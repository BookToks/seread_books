  "text": "The morning was a total mess for Pyotr Petrovitch. One annoyance after another piled up. First, he hit a snag in his legal case at the senate. Then, the flat he rented for his upcoming wedding became a headache. The owner, a wealthy German trader, refused to let him break the lease and demanded the full penalty. Pyotr had already started redecorating it at his own cost! \n\nThe upholsterers were no better; they wouldn’t refund a single rouble for the furniture he bought but hadn’t moved in yet. “Am I really getting married just for the furniture?” he thought, grinding his teeth. But then a flicker of desperate hope sparked in him. “Is it really all over? Should I try one more time?” The thought of Dounia hit him hard, mixing pain with desire. If he could’ve taken Raskolnikov out in that moment just by wishing, he would’ve done it without a second thought.\n\n“It was my fault for not giving them money,” he realized as he trudged back to Lebeziatnikov’s place. “Why did I have to be so stingy? That was dumb! I thought if I kept them broke, they’d rely on me. But look at this mess! If I’d just spent around fifteen hundred roubles on their trousseau, gifts, and all that stuff from Knopp’s and the English shop, I’d be in a better spot now.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pyotr Petrovitch grapples with the consequences of his failed engagement and the financial burdens that accompany it."
