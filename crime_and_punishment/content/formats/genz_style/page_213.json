Even with a few grey strands, his styled hair didn’t make him look dumb, like how curled hair can sometimes scream “wedding day German.” But there was something off-putting about his otherwise decent-looking face, and it wasn’t just the hair. After giving Mr. Luzhin an unfiltered look, Raskolnikov smirked, flopped back on his pillow, and stared up at the ceiling again.\n\nMr. Luzhin, however, was determined to ignore the weird vibes. \n\n“I really regret seeing you like this,” he said, breaking the awkward silence. “If I’d known you were sick, I would’ve come sooner. But you know how it is with business. I’ve got a big legal thing going on in the Senate, plus other stuff you can guess. Your mom and sister should be here any minute.”\n\nRaskolnikov shifted, looking like he wanted to say something, his face showing some tension. Luzhin paused, waiting for him to speak, but when nothing came, he continued.\n\n“… They’ll be here any minute. I’ve found them a place to stay when they arrive.”\n\n“Where?” Raskolnikov asked weakly.\n\n“Very close by, in Bakaleyev’s house.”\n\n“That’s in Voskresensky,” Razumihin chimed in.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov observes Mr. Luzhin's peculiar appearance and demeanor while feeling excitement about the impending arrival of his mother and sister."
