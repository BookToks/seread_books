She looked surprised and super shy, as usual. New people always made her nervous—she was like that as a kid, and it hadn’t changed. Pyotr Petrovitch greeted her with a polite but slightly teasing vibe, thinking it was fitting for someone like him to act that way with someone so young and intriguing. He quickly tried to make her feel at ease and had her sit down across from him at the table. \n\nSonia took a seat, glancing around—first at Lebeziatnikov, then at the cash on the table, and finally back at Pyotr Petrovitch, her gaze glued to him. Lebeziatnikov moved toward the door, but Pyotr Petrovitch gestured for Sonia to stay put and stopped him.\n\n“Is Raskolnikov in there? Did he arrive?” he whispered.\n\n“Raskolnikov? Yeah, he’s here. I saw him come in. Why?” \n\n“Well, I really need you to stick around and not leave me alone with this… young woman. I just want a few words with her, but who knows how it could go. I wouldn’t want Raskolnikov to hear anything. You get what I mean?” \n\n“I get it!” Lebeziatnikov nodded, catching on. “Yeah, you’re right.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pyotr Petrovitch expresses his desire to speak privately with Sonia while ensuring Raskolnikov does not overhear their conversation."
