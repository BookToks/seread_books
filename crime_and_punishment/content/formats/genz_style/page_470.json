  "text": "**Chapter V**\n\nThe next morning at eleven sharp, Raskolnikov walked into the criminal investigation department and sent his name to Porfiry Petrovitch. He was shocked at how long he had to wait—at least ten minutes. He thought they’d jump on him right away. Instead, he stood in the waiting room, watching people pass by who clearly had nothing to do with him. \n\nIn the office next door, clerks were busy writing. They didn’t seem to have a clue who Raskolnikov was. He felt uneasy, glancing around, half expecting some guard to be watching him, ready to stop him from bolting. But there was nothing like that. Just clerks focused on their boring tasks and random folks coming and going. No one seemed to care about him at all. \n\nThe longer he waited, the more he convinced himself that if that mysterious guy from yesterday had really seen everything, they wouldn’t have left him hanging like this. They wouldn’t have waited until he decided to show up at eleven. Either the guy hadn’t reported anything, or he simply didn’t know anything (and how could he?). So, all that had happened to him...\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov anxiously waits at the investigation department, feeling paranoid about being observed while questioning whether anyone knows of his involvement in a crime."
