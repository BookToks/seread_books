  "text": "Although she paid him back (I have proof), she still talks about him with tears in her eyes. She brings him up to me, and honestly, I’m glad she thinks of herself as having been happy, even if it’s just in her head. After his death, she was left with three kids in a remote area where I happened to be. The poverty was so bad that even with all my ups and downs, I can’t even describe it. Her family had completely abandoned her. And she was super proud—too proud.\n\nThen, I stepped in. I was a widower with a 14-year-old daughter from my first marriage, and I couldn’t just watch her suffer. You can imagine how desperate things were for her—a woman with education and a good background agreeing to marry me. But she did! Crying and wringing her hands, she said yes because she had nowhere else to go. Do you get what that means? When you have absolutely nowhere to turn? I don’t think you do yet.\n\nFor a whole year, I did my best to support her and didn’t touch this (he tapped the jug), because I have feelings. But even then, I couldn’t make her happy. Then I lost my job—not my fault, just office changes. That’s when I started drinking. It’s been almost a year and a half since we finally ended up in this amazing capital, filled with countless monuments. Here we are.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The speaker recounts the hardships and sacrifices of his wife, who married him out of desperation despite her proud background and education."
