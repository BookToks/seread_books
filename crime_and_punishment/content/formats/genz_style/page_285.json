That’s just silly!” he exclaimed. “If you stay, even as his mom, you’ll drive him nuts, and who knows what could happen! Here’s the plan: Nastasya will stay with him, and I’ll take you both home. You shouldn’t be out alone; Petersburg can be a dangerous place. \n\nBut listen! I’ll run back here in a bit, and I promise I’ll give you updates on how he’s doing—if he’s asleep or whatever. Then, I’ll dash home—I’ve got tons of friends there, all partying. I’ll grab Zossimov—the doctor taking care of him. He’s there too, but he’s sober! I’ll bring him to Rodya, and then to you, so you’ll get real info straight from the doctor. That’s way better than my take on it! \n\nIf anything’s wrong, I swear I’ll bring you back myself. But if he’s fine, you can hit the hay. I’ll crash here in the hallway; he won’t even notice me. I’ll tell Zossimov to sleep at the landlady’s, just in case. Who’s better for him: you or the doctor? So let’s head home! But the landlady is a no-go; she wouldn’t let you stay because she’s… well, she’s a bit of a nut. She’d be jealous of Avdotya Romanovna and you, just so you know. She’s just completely unhinged.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin insists on taking Raskolnikov's mother and sister home for their safety while promising to check on him and bring back the doctor."
