Right?” Svidrigaïlov smirked. “Well, imagine I was thinking the same thing on my way here—hoping you’d spill something new and I could gain something from it! Look at us, rich in our own ways!”  \n\n“What could you gain?”  \n“Who knows? I mean, look where I hang out. It’s not exactly fancy. But hey, you gotta sit somewhere, right? That poor girl Katia—you saw her? If I were a total foodie, it’d be different, but I can only eat this.”  \nHe pointed to a small table in the corner with the leftover mess of a sad-looking beef steak and potatoes on a tin dish.  \n\n“By the way, have you eaten?

I don’t drink much—only champagne, really, and not more than that.” 🍾\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov expresses his interest in Raskolnikov as a subject of observation due to his connection to a person of interest and the complexity of their interaction."
