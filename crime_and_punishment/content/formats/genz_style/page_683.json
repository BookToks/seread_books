I don’t have my own place; Sofya Semyonovna’s room is right next to mine. The whole floor is rented out. Why are you acting scared like a kid? Am I really that intimidating?\n\nSvidrigaïlov smiled, but it wasn't genuine. His heart was racing, and he was struggling to breathe. He spoke louder to mask his nerves.
