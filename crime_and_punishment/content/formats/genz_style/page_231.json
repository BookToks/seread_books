His face was flushed from the champagne he’d downed. \n\n“What, you here?” he exclaimed, acting like they were old pals. “Razumihin told me just yesterday you were out cold. How weird! And guess what? I came to check on you!” \n\nRaskolnikov knew he’d show up. He put down the papers and turned to Zametov, wearing a smile that barely hid his annoyance. \n\n“I know you did,” he replied. “I heard you were looking for my sock. And guess what? Razumihin has a crush on you! He said you went to Luise Ivanovna’s place together. You know, the woman you tried to help? You winked at the Explosive Lieutenant, but he totally missed it. Remember that? How could he not get it? It was obvious!” \n\n“What a hothead he is!” \n\n“The explosive one?” \n\n“No, your buddy Razumihin.” \n\n“You must have a great life, Mr. Zametov—free entry to all the best spots. Who’s been pouring champagne down your throat?” \n\n“We just had a drink together… You’re the one talking about pouring it!” \n\n“Just a little tip! You’re cashing in on everything!” Raskolnikov laughed and playfully slapped Zametov on the back.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov encounters Zametov in a restaurant, revealing a mix of humor and irritation in their conversation."
