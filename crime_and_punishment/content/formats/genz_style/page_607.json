  "text": "Thanks to the official's help, they got Katerina Ivanovna moved. The policeman even pitched in to carry her. She was almost out cold when they laid her on Sonia's bed. Blood was still oozing, but she seemed to be coming around. Raskolnikov, Lebeziatnikov, and the official followed Sonia into the room. The policeman shooed away the crowd that had trailed them to the door.\n\nPolenka came in, holding Kolya and Lida, both shaking and crying. A few others from the Kapernaumovs’ room joined in too—like the landlord, a limping one-eyed guy with wild hair and whiskers, his wife who always looked scared, and a bunch of wide-eyed kids. Then, out of nowhere, Svidrigaïlov showed up. Raskolnikov was surprised; he hadn’t seen him in the crowd.\n\nThey mentioned a doctor and a priest. The official whispered to Raskolnikov that it might be too late for the doctor, but he still ordered one to be called. Kapernaumov took off to get him.\n\nMeanwhile, Katerina Ivanovna was catching her breath. The bleeding had slowed down. She looked at Sonia with sick but sharp eyes. Sonia was pale and trembling, wiping sweat off her forehead. Finally, Katerina asked to sit up. They propped her up on the bed.\n\n“Where are the kids?” she asked weakly. “Did you bring them, Polenka? Oh, those silly kids! Why did you run?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna is carried to Sonia's room, where she regains consciousness and inquires about her children amidst a gathering crowd."
