He had a fierce, crestfallen look that was pretty hilarious and totally justified Raskolnikov’s giggles. \n\nWithout waiting for an intro, Raskolnikov bowed to Porfiry Petrovitch, who stood in the middle of the room, looking at them with curiosity. He reached out to shake hands, still trying hard to keep a straight face and say something serious. But just as he managed to get serious, he caught a glimpse of Razumihin and lost it again. His laughter erupted, even louder because he was trying to hold it back. \n\nRazumihin’s fierce reaction to Raskolnikov’s laughter made everything feel even more genuine and fun. He added to the chaos on purpose. \n\n“Fool! You fiend!” he yelled, waving his arm, which accidentally knocked over a little round table with an empty tea glass. Everything went flying and crashing. \n\n“But why break chairs, guys?
