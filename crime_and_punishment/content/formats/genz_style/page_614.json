  "text": "Raskolnikov couldn’t shake thoughts of Svidrigaïlov. After those creepy words in Sonia’s room when Katerina Ivanovna died, his mind felt like it was glitching. Even though this freaked him out, he wasn’t rushing to figure it out. \n\nSometimes, he’d find himself in a rundown diner, lost in thought, not even sure how he got there. Then, bam! He’d suddenly think of Svidrigaïlov. It hit him hard that he needed to sort things out with that guy and figure out some kind of deal. One day, while wandering outside the city, he seriously thought they had planned to meet there, like he was waiting for Svidrigaïlov. Another time, he woke up before dawn, sprawled under some bushes, confused about how he ended up there.\n\nIn the days following Katerina Ivanovna’s death, he ran into Svidrigaïlov a couple of times at Sonia’s place. They exchanged a few words but avoided the big topic, like they had an unspoken agreement to keep it quiet for now. Katerina Ivanovna’s body was still in the coffin, and Svidrigaïlov was busy organizing the funeral. Sonia was swamped too. At their last chat, Svidrigaïlov told Raskolnikov he had made a solid plan for Katerina Ivanovna’s kids, thanks to some connections he had.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov grapples with his troubled thoughts about Svidrigaïlov following Katerina Ivanovna's death, recognizing the need for a confrontation."
