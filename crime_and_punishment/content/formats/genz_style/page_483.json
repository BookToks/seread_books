  "text": "Youâ€™re still young, right? So you think intellect is everything, just like most young folks do. You get all caught up in clever jokes and abstract ideas. Itâ€™s like those old Austrian military guys who thought they could beat Napoleon on paper. They planned it out perfectly, but guess what? General Mack surrendered with his whole army! ðŸ˜‚ \n\nI know, I know, you're probably laughing at a civilian like me using military history as an example. But hey, I canâ€™t help itâ€”I love military science! Honestly, I shouldâ€™ve been in the army. I might not have been a Napoleon, but I couldâ€™ve been a major, for sure! \n\nNow, letâ€™s get real for a second, Rodion Romanovitch. Actual facts and a personâ€™s temperament are huge deals. They can totally mess up even the sharpest calculations! Listen to me, Iâ€™m being serious here. I might not look it, but Iâ€™m not that oldâ€”just thirty-fiveâ€”but I feel like Iâ€™ve aged a bit. My voice even sounds different. \n\nAnyway, Iâ€™m a pretty honest guy. Would you say I am? I think I am. Iâ€™m sharing all this with you for free; no strings attached! ðŸ˜„ So, about witâ€”itâ€™s a fantastic thing, really. It adds flair to life and can pull some amazing tricks. But sometimes, it makes things tricky for an examiner like me!\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The speaker reflects on the deceptive nature of wit and intellect, emphasizing the importance of actual facts and human temperament over clever arguments."
