  "text": "You’re just lying out of stubbornness, trying to stand your ground against me. You can’t really respect Luzhin. I’ve met him and talked to him. So, you’re basically selling yourself for cash, and that’s pretty low. At least you can feel embarrassed about it. \n\n“That’s not true! I’m not lying!” Dounia shot back, losing her cool. “I wouldn’t marry him unless I was sure he respects me and thinks highly of me. I wouldn’t marry him if I didn’t believe I could respect him. Luckily, I’ll have proof of that today... And marrying him isn’t the disgrace you claim! Even if you were right and I was planning something terrible, is it fair to talk to me like this? Why do you expect me to be a hero when maybe you’re not one either? That’s just controlling and cruel. If I mess up, it’s only my life I’m ruining. I’m not committing murder. Why are you looking at me like that? Why do you look so pale? Rodya, what’s wrong?”\n\n“Oh my gosh! You’ve made him faint!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna exclaimed.\n\n“No, no, it’s nothing!

How will you get proof today that you respect him and that he respects you, like you said?” \n\n“Mom, show Rodya Pyotr Petrovitch’s letter,” Dounia insisted.\n\nWith shaky hands, Pulcheria Alexandrovna handed him the letter. He took it with keen interest, but before he could...\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia defends her decision to marry Luzhin, asserting that she respects him and is not acting basely, despite her family's concerns."
