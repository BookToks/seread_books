  "text": "Raskolnikov’s heart raced as he followed a man down a side street. “Does he know I’m behind him?” he wondered. The man entered a big building, so Raskolnikov hurried to the gate, hoping for a sign. The man glanced back and seemed to wave him in. Raskolnikov dashed into the courtyard, but the man had vanished—probably up the first staircase.\n\nHe sprinted after him, hearing slow footsteps two flights up. The staircase felt oddly familiar. He reached a first-floor window, where the moonlight spilled in, creating a gloomy vibe. Then he got to the second floor. “Wait, isn’t this where the painters were working?” he thought, puzzled. Why hadn’t he recognized it sooner? The footsteps above had stopped. “He must be hiding,” Raskolnikov thought, pushing on to the third floor. Should he keep going? The silence was unsettling.\n\nHe pressed forward, each step echoing in the dark. The man had to be lurking somewhere. Suddenly, he noticed a flat door wide open. He hesitated, then slipped inside. It was dark and empty in the hallway, like everything had been cleared out. He tiptoed into the parlor, which was bathed in moonlight. Everything looked the same—the chairs, the mirror, the yellow sofa, and the framed pictures. A massive, copper-red moon peeked through the windows. “It’s the moon creating this eerie stillness,” Raskolnikov thought, standing there, waiting… and waiting.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov follows a mysterious man into a dark, familiar building, filled with a sense of dread and anticipation."
