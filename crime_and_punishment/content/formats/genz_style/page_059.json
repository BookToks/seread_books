  "text": "Dounia wants to get a job that pays her for her work, not as a charity. I totally back her on this. We haven’t talked about our plans yet because I want you to feel equal when you meet him. When Dounia hyped you up to him, he said you can’t really judge a person without meeting them in person. He’s excited to form his own opinion about you.\n\nListen, Rodya, I’ve been thinking that maybe it’s better for me to live alone after the wedding. It’s not about Pyotr Petrovitch; it’s just my own feelings. I believe he’ll be kind and invite me to stay with Dounia, but I’ll probably say no. I’ve seen too many husbands struggle with their mothers-in-law, and I don’t want to be a burden. Plus, I’d rather be independent as long as I have my own little place and my amazing kids, you and Dounia.\n\nIf I can, I’ll settle nearby. Here’s the best news, Rodya: Dounia and I might all be together soon! We could hug again after almost three years apart! It’s definitely happening that we’re heading to Petersburg soon.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia plans to work for a salary rather than as a charity, and expresses a desire for independence after her wedding."
