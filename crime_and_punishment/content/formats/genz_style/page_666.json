  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nYou won’t believe it, but I used everything—pleas, tears, you name it. Seriously, tears! It’s wild what some girls will do for a cause. I, on the other hand, played the victim, acting like I was just desperate for enlightenment. But I pulled out the ultimate trick for winning over a woman: flattery. \n\nTruth is tough to deliver, but flattery? Super easy. If there’s even a hint of dishonesty in the truth, it creates awkwardness—and that’s a recipe for disaster. But flattery? If it’s all fake, it’s still enjoyable to hear. Sure, it might be a bit cringy, but half of it will feel true. This works across the board, no matter who you are. Even the most devoted person can fall for flattery. \n\nI can’t help but laugh when I think about how I once charmed a woman who was all about her family and values. It was such a breeze! She really did have principles—just her own. My whole strategy was to act completely submissive and worship her purity. I laid it on thick with compliments, and once I got a hand squeeze or even a glance, I’d feel guilty for “forcing” it and claim she didn’t even see my intentions coming. I’d say she was so innocent that she couldn’t help but give in without realizing it. In the end, I came out on top, while she remained blissfully unaware.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The narrator reflects on the effectiveness of flattery as a means to manipulate and seduce women, contrasting it with the difficulty of speaking the truth."
