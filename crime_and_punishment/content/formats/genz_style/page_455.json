  "text": "Sonia stood there, her head and hands hanging low, totally crushed. \n\n“Can’t you save up? You know, stash some cash for emergencies?” he asked, stopping in front of her. \n\n“No,” Sonia whispered back. \n\n“Of course not. Have you even tried?” he said, almost mocking her. \n\n“Yes,” she replied. \n\n“And it didn’t work out! No surprise there.” He started pacing again. \n\n“Don’t you get money every day?” \n\nSonia looked even more lost, her face flushing. \n\n“No,” she said, struggling to get the words out. \n\n“It’ll probably be the same for Polenka,” he said out of nowhere. \n\n“No, no! It can’t be! No!” Sonia shouted, as if he’d stabbed her. “God wouldn’t let anything that horrible happen!” \n\n“He lets other people suffer,” he shot back. \n\n“No, no! God will protect her, God!” she insisted, almost frantic. \n\n“But what if there is no God?” Raskolnikov said with a sneer, laughing as he looked at her. \n\nSonia’s expression shifted suddenly; she looked at him with deep hurt. She tried to say something but couldn’t, and then she broke down, sobbing hard while hiding her face in her hands. 😢\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia expresses her despair over the possibility of losing her loved ones, clinging to her faith in God's protection despite Raskolnikov's cynicism."
