  "text": "People were all over the place, each convinced they had the truth. They felt miserable looking at each other, beating their chests, crying, and wringing their hands. They couldn't figure out what was good or evil, who to blame, or who to defend. It was chaos—men killed each other out of pointless rage. \n\nArmies formed, but even on the move, they’d turn on one another. Soldiers would break ranks, stabbing, biting, and tearing each other apart. Alarm bells blared all day in towns, but no one knew why they were ringing or who was calling them. Regular jobs were left behind because everyone had their own ideas and couldn’t agree. The land was neglected too. \n\nGroups would gather, make promises to stick together, but then they’d immediately start doing something totally different. Accusations flew, fights broke out, and people died. Fires raged, and famine loomed. Everything and everyone was caught in destruction. The plague spread like wildfire, leaving only a few people who could be saved. They were seen as a chosen few, meant to start a new race and a fresh life, to renew and cleanse the earth. But no one had seen or heard them. \n\nRaskolnikov couldn’t shake off this crazy nightmare. The memory of that feverish delirium stuck with him for way too long.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The chaotic and destructive nature of humanity is depicted through senseless violence and the inability to agree on moral truths."
