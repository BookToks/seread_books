The guy kept his eyes down. More silence. \n\n“Why do you come looking for me and say nothing? What’s up with that?” Raskolnikov’s voice wavered. He struggled to get the words out.\n\nThen the man finally looked up, giving Raskolnikov a dark, intense stare. \n\n“Murderer!” he said, clear and cold.\n\nRaskolnikov felt weak all of a sudden. A chill raced down his spine. His heart skipped a beat, then started pounding like crazy. They kept walking in silence for about a hundred paces. \n\nThe man still wouldn’t look at him.\n\n“What do you mean? Who’s a murderer?” Raskolnikov mumbled, barely audible.\n\n“You are a murderer,” the man said, more clearly this time, a smile of cruel satisfaction on his face. He locked eyes with Raskolnikov, who looked pale and shaken.\n\nThey reached the crossroads, and the man turned away.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov encounters a man who accuses him of being a murderer, intensifying his feelings of guilt and fear."
