Why are you still here then?’\n\n‘He’s a crook!’ yelled the peasant woman.\n\n‘Why waste your breath on him?’ shouted the other porter, a big guy in a long coat with keys hanging from his belt. ‘Get lost! He’s definitely a crook. Just go!’\n\nWith that, he grabbed Raskolnikov by the shoulder and shoved him into the street. Raskolnikov stumbled but managed to stay on his feet. He glanced at the crowd in silence and walked away.\n\n‘Weird dude!’ the workman said.\n\n‘There are some strange people around these days,’ the woman added.\n\n‘You should’ve taken him to the police station anyway,’ said the man in the long coat.\n\n‘Better to just ignore him,’ decided the big porter. ‘He’s definitely trouble. Once you get involved, you won’t shake him off… we know the type!’\n\n‘Should I go there or not?’ Raskolnikov wondered, standing still at the crossroads, scanning the area like he was waiting for someone to give him a sign.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is confronted by suspicious townspeople who label him a rogue, prompting him to contemplate whether to go to the police station."
