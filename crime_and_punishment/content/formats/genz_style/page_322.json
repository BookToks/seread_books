  "text": "Raskolnikov felt like his mind was all over the place—like he was in a dream. \n\n“Maybe it’s good that he thinks I’m almost a madman,” he thought. \n\nDounia, looking worried, chimed in, “People in perfect health act weird too.” \n\nZossimov nodded, “That’s true. We all have our moments. But let’s be real: the truly mad are a bit crazier. Normal people? They’re rare. You might find one in hundreds of thousands.” \n\nEveryone frowned at the mention of “madman” from Zossimov, even though he was just chatting about his favorite topic. Raskolnikov seemed lost in thought, a strange smile on his pale face. \n\n“Hey, what about the guy who got run over?” Razumihin jumped in. \n\nRaskolnikov snapped back to reality. “Oh, right. I got blood on me when we carried him to his place. By the way, Mom, I did something really stupid yesterday. I was out of my mind. I gave away all the money you sent me… to his wife for the funeral. She’s a widow now, sick, and has three little kids starving at home. There’s even a daughter. You might have done the same if you’d seen them. But I shouldn’t have done it, especially since I know you needed that money too. To help others, you’ve got to have the right to do it, or else…”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reflects on his actions and the nature of madness while grappling with guilt over giving away money meant for his family to help a widow."
