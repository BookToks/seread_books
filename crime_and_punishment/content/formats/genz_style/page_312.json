  "text": "\"Crime and Punishment\"  \n\nDear Pulcheria Alexandrovna,  \n\nI hope you’ll accept my respectful regards for your wonderful daughter, Avdotya Romanovna.  \n\nSincerely,  \nP. Luzhin  \n\n“What am I supposed to do now, Dmitri Prokofitch?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked, nearly in tears. “How can I tell Rodya not to come? Just yesterday, he insisted we refuse Pyotr Petrovitch, and now we’re told not to let Rodya in! If he finds out, he’ll come anyway, and… what then?”  \n\n“Just go with what Avdotya Romanovna decides,” Razumihin replied calmly.  \n\n“Oh, dear! She says… who knows what she means! She doesn’t really explain! She insists Rodya must be here at eight o’clock and that they need to meet. I didn’t even want to show him the letter, but I thought maybe we could come up with a plan to keep him from coming… he gets so worked up. Plus, I don’t get what’s up with that drunk guy who died and his daughter, and how he could’ve left her all that money…”  \n\n“That money you sacrificed so much for, mother,” Avdotya Romanovna interjected.  \n\n“He wasn’t himself yesterday,” Razumihin said thoughtfully. “You wouldn’t believe what he was doing at the restaurant. There was some logic to it, though… Hm! He did mention something about a dead man and a girl on our way home, but I didn’t really get it.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pulcheria Alexandrovna is distressed about how to handle Rodya's impending visit, fearing his reaction and the implications of a letter from Pyotr Petrovitch."
