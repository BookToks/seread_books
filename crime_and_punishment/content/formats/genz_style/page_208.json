  "text": "**Crime and Punishment**  \n**Chapter V**  \n\nA not-so-young gentleman stood in the doorway, looking stiff and a bit full of himself. He was clearly shocked, scanning the room like he couldn’t believe where he was. His face showed distrust, almost like he was offended, as he took in Raskolnikov’s cramped little space. \n\nRaskolnikov was sprawled out on a dirty sofa, looking a mess—unwashed and in his pajamas—just staring back at him. The gentleman then shifted his gaze to Razumihin, who was unkempt and unshaven but met his stare without flinching. An awkward silence hung between them for a couple of minutes. \n\nRealizing he wouldn’t intimidate them into submission, the gentleman eased up a bit. He addressed Zossimov, speaking clearly and with a hint of seriousness: “Is this Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, a student, or a former student?” \n\nZossimov was about to respond, but Razumihin jumped in first.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A pompous gentleman enters Raskolnikov's cramped living space, initially shocked by the disheveled state of its occupants."
