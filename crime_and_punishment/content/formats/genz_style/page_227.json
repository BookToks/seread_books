  "text": "Raskolnikov pushed into a packed crowd of peasants. He scanned their faces, feeling a strange urge to chat. But the peasants ignored him, too busy shouting in their groups. After a moment, he turned right toward V.\n\nHe had strolled down this little street before, which angles from the market to Sadovy Street. Lately, he found himself wandering here more often when he was feeling down, which somehow made him feel even worse.\n\nAs he walked, his mind was blank. He passed a huge block of buildings filled with bars and eateries. Women rushed in and out, wearing indoor clothes and no head coverings. Groups formed on the pavement, especially around the entrances to the lively spots below. \n\nFrom one bar, loud music, guitar strumming, and laughter spilled into the street. A bunch of women gathered by the door—some sat on the steps, others stood chatting. A drunken soldier wandered nearby, cigarette in hand, cursing as if he’d lost his way. Two beggars were in a heated argument, and a completely wasted man lay sprawled across the road.\n\nRaskolnikov blended into the crowd of women, who spoke in raspy voices. They were bare-headed, dressed in cotton, and wore goatskin shoes. The crowd included women in their forties and some as young as seventeen.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov wanders through a lively district filled with peasants and women, feeling a mix of depression and curiosity."
