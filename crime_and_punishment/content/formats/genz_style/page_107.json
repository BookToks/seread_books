  "text": "His little experiment was just that—an experiment, not the real deal. It was like saying, \"Let’s just try it out—no point in just thinking about it!\" But when he actually tried, he freaked out and ran away, cursing himself. \n\nOn the moral side, he thought he had it all figured out. His reasoning was sharp, like a razor, and he couldn’t find any logical objections in himself. But deep down, he lost faith in himself. He desperately searched for arguments, as if someone was pushing him toward it.\n\nBefore all this, he was stuck on one big question: Why are most crimes so obvious and easy to solve? He came up with some intriguing ideas. He believed the main issue wasn’t just about hiding the crime; it was about the criminal. Most criminals mess up their own plans because they lose their grip on reality at the worst possible moment—when they need to be careful the most. \n\nHe thought this loss of reason hit people like a sickness. It creeps up on them, peaks right before they commit the crime, and lingers during and after, depending on the person. Then, just like any illness, it eventually fades away.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist grapples with the moral implications of crime, concluding that criminals often fail due to a temporary loss of will and reasoning, akin to a disease."
