But a policeman dashed down the steps to the canal, quickly shedding his coat and boots. The woman was close enough to reach—he grabbed her clothes with one hand and took a pole offered by a fellow officer with the other. They pulled her out right away. \n\nThey laid her on the granite pavement of the embankment. She came to, lifted her head, sat up, and started sneezing and coughing, blankly wiping her wet dress. She didn’t say a word.\n\n“She’s drunk out of her mind,” the same woman lamented nearby. “Just the other day, she tried to hang herself, and we saved her. I ran out to the shop, left my little girl to watch her, and now look where she is!” She gestured to a neighbor, saying, “We live close by, just the second house from the end, over there…”\n\nThe crowd began to disperse, but the police stayed around the woman. Someone mentioned the police station. Raskolnikov watched, feeling strangely indifferent and apathetic. Disgust washed over him. “This is disgusting… water… it’s not enough,” he muttered. “Nothing will come of this. No point in waiting. What about the police office? And where’s Zametov? The police office is open until ten…” He turned away from the railing and scanned the area.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A woman is rescued from drowning by a policeman while Raskolnikov observes with indifference and apathy."
