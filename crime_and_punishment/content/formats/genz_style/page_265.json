She forgot about her light shoes, the parasol she carried (pointless at night), and the silly straw hat with its bright feather. Under that tilted hat was a scared, pale face with parted lips and wide, terrified eyes. Sonia was an eighteen-year-old girl, small and thin, with fair hair and striking blue eyes. She focused on the bed and the priest, catching her breath after running. Finally, she heard some whispers from the crowd and took a step into the room, still close to the door.\n\nThe service had wrapped up. Katerina Ivanovna approached her husband again. The priest stepped back, ready to offer some words of comfort to Katerina Ivanovna as he left. \n\n“What am I supposed to do with these?” she snapped, pointing at the kids.\n\n“God is merciful; look to Him for help,” the priest replied.\n\n“Yeah, He’s merciful, but not to us,” she shot back.\n\n“That’s a sin, madam,” the priest said, shaking his head.\n\n“And isn’t that a sin?” Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed, gesturing at the dying man.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia, a frightened young girl, enters a room filled with tension as Katerina Ivanovna confronts a priest about her family's suffering and the dying man's fate."
