  "text": "What I did back then! Seriously, how dumb can a guy get when he's in a frenzy? Note to self: never act on impulse, Rodion Romanovitch. I realized that Avdotya Romanovna was basically struggling (sorry, not the right word, but you get it), working hard to support her mom and you. So, I thought, why not offer her all my cash—thirty thousand roubles I could’ve gotten then—if she'd just run away with me to Petersburg. Of course, I would’ve promised her forever love and all that jazz. \n\nI was so into her that if she’d asked me to poison Marfa Petrovna or something, I would’ve done it in a heartbeat! But then came the disaster you already know about. Imagine how crazy I got when I found out Marfa Petrovna was trying to set her up with that shady lawyer, Luzhin. That was basically the same thing I was suggesting. Right? You see where I’m coming from? \n\nI can tell you’re paying attention now… you interesting young man… \n\nSvidrigaïlov slammed his fist on the table, looking heated. I could see that the glass of champagne he had downed was hitting him—so I decided to use this moment. I felt wary of Svidrigaïlov. \n\n“After what you just said, I’m convinced you’ve come to Petersburg with plans for my sister,” I said.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reflects on his past impulsive decisions and feelings for Avdotya Romanovna, revealing his desperation and jealousy regarding her potential marriage to Luzhin."
