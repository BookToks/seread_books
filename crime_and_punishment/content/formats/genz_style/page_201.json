Then, just the other day, they found Nikolay at a tavern on the edge of town. He had taken off his silver cross and traded it for a drink. 🍻 \n\nA few minutes later, a woman went to the cowshed and saw through a crack that he had made a noose with his sash, stood on a block, and was trying to hang himself. She screamed, and people rushed in. ‘So this is what you’re up to!’ she shouted. ‘Take me to that police officer,’ he said. ‘I’ll confess everything.’ \n\nThey took him to the police station with an escort. They started asking him questions, like how old he was. ‘Twenty-two,’ he replied. When they asked, ‘Did you see anyone on the staircase when you were with Dmitri?’ he said, ‘Sure, people might have gone up and down, but I didn’t notice.’ \n\nThen they asked, ‘Did you hear anything unusual?’ He answered, ‘Nothing special.’ They pressed on, ‘Did you know that Widow So-and-so and her sister were murdered and robbed that day?’ He replied, ‘I didn’t know anything about that. I first heard about it from Afanasy Pavlovitch two days ago.’ \n\nNext, they asked, ‘Where did you find the earrings?’ He said, ‘On the pavement.’ They continued, ‘Why didn’t you go to work with Dmitri the other day?’ His answer was simple: ‘Because I was drinking.’ ‘Where were you drinking?’ ‘Just at this place.’ ‘Why did you run away from Dushkin’s?’ He didn’t finish that thought, but you get the idea. 🤔\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Nikolay was arrested after attempting suicide and confessed to knowing nothing about the murders he was implicated in."
