He wandered through the gateway, lost in his head.\n\n“Here he is!” a loud voice shouted.\n\nHe looked up. The porter stood at his tiny room door, pointing him out to a short guy who looked like a craftsman. This guy wore a long coat and a waistcoat, but from a distance, he kinda resembled a woman. He hunched over, his head covered by a greasy cap. With a wrinkled, saggy face, he looked over fifty. His small eyes were buried in fat, and they glared out, looking grim and unhappy.\n\n“What’s up?” Raskolnikov asked as he approached the porter.\n\nThe man glanced at him from under his brows, studying him closely. Then, without a word, he turned and walked out onto the street.\n\n“What’s going on?” Raskolnikov called after him.\n\n“The guy was asking if a student lived here. He mentioned your name and who you stayed with. I saw you coming and pointed you out, then he just left. Weird, right?” \n\nThe porter seemed a bit confused too, but not too much. After a moment of thought, he went back inside.\n\nRaskolnikov chased after the stranger and quickly spotted him walking on the opposite side of the street, moving deliberately with his eyes glued to the ground, like he was deep in thought. Raskolnikov caught up to him but hung back for a bit, following silently.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov encounters a mysterious stranger who inquires about him, leaving him puzzled and anxious."
