  "text": "Katerina Ivanovna wouldn’t let it slide. She defended Sonia, and that’s how it all started. Sonia visits us mostly at night; she tries to cheer Katerina up and gives her whatever she can. She stays at the Kapernaumovs’—a family of tailors. The dad, Kapernaumov, is lame and has a cleft palate, and so does everyone else in the family, including his wife. They all squeeze into one room, but Sonia has her own little space divided off. It’s tough for them, all living in such poverty. \n\nSo, I got up the next morning, threw on my ragged clothes, lifted my hands to the sky, and headed to see his excellency, Ivan Afanasyvitch. You don’t know him? Well, he’s a big deal—a man of God, in a way. When he heard my story, his eyes looked foggy. He said, “Marmeladov, you’ve let me down before, but I’ll give you another chance.” He told me to remember that and sent me on my way. I imagined kissing his feet—though he’d never let me do it for real since he’s a statesman with modern ideas. \n\nWhen I got home and told everyone I was back in the service with a salary, you wouldn’t believe the chaos that erupted! 😳 Just then, a bunch of drunk party-goers stumbled in, and the sounds of a concertina and a kid singing “The Hamlet” filled the room. 🎶\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marmeladov recounts his struggles and the support of Sonia and Katerina Ivanovna amidst their poverty."
