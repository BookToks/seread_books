  "text": "â€˜The time will be shortened,â€™ Raskolnikov chuckled.  \nâ€˜Are you scared of looking bad? Maybe youâ€™re worried about it without even realizing, because youâ€™re young! But seriously, donâ€™t be scared to turn yourself in and confess.â€™  \nâ€˜Ugh, whatever!â€™ Raskolnikov muttered, filled with disgust and contempt, like he didnâ€™t want to say it out loud.  \nHe got up like he was going to leave but then sat back down, clearly in despair.  \nâ€˜Go ahead, think what you want! Youâ€™ve lost faith, and you think Iâ€™m just buttering you up; but how long have you really lived? How much do you get? You had this theory, and then you felt ashamed when it fell apart and turned out to be totally unoriginal! Sure, it was a low point, but youâ€™re not completely lost. Not at all! At least you didnâ€™t fool yourself for long; you jumped straight to the worst part. How do I see you? I see you as someone who could smile at their torturer while theyâ€™re being cut open, just because they found faith or God. Find that, and youâ€™ll thrive. You really need a change of scenery. Suffering can be good too. Embrace it! Maybe Nikolay is onto something by wanting to suffer. I know you donâ€™t believe itâ€”but donâ€™t overthink it; dive straight into life without second-guessing. Donâ€™t be afraidâ€”the current will carry you to safety. What safety? Who knows? I just believe you have a long life ahead of you. I know you think Iâ€™m just reciting some speech, but maybe youâ€™ll remember this later. It could help you out. ðŸŒŠ\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is urged to confess and embrace suffering as a path to finding faith and meaning in life."
