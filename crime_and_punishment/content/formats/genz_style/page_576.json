  "text": "Sonia remembered the look on Lizaveta’s face when he approached her with the axe. She backed up against the wall, her face filled with childlike fear, like little kids do when they get scared. They stare wide-eyed at what frightens them, pulling back and holding out their hands, ready to cry. \n\nNow, Sonia was doing the same thing. With that same helplessness, she looked at him for a moment. Then, she reached out with her left hand, pressing her fingers softly against his chest. Slowly, she started to rise from the bed, moving away from him, her gaze locked on him. His fear mirrored hers. He stared back, wearing a similar childish smile. \n\n“Have you guessed?” he whispered finally.\n\n“Oh my God!” she cried out, her voice breaking. She collapsed onto the bed, burying her face in the pillows. A moment later, she sprang up, rushed to him, grabbed both his hands, and squeezed them tightly with her thin fingers. She looked into his face again, searching for any glimmer of hope. But there was none; it was all true. Later, when she thought back on that moment, she found it strange that she had instantly known there was no doubt. She couldn’t say she had predicted this outcome, but as soon as he spoke, it felt like she had somehow seen it coming.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia experiences a profound and paralyzing fear as she confronts the truth of Raskolnikov's actions."
