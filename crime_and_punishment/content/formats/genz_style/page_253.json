  "text": "An elegant carriage sat in the middle of the road, pulled by two energetic grey horses. No one was inside, and the coachman had stepped down, holding the horses by their bridles. A crowd had gathered, with police in front. One officer was shining a lantern on something near the wheels. People were talking loudly, shouting, and gasping. The coachman kept saying, “What a misfortune! Good Lord, what a misfortune!”\n\nRaskolnikov pushed through the crowd to see what was happening. On the ground lay a man who had been run over, seemingly unconscious and covered in blood. His clothes were shabby, but he didn’t look like a worker. Blood was streaming from his head and face, which was crushed and disfigured. He was clearly in bad shape.\n\n“Merciful heaven!” the coachman cried. “What more could I do? I wasn’t driving fast, and I shouted to him! I was going slowly, just like everyone else. We all know a drunk person can’t walk straight. I saw him staggering across the street, almost falling. I shouted once, twice, three times, and then I held the horses back…”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A crowd gathers around a carriage accident where a man lies badly injured and bleeding on the ground."
