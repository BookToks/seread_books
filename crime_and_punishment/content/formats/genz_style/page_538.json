  "text": "Katerina Ivanovna was clearly annoyed. She wanted everyone to think this lady was doing her a favor by being there. “I asked her, as a sensible person, to invite folks who knew my late husband. But look at the idiots she brought! The worst crowd! That one with the spotty face? Seriously? And those Poles, ha-ha-ha!” (She coughed.) “None of them have ever set foot in here. What are they even doing here? Just sitting there like a row of dummies. \n\n“Hey, you!” she shouted at one of them. “Have you tried the pancakes? Take more! Have some beer! Want some vodka?” (They looked a bit lost.) “Look at him, he’s jumping up and bowing. They must be starving, poor things. Whatever, let them eat! At least they’re quiet, though I’m a bit worried about our landlady’s silver spoons… Amalia Ivanovna!” she called out suddenly, almost shouting. “If any of your spoons go missing, don’t blame me! Ha-ha-ha!” \n\nShe laughed and turned to Raskolnikov, nodding toward the landlady, clearly enjoying herself. “She didn’t get it again! Look at her, mouth open like an owl! A real owl in fancy ribbons, ha-ha-ha!” \n\nThen her laughter turned into a terrible coughing fit that lasted a good five minutes. Sweat beaded on her forehead, and her handkerchief was stained with blood. She showed Raskolnikov the blood without saying a word, and as soon as she caught her breath, she started whispering animatedly to him, her cheeks flushed.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna expresses her disdain for the guests at her gathering, mocking their presence and the landlady's lack of understanding."
