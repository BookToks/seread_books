  "text": "Raskolnikov was outside, chilling by the riverbank. He sat on some logs, staring at the wide, empty river. From up high, he could see a huge landscape. He heard faint singing from across the water. In the sunny steppe, he spotted tiny black dots—those were nomads’ tents. That was freedom. Those people lived a totally different life, like they were stuck in the past, back in the days of Abraham and his flocks. \n\nAs he sat there lost in thought, feeling restless, Sonia appeared next to him. She had come up quietly and sat down beside him. It was still early, and the morning air was chilly. She wore her old, worn-out cloak and a green shawl. Her face looked pale and thin, showing she had been unwell. She smiled at him, but her usual shyness showed as she reached out her hand. She was always nervous about this—sometimes she wouldn’t even offer it, afraid he might reject her. \n\nHe usually took her hand with reluctance, acting annoyed to see her, and often stayed silent during her visits. Sometimes she’d leave feeling really sad. But this time, their hands stayed together. He glanced at her quickly but then looked down, not saying a word. They were alone, and no one was watching them; even the guard had turned away.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reflects on freedom and his troubled thoughts while sitting by the river, and is joined by Sonia, whose presence brings a mix of joy and tension."
