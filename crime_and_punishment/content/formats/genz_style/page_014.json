  "text": "Raskolnikov was thinking about how clean everything was. He peeked at the cotton curtain that led to another tiny room. In there was the old woman’s bed and a chest of drawers. This was the whole flat.\n\n“What do you want?” the old woman asked, looking serious and staring right at him.\n\n“I’ve got something to pawn,” he said, pulling out an old silver watch. It had a globe engraved on the back, and a steel chain.\n\n“But your last pledge is overdue. The month was up two days ago.”\n\n“I’ll bring you the interest for another month; just wait a bit.”\n\n“That’s my call, my good sir. I can wait or sell your pledge right now.”\n\n“How much for the watch, Alyona Ivanovna?”\n\n“You come with these small things, my good sir. It’s hardly worth anything. I gave you two roubles for your ring last time, and you could buy it new for a rouble and a half.”\n\n“Just give me four roubles for it. I’ll get it back; it was my father’s. I’ll have money soon.”\n\n“A rouble and a half, and you pay the interest upfront if you want!”\n\n“A rouble and a half!” the young man exclaimed, frustrated.\n\n“Suit yourself,” she said, handing the watch back. He took it, feeling really angry. 😤\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov attempts to pawn a silver watch but is met with the old woman's harsh refusal and undervaluation of his item."
