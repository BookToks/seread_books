  "text": "Raskolnikov noticed how clean everything was and glanced at the cotton curtain covering the door to the other tiny room, where the old woman’s bed and chest of drawers were. This was the whole flat. \n\n“What do you want?” the old woman asked sharply, stepping into the room and staring him down.\n\n“I’ve got something to pawn,” he said, pulling out an old silver watch with a globe engraved on the back. The chain was steel. \n\n“But your last pawn is overdue. It was due two days ago,” she replied.\n\n“I’ll pay the interest for another month. Just wait a bit.”\n\n“That’s my call. I can wait or sell your stuff right now.” \n\n“How much for the watch, Alyona Ivanovna?” \n\n“You come with these little things. It’s hardly worth anything. Last time, I gave you two roubles for your ring, and you could buy it new for a rouble and a half.” \n\n“Just give me four roubles for it. I’ll get it back soon; it was my dad’s.” \n\n“A rouble and a half, plus interest upfront, if you want!” \n\n“A rouble and a half?” he exclaimed, shocked. \n\n“Suit yourself,” she said, handing the watch back. He took it, furious.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov attempts to pawn a silver watch but is met with the old woman's refusal and low offer, leading to his frustration."
