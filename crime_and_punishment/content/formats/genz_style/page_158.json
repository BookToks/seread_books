Not even Nastasya had touched anything. But seriously, how could he have left all that stuff in the corner? \n\nHe rushed over, slid his hand under the paper, and pulled out the items. He stuffed them into his pockets. There were eight things total: two small boxes—maybe earrings?—but he didn’t really check. Then four little leather cases. There was also a chain wrapped in newspaper and something else that looked like a decoration. He crammed everything into his overcoat pockets and his trouser pocket, trying to hide them as best as he could. He grabbed the purse too. \n\nThen he stepped out, leaving the door wide open. He walked fast and determined, even though he felt wrecked. He was on high alert. He feared pursuit—what if, in half an hour, they sent someone after him? He had to hide all evidence before that happened. He needed to sort everything out while he still had some strength and clarity. \n\nBut where to go? \n\nThat was already decided: “Just toss them into the canal.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov frantically searches his room for stolen items, fearing discovery and contemplating how to dispose of them."
