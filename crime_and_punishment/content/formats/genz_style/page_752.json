  "text": "Raskolnikov's mom, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, got super down after Dounia married Razumihin. To cheer her up, Razumihin shared how Raskolnikov had helped a poor student and saved two kids from a fire last year. This news sent Pulcheria into a frenzy of excitement. She couldn't stop talking about it, even chatting with random people on the street, while Dounia tried to keep her calm. \n\nBut Dounia was worried. Pulcheria's excitement was risky—what if someone mentioned Raskolnikov’s recent trial? Pulcheria even tracked down the mom of the kids Raskolnikov saved and insisted on visiting her.\n\nThings got really intense. Pulcheria would burst into tears out of nowhere and often felt sick and delirious. One morning, she convinced herself Rodya (Raskolnikov) would be home soon. She remembered he said to expect him back in nine months. So, she started getting ready for his return—cleaning the room, washing furniture, putting up new curtains, and all that. Dounia felt anxious but stayed quiet, helping her mom with the preparations. After a long day of work, they were both exhausted.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pulcheria Alexandrovna becomes increasingly anxious and ill as she prepares for her son Raskolnikov's return, reflecting her disordered imagination and emotional turmoil."
