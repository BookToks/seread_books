You seem to think it’s wrong for me to talk about women this way.’\n\n‘You really want to know if I think there’s something wrong with vice?’ \n\n‘Vice! Is that what you think I’m after? Fine, let’s break it down. First off, I love to chat, so why should I hold back? Why give up on women when I’m passionate about them? It’s something to do, after all.’\n\n‘So, you’re saying all you want is vice?’\n\n‘Alright, sure, let’s call it vice. You’re the one making a big deal out of it. But I appreciate a straight question. There’s something real about this vice—something natural, not just in my head. It’s like an ember in my blood, always ready to ignite and tough to put out, even as the years go by. You have to admit, it’s a kind of hobby.’\n\n‘That’s not something to celebrate; it’s a sickness and a risky one.’\n\n‘Oh, that’s your take? I get it. It is a sickness, like anything that goes too far. And yeah, this definitely goes too far. But honestly, everyone has their own way of going overboard. Plus, sure, we should try to be moderate and sensible, even if it sounds lame. But what’s my alternative? Without this, I might as well end it all. I know a good person should deal with boredom, but still…’\n\n‘You really think you could end it all?’ \n\n‘Come on!’ Svidrigaïlov shot back, clearly annoyed. ‘Let’s not go there.’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov discusses his views on vice and women, arguing that his passion for them is a natural and enduring aspect of life."
