  "text": "Nikolay had been read like an open book by Porfiry from the start. The way they spoke and acted made it clear—Nikolay couldn't shake that feeling. \n\n“Wow, even Razumihin is starting to catch on! That chat in the hallway really made an impact,” Raskolnikov thought. He rushed to Porfiry, but why did Porfiry brush him off with Nikolay? What was his game plan? Something was definitely up, and it had been way too long since he last saw Porfiry. That was a bad sign…\n\nRaskolnikov grabbed his cap and headed out, finally feeling a bit clearer in his head. “I need to deal with Svidrigaïlov, and fast. He seems to be waiting for me to make a move.” At that moment, a surge of anger bubbled up in him—he felt like he could take out either Porfiry or Svidrigaïlov. He knew he’d be capable of it later, if not now.\n\n“We’ll see, we’ll see,” he muttered to himself.\n\nBut as soon as he opened the door, he nearly ran into Porfiry in the hallway. He was coming in to see him. Raskolnikov was caught off guard for a second, but it was just a second. Oddly, he wasn’t too shocked or scared—just surprised. He quickly shifted into defensive mode.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels a renewed clarity and determination as he contemplates settling his conflicts with Svidrigaïlov and Porfiry."
