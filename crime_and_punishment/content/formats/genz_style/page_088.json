That poor horse pulling such a heavy load?” another chimed in.  \n“You’re gonna kill her!” shouted a third voice.  \n\n“Stay out of it! She’s my property, and I’ll do what I want. Come on, everyone! Get in! Let’s make her run fast!”  \n\nSuddenly, laughter erupted, drowning everything out. The mare, now getting hit, started weakly kicking. Even the old man couldn’t help but crack a smile. Just imagine that little horse trying to fight back!  \n\nTwo guys from the crowd grabbed whips and ran to the horse, hitting her on the sides. One on each side.  \n“Hit her in the face! Right in the eyes!” Mikolka yelled.  \n“Let’s hear a song, guys!” someone in the cart shouted, and everyone joined in a wild tune, shaking a tambourine and whistling. The woman kept cracking nuts and laughing.  \n\nHe ran alongside the mare, then in front of her, watching as she got whipped across the eyes—right in the eyes! Tears streamed down his face. One guy even whipped him across the face, but he didn’t feel it. Desperate, he wrung his hands and screamed, rushing over to the old man with the gray beard, who was shaking his head in disapproval. A woman tried to pull him away, but he broke free.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A crowd cruelly mocks and abuses a struggling mare, while one onlooker is overwhelmed with sorrow and desperation."
