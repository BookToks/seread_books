Dmitri Prokofitch Razumihin,” she said, introducing him to Luzhin. \n\n“I had the pleasure… yesterday,” Pyotr Petrovitch muttered, shooting a hostile glance at Razumihin. Then he scowled and went silent.\n\nPyotr Petrovitch was one of those people who act super polite in social settings. They care a lot about manners, but the second something doesn’t go their way, they turn into awkward messes—like sacks of flour instead of charming folks. \n\nSilence fell again. Raskolnikov stayed quiet, Avdotya Romanovna (Dounia) didn’t want to jump into the conversation too soon, and Razumihin had nothing to add. Pulcheria Alexandrovna was getting anxious again.\n\n“Have you heard? Marfa Petrovna is dead,” she said, bringing up her go-to topic.\n\n“Yes, I heard. I was told right away. I also found out that Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov rushed to Petersburg right after his wife’s funeral. I have good sources on that,” he replied.\n\n“To Petersburg?
