They were getting close to Bakaleyev’s place, where Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Dounia had been waiting forever. Razumihin kept pausing, caught up in the heat of their discussion, clearly flustered by finally talking about this openly.\n\n“Fine, don’t believe it!” Raskolnikov shot back, smirking a bit. “You didn’t notice anything, but I was analyzing every word.”\n\n“You’re just being paranoid. That’s why you’re overthinking their words… sure, Porfiry’s tone was off, and that loser Zametov? Yeah, something was up with him—but why?” \n\n“He’s changed his mind since last night.”\n\n“Actually, it’s the opposite! If they were onto something dumb, they’d be trying to hide it, keeping their cards close to their chest to catch you off guard later. But they were just bold and careless.”\n\n“If they had real evidence—or even a hint of suspicion—they’d definitely try to cover their tracks. They’d have searched ages ago otherwise. But they’ve got nothing.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin and Raskolnikov engage in a tense discussion about the implications of their recent encounters, reflecting on the strange behavior of Porfiry and Zametov."
