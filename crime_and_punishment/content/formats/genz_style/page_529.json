  "text": "“I don’t want to be a fool in your free marriage or raise another guy’s kids, that’s why I want a legal marriage,” Luzhin said, trying to sound smart. He seemed lost in thought.\n\n“Kids? You mentioned kids,” Lebeziatnikov jumped in like he was ready to race. “Kids are a big deal, I get it. But some people choose not to have kids at all because they think it ties into the whole family thing. We can talk about kids later, but let’s focus on honor for now. That’s where I struggle. That awful military phrase from Pushkin? Totally outdated. What does it even mean? It’s nonsense. There’s no deception in a free marriage! It’s just the natural result of a legal marriage, like a reaction. So, it’s not humiliating. \n\nIf I ever got legally married—just imagine that absurdity—I’d be happy about it. I’d tell my wife, ‘Hey, I’ve loved you until now, but now I respect you because you’ve shown you can stand up for yourself!’ You’re laughing? That’s because you can’t shake off old-school views. Honestly, I get why being deceived in a legal marriage feels bad, but that’s just a nasty result of a nasty situation where both people are embarrassed. When the truth is out there, like in a free marriage, it doesn’t even exist. Your wife will only show how much she respects you!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Luzhin argues that legal marriage is necessary to avoid humiliation and deception, while Lebeziatnikov contends that free marriage eliminates such issues by allowing open relationships."
