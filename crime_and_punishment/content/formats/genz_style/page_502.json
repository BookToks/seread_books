  "text": "What was that “surprise”? Was it a joke? Did it even mean anything? Could it hide some kind of truth or solid proof? What happened to yesterday’s visitor? Where was he now? If Porfiry had any evidence, it had to be linked to him…\n\nRaskolnikov sat on the sofa, elbows on his knees, face buried in his hands. He was still shaking with nerves. Finally, he got up, grabbed his cap, thought for a second, and headed for the door.\n\nHe felt a weird sense of relief, like maybe he was safe for now. A flicker of joy hit him; he wanted to rush over to Katerina Ivanovna’s place. Sure, he’d miss the funeral, but he’d make it for the memorial dinner—and he’d see Sonia there.\n\nHe paused, thought for a moment, and a pained smile crossed his face. “Today! Today,” he kept telling himself. “Yes, today! It has to be….”\n\nJust as he was about to open the door, it creaked open on its own. He jumped back. The door swung slowly, and there stood yesterday’s visitor from underground.\n\nThe man stepped into the room, staring at Raskolnikov without saying a word. He looked just like before—same clothes, same figure—but his face was different. He looked downcast and let out a heavy sigh.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a fleeting sense of relief and anticipation before being confronted by a mysterious visitor from the previous day."
