  "text": "The cry of the sick, struggling woman hit everyone hard. Her worn-out face, cracked lips, and shaky voice, along with her childlike tears and desperate plea for help, were so heartbreaking that it tugged at everyone’s heartstrings. Even Pyotr Petrovitch felt a wave of sympathy.\n\n“Madam, madam, this situation doesn’t reflect on you!” he exclaimed dramatically. “No one would dare accuse you of being behind this, especially since you’ve shown her guilt by emptying her pockets. You had no clue before, right? I’m totally ready to show compassion if poverty drove Sofya Semyonovna to this. But why didn’t you confess, mademoiselle? Were you scared of the shame? Maybe you just panicked? I get it…but how could you stoop to this?”\n\nHe turned to everyone else, saying, “Gentlemen! Out of pity for these folks, I’m willing to overlook this, even after the personal insult aimed at me! Let this shame be a lesson for you moving forward,” he added, looking directly at Sonia. “I won’t take this any further. That’s enough!”\n\nPyotr Petrovitch glanced at Raskolnikov. Their eyes locked, and Raskolnikov’s gaze was like fire, ready to burn him to ashes. Meanwhile, Katerina Ivanovna seemed oblivious to it all. She was hugging Sonia tightly, almost like she was losing it. The kids were also clinging to Sonia, showering her with affection.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The scene depicts a moment of intense emotional turmoil as a sick woman pleads for help, eliciting compassion from the audience while highlighting the moral complexities surrounding poverty and guilt."
