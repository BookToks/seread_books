Porfiry Petrovitch, the head of the Investigation Department here… you know him, right?’  \n‘Is he related to you?’  \n‘Distantly. But why the frown? Just because you had a fight once, doesn’t mean you can’t come.’  \n‘I really don’t care about him.’  \n‘That’s fine. Anyway, there’ll be some students, a teacher, a government clerk, a musician, an officer, and Zametov.’  \n‘Seriously, what do you or he’—Zossimov pointed at Raskolnikov—‘have in common with Zametov?’  \n‘Oh, you’re so picky! Principles! You’re all about principles, like they’re gears in a machine; you won’t even think for yourself. If a guy’s cool, that’s my only principle. Zametov’s a great guy.’  \n‘Even if he takes bribes?’  \n‘Yeah, he does! So what? I’m not saying it’s right, but he’s a nice guy in his own way! Honestly, if you look at people, how many good ones are left? I’d say I’m not worth much myself… maybe with you included.’  \n‘That’s too low; I’d give you two for yourself.’  \n‘And I’d only give one for you. No more.’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin defends Zametov's character despite his flaws, emphasizing the importance of personal connections over rigid principles."
