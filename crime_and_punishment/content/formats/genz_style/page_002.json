  "text": "**Crime and Punishment - Translator’s Preface**\n\nLet’s talk a bit about Dostoevsky to help you get his vibe. \n\nHe was born to a doctor and grew up in a super religious and hardworking family. They were so broke that he and his four siblings squeezed into just two rooms. His parents spent their evenings reading serious books to their kids. 📚\n\nDostoevsky was always sickly, but he still managed to snag third place in his final exams at the Petersburg school of Engineering. That’s where he kicked off his writing journey with ‘Poor Folk.’ \n\nThis story got published by the poet Nekrassov in his magazine and people loved it! Suddenly, this shy guy was a bit of a star. It seemed like he was on the path to a bright future, but then everything changed. In 1849, he got arrested.\n\nEven though he wasn’t a revolutionary by nature, he hung out with a small group of guys who liked to read thinkers like Fourier and Proudhon. He ended up being accused of chatting against the censorship, reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and knowing about plans for a printing press. All of this happened under Nicholas I. 🕵️‍♂️\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dostoevsky, despite his promising beginnings and literary acclaim, faced arrest and condemnation due to his involvement in discussions against censorship."
