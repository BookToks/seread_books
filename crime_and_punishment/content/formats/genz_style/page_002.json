  "text": "Crime and Punishment - Translator’s Preface\n\nLet’s talk a bit about Dostoevsky. It’ll help you vibe with his work better. \n\nDostoevsky was born to a doctor. His parents were super hard-working and really religious, but they were also super broke, living in just two rooms with their five kids. They spent their evenings reading serious stuff to their children. 📚\n\nDostoevsky was always sickly, but he still managed to snag third place in his final exams at the Petersburg school of Engineering. While there, he kicked off his writing journey with ‘Poor Folk.’ \n\nThis story got published by the poet Nekrassov in his review and people loved it! Suddenly, this shy, unknown guy was kind of a big deal. A bright future seemed to be on the horizon for him, but that didn’t last long. In 1849, he got arrested.\n\nEven though he wasn’t really a revolutionary by nature or belief, Dostoevsky was part of a small group of young guys who met to read thinkers like Fourier and Proudhon. He got accused of “chatting against censorship,” reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and knowing about plans to start a printing press. 😬 Under Nicholas I, things got intense.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dostoevsky, despite his promising beginnings as a writer, faced arrest in 1849 for his involvement in discussions against censorship."
