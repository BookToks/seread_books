The heat was brutal, mixed with a nasty smell of fresh paint and old oil from the newly decorated rooms.\n\nAfter a bit of waiting, he decided to push into the next room. All the rooms were tiny and cramped. He felt a strong urge to keep moving. No one noticed him. In the second room, some clerks were writing, looking just as rough as he did, and they had a strange vibe. He approached one of them.\n\n“What’s up?” \n\nHe showed the clerk the notice he had. \n\n“You a student?” the guy asked, glancing at the paper.\n\n“Yeah, used to be.”\n\nThe clerk looked him over but didn’t seem to care at all. He was disheveled, with a vacant stare. \n\n“Not gonna get anything from him; he’s checked out,” Raskolnikov thought. \n\n“Head clerk’s in there,” the clerk said, pointing to the farthest room. \n\nHe walked into that room—the fourth one. It was small and packed with people, dressed a bit nicer than in the other rooms. Among them were two ladies. One, dressed in mourning, sat at the table across from him.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov navigates a crowded, stifling office filled with indifferent clerks and a sense of impatience."
