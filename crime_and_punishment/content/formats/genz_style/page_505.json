  "text": "I couldn’t sleep, so I started asking questions. I figured out where to go and went there today. The first time, the guy wasn’t there. The second time, he couldn’t see me. Finally, on my third try, they let me in. I told him everything that happened, and he started pacing around, hitting himself on the chest. “What do you scoundrels mean by this? If I’d known, I would’ve arrested him!” Then he dashed out, called someone over, and started chatting in the corner. After that, he turned back to me, scolding and questioning me like crazy. \n\nI told him everything, including how you didn’t respond to me yesterday and didn’t even recognize me. He went back to pacing, getting angrier, and when you were announced, he told me to go into the next room. “Sit tight,” he said. “Don’t move, no matter what you hear.” He set up a chair for me and locked the door. “I might call you later,” he added. When Nikolay came in, he let me out as soon as you left. “I’ll send for you again to ask more questions,” he said.\n\n“Did he question Nikolay while I was there?” I asked. \n\n“He sent me away before he talked to Nikolay, just like he did with you.” \n\nThe man paused, then suddenly bowed down, touching the ground with his finger. “Forgive me for my bad thoughts and slander.” \n\n“May God forgive you,” Raskolnikov replied. As he said this, the man bowed again, but not in a casual way.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov recounts a tense encounter with a man who was agitated about a previous incident, revealing the complexities of guilt and suspicion."
