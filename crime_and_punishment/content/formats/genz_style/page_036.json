He-he-he!” Marmeladov wanted to pour himself a drink, but the bottle was empty. \n\n“What’s there to pity you for?” the tavern-keeper shouted, joining the crowd. \n\nLaughter and curses erupted from the listeners and even from those who had no clue what was happening but were just watching the ex-government clerk. \n\n“Pity me? Why should I be pitied?” Marmeladov suddenly stood up, arm outstretched, as if he’d been waiting for that moment. \n\n“Pity me, you say? There’s nothing to pity! I should be crucified, not pitied! Go ahead, judge, crucify me! I’ll do it myself if I have to. I’m not looking for a party; I want tears and suffering! Do you think this drink has been sweet for me? No! I wanted to feel something deep, and I found it—pain and sorrow. But there’s someone who will have pity on us, the one who understands everyone and everything. He’s the true judge. \n\nOn that day, He’ll ask: ‘Where’s the daughter who sacrificed herself for her sick stepmother and the kids of another? Where’s the daughter who cared for her filthy drunkard father, despite how low he’d sunk?’ And He’ll say, ‘Come to me! I’ve already forgiven you once… I’ve forgiven you… Your many sins are forgiven.’”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marmeladov expresses a deep sense of suffering and the desire for understanding and forgiveness amidst his tribulations."
