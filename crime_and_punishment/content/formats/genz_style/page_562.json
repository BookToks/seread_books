  "text": "Raskolnikov was wiped out after his big speech. He looked rough, but his words hit hard. Everyone was buying what he was selling. Pyotr Petrovitch, on the other hand, was sweating it out. \n\n“What’s it to me if you had some dumb ideas?” he yelled, “That’s not proof! You probably just dreamed it! You’re lying and just trying to trash me because I don’t buy into your godless, free-thinking nonsense!” \n\nBut that comeback didn’t help him. People were murmuring their disapproval. \n\n“Is that your angle now?” Lebeziatnikov shouted back. “That’s ridiculous! Call the cops, and I’ll swear to it! I can’t wrap my head around why he’d pull such a pathetic stunt. What a loser!” \n\nRaskolnikov stepped up, his voice steady. “I can explain why he did it, and I’ll swear to it too if I have to.” \n\nHe looked calm and confident. Everyone could tell he was onto something, and they were ready for answers. \n\n“Now I get it,” Raskolnikov said to Lebeziatnikov. “From the start, I had a feeling there was some shady scheme behind this. I picked up on it due to some details only I know.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confidently asserts his understanding of a deceitful plot, indicating a turning point in the unfolding drama."
