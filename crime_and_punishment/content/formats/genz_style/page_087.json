  "text": "Six guys hopped into the cart, and there was still space. They pulled in a plump, cheerful woman dressed in red cotton, wearing a beaded headdress and thick leather shoes. She was cracking nuts and laughing, and the crowd couldn’t help but join in. How could they not? That poor mare was supposed to haul all of them at a gallop! \n\nTwo young guys in the cart were getting their whips ready to help Mikolka. With a shout of “now,” the mare pulled with all her strength, but instead of galloping, she could barely move. She struggled, gasping for breath as the three whips fell on her like hail. The laughter from the cart and the crowd grew even louder, but Mikolka was furious. He thrashed the mare, as if he thought she could actually gallop.\n\n“Let me in too, guys!” shouted a young man from the crowd, excited by the scene. \n\n“Get in, everyone! She can pull you all!” Mikolka yelled. “I’ll beat her to death!” And he kept whipping the mare, consumed by rage.\n\n“Father, father!” cried a boy in shock. “What are they doing? They’re beating the poor horse!” \n\n“Come on, let’s go!” his dad urged. “They’re just drunk and acting foolish; it’s all a joke. Don’t look!” He tried to pull his son away, but the boy broke free and ran to the horse, horrified. The poor creature was in bad shape, gasping and struggling to stay on her feet. \n\n“Beat her to death!” Mikolka shouted. “It’s come to that.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A drunken crowd cruelly forces a struggling mare to pull a heavy cart while laughing at her plight."
