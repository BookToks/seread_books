  "text": "At the top of the stairs, it was dark, even though there’s no real night here. \n\nA grimy little door was slightly open. Inside, a tiny, messy room stretched out about ten paces long, lit only by a candle stub. You could see everything from the entrance. The place was a wreck, filled with all kinds of rags, especially kids' clothes. In the far corner, a tattered sheet hung—probably hiding a bed. The room had just two chairs and a sofa covered in worn-out leather, with holes everywhere. An old, bare kitchen table stood in front of it, and on the edge of the table, a smoldering tallow candle sat in an iron candlestick. \n\nIt looked like this family had their own space, not just a corner of a bigger room, but it felt more like a hallway. The door to the other rooms, or really cupboards, in Amalia Lippevechsel’s flat was half-open. Inside, you could hear shouting, laughter, and the sounds of people playing cards and drinking tea. A bunch of loud, crude words flew out now and then.\n\nRaskolnikov spotted Katerina Ivanovna right away. She was tall and slim but looked really sick, with dark brown hair and a flushed face. She paced around the cramped room, pressing her hands to her chest, breathing in shaky gasps. Her eyes sparkled with fever and had a harsh, unyielding stare. The flickering candlelight danced across her pale, excited face.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov observes Katerina Ivanovna in her disordered, impoverished room, revealing her distress and deteriorating health."
