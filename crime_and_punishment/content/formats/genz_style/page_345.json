Oh, right, Sofya Ivanovna…”  \n“Sofya Semyonovna,” Raskolnikov corrected. “Sofya Semyonovna, this is my buddy Razumihin. He’s a solid dude.”  \n“If you need to bounce now…” Sonia started, avoiding eye contact with Razumihin and looking more awkward.  \n“Let’s go,” Raskolnikov decided. “I’ll swing by later, Sofya Semyonovna. Just tell me where you’re at.”  \nHe didn’t seem nervous, but he was in a rush and avoided her gaze. Sonia gave her address, blushing as she did. They all headed out together.  \n“Don’t you lock up?” Razumihin asked, following Raskolnikov down the stairs.  \n“Never,” Raskolnikov replied. “Been meaning to get a lock for two years now. People who don’t need locks are lucky,” he joked, looking at Sonia. They paused in the doorway.  \n“Do you go right, Sofya Semyonovna? How did you even find me?” he asked, trying to say something else. He wanted to look into her soft, clear eyes, but it was tough.  \n“You gave your address to Polenka yesterday.”  \n“Polenka? Oh, right; she’s the little girl. Is she your sister? Did I really give her my address?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov and Sonia discuss their acquaintance and plans to meet, revealing a growing connection between them."
