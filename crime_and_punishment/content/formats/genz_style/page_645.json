A little fresh air wouldn’t hurt,” he said, also putting on his cap.\n\n“Porfiry Petrovitch, don’t think I confessed anything today,” Raskolnikov insisted, looking grumpy. “You’re a weird guy, and I was just curious. I haven’t admitted anything, got it?”\n\n“Oh, I know. I’ll remember. Look at you, shaking! Don’t stress, my dude. Walk around a bit, but don’t wander too far. If something happens, I need to ask you something,” he said, lowering his voice. “It’s kind of awkward, but important. If you ever think about ending things—(I don’t really believe you would, but just in case)—please leave a short note. Just two lines, and mention the stone. It’ll be more thoughtful. Alright, see you later! Think good thoughts!” \n\nPorfiry left, bending down and avoiding eye contact with Raskolnikov. Raskolnikov moved to the window and waited.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov insists he has not confessed to Porfiry, despite the latter's probing and concern for his well-being."
