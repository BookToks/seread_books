I’m not caught up in any nonsense.”  \n\nThey walked in silence until they got near Raskolnikov’s place. Razumihin finally spoke up, clearly worried.  \n“Listen, you’re a great guy, but you’re also a mess. You’re a bit of a loose cannon, and honestly, kind of dirty. You’re weak, anxious, and full of quirks. You’re getting lazy and can’t even hold back on anything—and that’s just gross because it leads you down a bad path. You’ve gotten so laid-back that I can’t believe you’re still a good doctor. You—a doctor—sleep on a comfy bed and wake up at night for your patients? In a few years, you won’t even bother getting up for them…”  \n\n“But that’s not the point! You’re crashing at the landlady’s flat tonight. (Trust me, it took a lot to convince her!) I’ll be in the kitchen. So, here’s your chance to get to know her better… It’s not what you think!

She’s super charming… I’ll owe you big time!”  \n\nZossimov laughed harder than before.  \n“Wow, you’re really into her! But what do you want me to do about it?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin expresses concern about Raskolnikov's deteriorating state and encourages him to connect with a woman who may help him."
