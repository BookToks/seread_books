  "text": "I had a situation. I got it, then lost it again. You get me? This time, it was totally my fault. My weakness showed. Now, weâ€™re stuck in a room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechselâ€™s place. I canâ€™t even explain how we pay rent or what we live on. There are tons of people crammed in there with us. Itâ€™s chaotic and dirtyâ€”a total mess. \n\nMeanwhile, my daughter from my first marriage has grown up. I wonâ€™t even get into what sheâ€™s had to deal with from her step-mom. Katerina Ivanovna has a big heart, but sheâ€™s also fiery and quick to anger. \n\nAnyway, Soniaâ€”my daughterâ€”has had zero education. I tried to teach her some geography and history four years ago, but I wasnâ€™t really up to speed myself, and we didnâ€™t have the right books. Now we donâ€™t even have those anymore. We stopped at Cyrus of Persia. Since then, sheâ€™s picked up some romantic novels and recently read a book called Lewesâ€™ Physiology from Mr. Lebeziatnikov. Ever heard of it? She even shared some bits from it with us. Thatâ€™s basically her whole education.\n\nNow, can I ask you something, sir? Do you think a decent, poor girl can earn much with honest work? Not a chance. Sheâ€™d be lucky to make fifteen farthings a day, and thatâ€™s if sheâ€™s respectable and has no special skills. And she canâ€™t even take a break while working! ðŸ˜“\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The narrator reflects on the struggles of his family, particularly the hardships faced by his daughter Sonia due to poverty and lack of education."
