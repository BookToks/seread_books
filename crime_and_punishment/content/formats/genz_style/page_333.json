  "text": "‘Pyotr Petrovitch isn’t shy about his basic education. He’s actually proud of how he got where he is,’ Avdotya Romanovna said, a bit hurt by her brother’s tone.\n\n‘Sure, he has a reason to be proud. I get that. But you seem annoyed, sister, that I’m making what you call a “frivolous” comment about the letter. I’m not trying to bug you. My point about the style is relevant to what’s going on. There’s this one line, “blame yourselves,” that’s pretty blunt, and he also threatens to leave if I’m around. That threat basically means he’ll ditch you both if you don’t obey him, especially after he called you to Petersburg. What do you think? Should we be angry about something like that if it came from Luzhin, or Razumihin, or one of us?’ \n\n‘N-no,’ Dounia replied, sounding more engaged. ‘I noticed it was too simple and that maybe he just can’t write well… that’s a fair point, brother. I didn’t expect…’\n\n‘It’s written in a legal way, which makes it sound harsher than he probably meant. But I have to clear something up. There’s a nasty comment in there about me. I gave money last night to a widow who’s really struggling with her illness, not “under the pretext of the funeral,” but just to help pay for it. And it wasn’t to her daughter—a young woman.’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Avdotya Romanovna and her brother discuss a letter from Luzhin, critiquing its tone and implications regarding family loyalty and financial support."
