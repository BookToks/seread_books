  "text": "We’ve gone over this before. I was really glad to share my thoughts with you. But wow, you look super pale, Avdotya Romanovna. \n\n“I know his theory. I read that article he wrote about how some people think they can do anything. Razumihin brought it to me.”\n\n“Mr. Razumihin? Your brother’s article? In a magazine? I didn’t even know that existed. Sounds interesting. But where are you headed, Avdotya Romanovna?”\n\n“I need to see Sofya Semyonovna,” Dounia said quietly. “How do I get to her? She might be back already. I really need to see her.”\n\nDounia couldn’t finish her thought; she was struggling to breathe.\n\n“Sofya Semyonovna won’t be back until tonight, at least that’s what I think. She was supposed to return quickly, but if she’s not here yet, it’ll be a while.”\n\n“Ah, so you’re lying! I see it now… you’ve been lying this whole time! I don’t believe you! I don’t believe you!” Dounia shouted, completely losing it.\n\nShe almost fainted and collapsed into a chair that Svidrigaïlov quickly offered her.\n\n“Avdotya Romanovna, what’s wrong? Calm down! Here’s some water. Drink a bit…”\n\nHe splashed some water on her. Dounia shuddered but then started to regain her composure.\n\n“That had a strong effect,” Svidrigaïlov muttered to himself, looking worried. “Avdotya Romanovna, please calm down! Trust me, he has friends. We can help him. Want me to take him abroad? I have money; I can get a ticket in three days.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Avdotya Romanovna is distressed and desperate to see Sofya Semyonovna, believing she may have important news."
