But the cross-examination is tomorrow?” he said, feeling bitter. “Do I really have to explain myself to them? I’m already annoyed I even talked to Zametov at the restaurant yesterday…”\n\n“Forget it! I’ll go to Porfiry myself. I’ll get the scoop from him—like family. He has to fill me in on everything! And about Zametov…”\n\n“Finally, he’s catching on!” thought Raskolnikov.\n\n“Wait!” Razumihin grabbed his shoulder again. “Hold up! You're wrong. How was that a trap? You think the question about the workmen was a setup. But if you had done that, could you really say you saw them painting the flat? You wouldn’t have seen anything, even if you did. Who would admit that?”\n\n“If I had done it, I would’ve definitely claimed I saw the workmen and the flat,” Raskolnikov replied, reluctant and clearly disgusted.\n\n“Why would you talk against yourself?”\n\n“Because only clueless rookies deny everything during interrogations. If someone has even a bit of experience, they’ll admit the obvious facts but twist them to fit their story. They’ll find a way to make them mean something different. Porfiry might expect that.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov grapples with the psychological intricacies of his situation and the impending cross-examination regarding the murder."
