  "text": "\"Let’s go, man,\" Marmeladov suddenly said, looking at Raskolnikov. \"I’m heading to Katerina Ivanovna’s place—it's about time.\" \n\nRaskolnikov had been wanting to help him for a while. Marmeladov was swaying more than talking and leaned heavily on him. They had a few hundred steps to go, and the drunk guy was getting more anxious as they got closer to the house.\n\n\"It’s not Katerina Ivanovna I’m scared of,\" he muttered, clearly nervous. \"I’m not worried about her pulling my hair. Who cares about that? Honestly, if she starts yanking it, that’s fine. What really freaks me out are her eyes… and the redness on her cheeks. Even her breathing… Have you seen how people breathe when they're sick and worked up? It’s terrifying. And the kids crying too… What if Sonia hasn’t fed them? I have no idea what’s going on! But I’m not scared of getting hit. Trust me, those hits don’t hurt me; they actually feel good. I need it, honestly. It’s better this way. Let her hit me; it helps her let it out. There’s the house. The cabinet-maker Kozel lives here—a German, doing pretty well. You lead the way!\"\n\nThey entered from the yard and climbed up to the fourth floor. The staircase got darker with every step. It was almost eleven o'clock, and even though it was summer in Petersburg…\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marmeladov, in a state of dismay and confusion, expresses his fear of facing his wife Katerina Ivanovna and the potential consequences of their dire situation."
