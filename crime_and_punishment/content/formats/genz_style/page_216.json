  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nWe’ve totally cut ties with the past, and honestly, that’s a big deal. \n\n“He’s just showing off!” Raskolnikov blurted out. \n\n“What?” Pyotr Petrovitch asked, confused, but got no answer. \n\n“That’s true,” Zossimov quickly jumped in. \n\n“Right?” Pyotr Petrovitch continued, turning to Zossimov with a smirk. “You’ve got to admit, there’s been some progress in science and economic truth…” \n\n“Just the usual stuff.” \n\n“No, it’s not just the usual!” Pyotr Petrovitch insisted, maybe a bit too eager. “Think about it—if I heard ‘love thy neighbor,’ what did that get me? I ended up tearing my coat in half to share, and we were both left half-naked. Like the Russian saying goes, ‘Catch several hares and you won’t catch one.’ Now, science says to love yourself first. Everything’s about self-interest. You take care of yourself, and your coat stays whole. \n\nEconomic truth says that when everyone organizes their personal stuff better—more whole coats, you know—the whole society gets stronger and everyone benefits. So, when I focus on getting rich just for me, I’m actually helping everyone out too. 💰\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The conversation discusses the shift from altruism to self-interest as a means to achieve societal progress and welfare."
