  "text": "And about the murder? He’ll do a bunch of good stuff to make up for it. Chill out. He might still become someone great. So, how are you feeling? \n\n“Cruel! How can you joke about this? Let me go…”\n\n“Where are you headed?”\n\n“To him. Where is he? Do you know? Why is this door locked? We came in through here, and now it’s locked. When did you do that?”\n\n“We can’t just shout about this everywhere. I’m not making fun; I’m just tired of talking like this. But how can you go in there like this? You’ll betray him! You’ll make him furious, and then he’ll turn himself in. Trust me, they’re already watching him. You’ll just give him away. Chill for a second: I just saw him and talked to him. He can still be saved. Just wait a bit; sit down, let’s think this through together. I wanted to talk to you alone about it. Please, sit down!”\n\n“How can you save him? Is it really possible?”\n\nDounia sat down. Svidrigaïlov sat next to her. \n\n“It all depends on you, on you alone,” he said, his eyes lighting up, almost whispering because he was so emotional.\n\nDounia pulled back, startled. He was shaking too.\n\n“You… just one word from you, and he’s saved. I… I’ll save him. I have money and connections. I’ll get him out of here right away. I’ll get a passport—two passports, one for him and one for me. I know people… capable people…”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia is urged to consider her influence over her brother's fate, as Svidrigaïlov believes she can help save him from his dire situation."
