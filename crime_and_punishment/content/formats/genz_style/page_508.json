  "text": "**Crime and Punishment**  \n**Chapter I**  \n\nThe morning after that awkward talk with Dounia and her mom hit Pyotr Petrovitch hard. It was rough, but he had to face the truth he’d been dodging. The sting of his bruised ego gnawed at him all night. When he finally rolled out of bed, he rushed to the mirror. He half-expected to see signs of jaundice (a liver issue that turns your skin yellow). Luckily, he looked fine, with his noble, clear skin—though he had gained a bit of weight lately. For a moment, he felt reassured, thinking he could find another bride, maybe even a better one. \n\nBut then reality hit him again. He turned away and spat, which made his young friend, Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, smirk. Pyotr Petrovitch caught that grin and mentally added it to his list of grievances against Andrey. He’d been keeping track of all the things that annoyed him about his friend. His frustration grew when he realized he shouldn’t have shared the outcome of yesterday’s meeting with Andrey. That was his second blunder, fueled by impatience and irritation.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pyotr Petrovitch grapples with his wounded vanity and irritation following an unpleasant interview, reflecting on his personal shortcomings and relationships."
