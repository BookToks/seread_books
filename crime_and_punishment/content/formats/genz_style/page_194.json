Zossimov studied him closely. \n\n“Looks good… he’s doing alright,” he said, sounding relaxed. “Has he eaten anything?” \n\nThey filled him in and asked what he should have. \n\n“He can have anything… soup, tea… but no mushrooms or cucumbers, and probably skip the meat too. But you already know that!” Razumihin and Zossimov exchanged looks. “No more medicine or anything. I’ll check on him again tomorrow. Maybe even today… but whatever.” \n\n“Tomorrow evening, I’ll take him for a walk,” Razumihin said. “We’re hitting up the Yusupov garden and then the Palais de Crystal.” \n\n“I wouldn’t bother him tomorrow, but maybe just a little… we’ll see.” \n\n“Ugh, what a pain! I have a housewarming party tonight, just a hop away. Can he come? He can chill on the sofa. You’re coming too, right?” Razumihin asked Zossimov. “Don’t bail on me; you promised.” \n\n“Fine, but I’ll show up later. What’s the plan?” \n\n“Oh, just tea, vodka, herring. There’s gonna be pie… just our crew.” \n\n“And who’s that?” \n\n“Mostly neighbors, all new friends. Except my uncle—he’s new too, just got to Petersburg yesterday for some business. We only see each other every five years.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Zossimov monitors a patient's condition while discussing plans for a house-warming party with Razumihin."
