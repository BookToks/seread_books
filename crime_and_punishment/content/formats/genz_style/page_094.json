  "text": "Lizaveta knew a bit about Raskolnikov, and he knew a lot about her. She was around thirty-five, tall, awkward, and timid—basically, she was stuck in her sister's shadow. Her sister was a total tyrant, making her work non-stop and even hitting her. \n\nRight now, Lizaveta stood there with a bundle, listening to the huckster and his wife chat about something that seemed important. When Raskolnikov spotted her, he felt a weird mix of shock and confusion, even though their meeting wasn't that surprising.\n\n“You could think for yourself, Lizaveta Ivanovna,” the huckster said loudly. “Come by tomorrow at seven. They’ll be here too.”\n\n“Tomorrow?” Lizaveta replied slowly, clearly unsure.\n\n“Honestly, you’re so scared of Alyona Ivanovna,” chimed in the huckster’s wife, a lively little woman. “You look like a scared child! And she’s not even your real sister—just a stepsister! What a grip she has on you!”\n\n“Just don’t mention it to Alyona Ivanovna,” the huckster cut in. “That’s my advice. Just come over without asking. It’ll be worth it. Your sister might even get involved later.”\n\n“Am I supposed to come?” Lizaveta asked.\n\n“Yep, at seven tomorrow. You can decide then.”\n\n“And we’ll have some tea,” his wife added cheerfully. ☕️\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Lizaveta, a timid and submissive woman, is encouraged by a huckster and his wife to visit them the next day, hinting at her troubled relationship with her domineering sister, Alyona."
