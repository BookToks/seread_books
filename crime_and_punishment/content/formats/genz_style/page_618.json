If you start spilling your secrets, I’ll probably just storm off cursing. I just want to know if it’s true that you’re mad. Everyone thinks you are, or at least close to it. I’ve been leaning that way too, especially after seeing your dumb, weird actions and how you’ve treated your mom and sister. Only a monster or a madman would act like that. So yeah, you must be mad.”\n\n“When was the last time you saw them?” \n\n“Just now. Haven’t you seen them since? What have you been up to? Seriously, I’ve come to see you three times already. Your mom’s been really sick since yesterday. She wanted to come see you, but Avdotya Romanovna tried to stop her. She wouldn’t listen. ‘If he’s sick or losing it, who else can take care of him but his mom?’ she said. We all came here with her; we couldn’t let her come alone. We kept telling her to stay calm. We walked in, but you weren’t here. She sat down for ten minutes while we waited in silence. Then she got up and said, ‘If he’s out, or if he’s fine and has forgotten his mom, it’s just embarrassing for me to stand here begging for his attention.’ She went home and went to bed; now she’s got a fever.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The speaker confronts someone about their madness and neglect of their ill mother and sister, expressing concern over their behavior."
