  "text": "By the way, Potchinkov’s house is just a quick walk away. I definitely need to see Razumihin, even if it’s super close. Let him enjoy his win! He deserves it too—whatever. What I really need is strength. You can’t get anything without it, and strength has to be earned—that’s what they don’t get, he thought, feeling proud and confident as he walked slowly from the bridge. His pride and confidence kept building; he was turning into a new person with every step. What caused this change? He had no clue. But like someone grabbing onto a lifeline, he suddenly felt he could actually live again, that his life wasn’t over just because the old woman was gone. Maybe he was jumping to conclusions, but he didn’t care.\n\nOh, but I did ask her to keep ‘Thy servant Rodion’ in her prayers, he remembered. “Well, that was just in case,” he chuckled at his own childish thought. He was feeling great.\n\nFinding Razumihin was easy; the new guy was already known at Potchinkov’s, and the porter showed him right to the door. Halfway up the stairs, he could hear a lively crowd chatting away. The door was wide open, and he caught snippets of exclamations and discussions. Razumihin’s room was pretty spacious, filled with about fifteen people. Raskolnikov paused in the entryway, where two of the landlady’s servants were busy behind a screen with samovars, bottles, plates, and dishes of pie and snacks from the kitchen.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels a surge of pride and self-confidence as he contemplates his life and the possibility of change."
