  "text": "Sonia is in a tough spot. She’s trying to keep the kids together, making them sing and dance for cash. They’re out there, begging under the general’s window, looking like well-off kids but struggling hard. Katerina is losing it—she’s beating the kids, and they’re all just crying. She’s got Lida singing “My Village,” the boy dancing, and Polenka doing the same. She’s even ripping up their clothes to make little actor caps. Instead of music, she wants them to jingle a tin basin. It’s chaos! 😩\n\nLebeziatnikov is rambling, but Sonia can’t take it anymore. She grabs her cloak and hat and bolts out of the room, getting dressed on the way. Raskolnikov follows her, and Lebeziatnikov trails behind.\n\n“She’s definitely lost it!” he tells Raskolnikov outside. “I didn’t want to scare Sonia, so I said it seemed like it, but there’s no doubt. They say with consumption, tubercles can mess with the brain. I wish I knew more about medicine. I tried to talk sense into her, but she wouldn’t listen.”\n\n“Did you mention the tubercles?” Raskolnikov asks.\n\n“Not exactly. She wouldn’t get it! But I believe if you can convince someone logically that they have no reason to cry, they’ll stop. That makes sense, right?”\n\n“Life would be too simple if it worked that way,” Raskolnikov replies.\n\n“Yeah, I guess it would be,” Lebeziatnikov concedes.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna is exhibiting signs of madness, causing distress among those around her."
