  "text": "Svidrigaïlov grabbed a candle, threw on his waistcoat, overcoat, and hat, and stepped out into the hallway to find the ragged attendant. He needed to pay for his room and get out of the hotel. \"This is the perfect time,\" he thought.\n\nHe wandered down a long, narrow corridor, but no one was around. Just as he was about to call out, he spotted something odd in a dark corner between an old cupboard and the door. Leaning down with the candle, he discovered a little girl, maybe five years old, shivering and crying. Her clothes were soaked through, like a wet dishcloth. \n\nShe didn’t seem scared of him. Instead, she stared at him with wide, confused eyes. Occasionally, she sobbed like kids do when they've been crying for a while but are starting to calm down. Her face was pale and tired; she was freezing. “How did she end up here? She must have hidden and not slept all night,” he thought.\n\nHe started asking her questions. Suddenly, she perked up and babbled in her little-kid language about \"mammy\" and how \"mammy would beat her\" for breaking a cup. She kept talking non-stop. From her words, it was clear she was neglected. Her mom, probably a drunk cook at the hotel, scared and punished her. The girl had broken a cup and, terrified, had run away the night before, hiding for a long time.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov discovers a neglected, shivering little girl hiding in a dark corner of the hotel, revealing her fear of her mother and the harshness of her situation."
