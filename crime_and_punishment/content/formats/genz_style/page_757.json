The future looked like a never-ending sacrifice that led nowhere. What was the point of waiting eight years to be thirty-two and start fresh? What was there to live for? What was he looking forward to? Why bother trying? Just to exist? He had been ready to give up everything for an idea, a hope, or even just a whim. Mere existence felt like way too little for him; he always wanted more. Maybe that’s why he thought he could reach for more than others.\n\nIf only fate had thrown him some intense regret—something that would tear at his heart and keep him up at night. That kind of regret, the kind that makes you think of hanging or drowning, would have made him feel alive! But he didn’t regret his crime.\n\nHe could have at least vented his frustration at his own foolishness, like he had done with the ridiculous mistakes that landed him in prison. But now, in prison—or even when he was free—he reevaluated his actions and didn’t see them as foolish or ridiculous as he once had.\n\nHe wondered, “How was my theory any dumber than all the others that have clashed throughout history?
