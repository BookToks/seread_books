The rundown tavern, his rough look, five nights in a hay barge, and the booze—yet his deep love for his wife and kids left Raskolnikov confused. Raskolnikov listened closely but felt sick. He regretted coming here.\n\n“Honored sir,” Marmeladov said, regaining his composure. “Maybe this seems funny to you, like it does to others. But it’s no joke for me. I feel it all… I dreamt about how I’d fix everything—dress the kids, give my wife a break, save my daughter from shame, bring her back to the family. All that stuff… totally normal, right? Well, the day after those dreams—five days ago—I pulled a sneaky move. Like a thief in the night, I took the key to Katerina Ivanovna’s box, grabbed what was left of my earnings (I don’t even remember how much), and look at me now! It’s been five days since I left home. They’re looking for me, and I lost my job. My uniform? It’s sitting in a tavern on the Egyptian bridge. I traded it for these clothes I’m wearing… and that’s it.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marmeladov expresses his deep love for his family despite his degradation and despair, revealing his struggles with addiction and the consequences of his actions."
