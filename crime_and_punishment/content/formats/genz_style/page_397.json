It can’t be!’ he finally said, bewildered. \n\nThe visitor didn’t seem shocked at all. \n\n‘I’m here for two reasons. First, I wanted to meet you because I’ve heard a lot of cool and flattering things about you. Second, I hope you’ll help me with something important regarding your sister, Avdotya Romanovna. Without your support, she won’t let me near her—she’s got some serious biases against me. But with your help, I think I can…’ \n\n‘You’re wrong about that,’ Raskolnikov cut in. \n\n‘Did they just arrive yesterday, may I ask?’ \n\nRaskolnikov stayed silent. \n\n‘It was yesterday, I know. I got here the day before. Look, Rodion Romanovitch, I don’t feel the need to justify myself, but can you tell me what I did that was so wrong in this whole situation? Just being real here.’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov visits Raskolnikov to seek his support regarding Raskolnikov's sister, Avdotya, despite Raskolnikov's evident distrust."
