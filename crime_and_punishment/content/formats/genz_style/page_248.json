Tailors get them every Saturday by mail from abroad to show people how to dress—both guys and girls. The guys usually rock fur coats, and the ladies’ outfits? They're next level.’  \n‘You can find anything in Petersburg,’ the younger one exclaimed, ‘except for mom and dad. Everything else is here!’  \n‘Yeah, except them, you can find it all, kid,’ the older one said seriously.  \n\nRaskolnikov stood up and moved to the other room, where the strong box, bed, and chest of drawers used to be. It felt super tiny without any furniture. The wallpaper was the same, and in the corner, he could see where the ikon case had been. He stared at it and walked over to the window. The older workman eyed him suspiciously.  \n‘What do you want?’ he asked suddenly.  \n\nInstead of answering, Raskolnikov stepped into the hallway and rang the bell. Same bell, same cracked sound. He rang it again and again, listening as memories flooded back. The horrible, gut-wrenching feeling from before started creeping back, and with each ring, he shuddered but felt a strange satisfaction.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a haunting mix of nostalgia and dread as he revisits a flat associated with a past crime."
