  "text": "\"Who sent you?\"  \n\"Sister Sonia sent me,\" the girl replied, her smile getting even brighter.  \n\"I knew it was her.\"  \n\"Mamma sent me too. When Sister Sonia was sending me, Mamma came up and said, 'Run fast, Polenka.'\"  \n\"Do you love Sister Sonia?\"  \n\"I love her more than anyone,\" Polenka said seriously, her smile fading a bit.  \n\"And will you love me?\"  \nIn response, the little girl leaned in, her soft lips puckered for a kiss. Suddenly, her thin arms wrapped around him tightly, and her head rested on his shoulder as she cried softly, pressing her face against him.  \n\"I feel sorry for Father,\" she said after a moment, lifting her tear-streaked face and wiping her cheeks with her hands. \"It’s just misfortunes now,\" she added, trying to sound grown-up.  \n\"Did your father love you?\"  \n\"He loved Lida the most,\" she said seriously, no smile in sight, just like an adult. \"He loved her because she’s little and sick. He always brought her presents. But he taught us how to read, and me grammar and scripture too,\" she added with pride. \"Mother didn’t say much, but we knew she liked it, and Father knew too. Now, Mother wants to teach me French because it’s time for my education to start.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Polenka expresses her deep love for her sister Sonia and reflects on her family's misfortunes and her father's affections."
