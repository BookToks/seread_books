  "text": "Polenka was crying. Sonia was behind them, praying softly and tearing up too. \n\n“Why hasn’t she said a word to me in two days? Not even a glance,” Raskolnikov thought. The sunlight flooded the room, and incense filled the air. The priest was reading, “Give rest, oh Lord….” Raskolnikov stayed for the whole service. When the priest blessed them and left, he shot Raskolnikov a strange look. \n\nAfter the service, Raskolnikov approached Sonia. She took his hands and rested her head on his shoulder. This simple gesture threw him off. It felt odd that she showed no disgust, no hesitation, no tremor in her hands. To him, it was the ultimate act of selflessness. \n\nSonia didn’t say anything. Raskolnikov squeezed her hand and walked away, feeling miserable. If he could just escape to some quiet place, he’d consider himself lucky—even if it meant spending his whole life there. But even when he was alone lately, he never really felt lonely. \n\nSometimes he’d walk out of town to the main road, and once he even found a little wood. But the more isolated the spot, the more he sensed an uneasy presence nearby. It didn’t scare him, but it irritated him enough to rush back to town, to blend in with the crowd, hit up restaurants and taverns, and stroll through busy streets. There, he felt lighter, even if he was still alone. One evening, he spent an hour listening to music in a tavern and realized he actually enjoyed it. But eventually…\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a profound sense of misery and confusion as he grapples with his feelings for Sonia and his inability to find solitude or peace."
