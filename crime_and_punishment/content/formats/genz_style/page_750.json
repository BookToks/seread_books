  "text": "Raskolnikov‚Äôs mom, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, steered the convo in a way that made it impossible to avoid talking about where Rodya was. When she got vague and suspicious answers, she fell into a gloomy silence that dragged on. Dounia realized it was tough to keep her in the dark and figured it was better to just stay quiet about some things. But it was clear that the poor mom suspected something was seriously wrong.\n\nDounia remembered her brother saying their mom had overheard her talking in her sleep after her meeting with Svidriga√Ølov, right before the big confession. Did she piece something together from that? Sometimes, her days would be filled with tears and silence, only to be followed by bursts of wild energy where she‚Äôd talk non-stop about her son and her hopes for his future. Some of her ideas were pretty out there. They humored her and pretended to agree (she probably knew they were faking it), but she kept chatting away.\n\nFive months after Raskolnikov confessed, he was sentenced. Razumihin and Sonia visited him in prison whenever they could. Finally, the moment of separation hit hard. Dounia promised her brother that they wouldn‚Äôt be apart forever, and Razumihin made the same vow. In his youthful enthusiasm, he was determined to build a stable life over the next few years. He planned to save up and move to Siberia, a place full of natural resources and job opportunities. That‚Äôs where they would start fresh. üåç\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pulcheria Alexandrovna's growing suspicion about her son Rodya's situation leads to a prolonged period of gloom and silence in the family, despite their attempts to maintain hope."
