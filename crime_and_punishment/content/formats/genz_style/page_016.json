He mumbled something about bringing Alyona Ivanovna a silver cigarette box soon, but he trailed off, unsure of himself. \n\n“Let’s talk about it later,” she replied, not really interested. \n\n“Are you always alone? Where’s your sister?” he asked, trying to sound casual as he stepped into the hallway. \n\n“Why do you care?” she shot back. \n\n“Just curious. Chill out. Goodbye, Alyona Ivanovna.” \n\nAs he left, his confusion only grew. He paused on the stairs a couple of times, like he was hit by a sudden thought. Once outside, he yelled, “Oh God, this is all so disgusting! How could I even think that? It’s nonsense!” He shook his head. “What horrible things my heart can come up with. It’s just filthy, gross, loathsome! And I’ve been thinking about this for a whole month…” \n\nWords couldn’t capture how he felt. The intense disgust that had been building up inside him on the way to the old woman was now overwhelming. He didn’t know how to escape this misery. Stumbling along the sidewalk, he bumped into people without even noticing, lost in his own thoughts.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences intense confusion and repulsion after a troubling encounter with Alyona Ivanovna, reflecting on the dark thoughts that have plagued him."
