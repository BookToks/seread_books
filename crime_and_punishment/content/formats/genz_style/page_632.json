  "text": "I'm not trying to make a big deal out of this; I'm just sharing what I noticed back then. Honestly, it might not mean anything at all. And it’s definitely not cool for a prosecutor to get swept up in feelings. I have Nikolay here, and he’s got real evidence against him—whether you like it or not, it’s there. \n\nWe’ve got to think about his mindset too; this is life or death stuff. Why am I telling you all this? So you get why I acted the way I did. It wasn’t out of spite, I promise! 😅 \n\nYou think I didn’t check your room? I totally did! I was around when you were sick in bed—not officially, of course, but I was here. Your place got searched thoroughly at the first hint of trouble, but it came up empty! I figured you’d show up soon if you were guilty. Most people would run, but not you. \n\nRemember how Mr. Razumihin started talking to you about it? We set that up to get a reaction from you. We spread some rumors on purpose, knowing Razumihin wouldn’t hold back his feelings. Mr. Zametov was really surprised by your anger and boldness. I mean, saying “I killed her” in a restaurant? That’s next-level reckless. I thought, if he’s guilty, he’s going to be a tough opponent. That’s what I was thinking back then. I was ready for you. But you just surprised us all.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The prosecutor reflects on the psychological complexities of guilt and evidence in a murder case, revealing his strategic approach to uncovering the truth."
