He was still lying there. The tea was untouched. Nastasya felt annoyed and started shaking him awake. \n\n“Why are you lying there like a dead fish?” she yelled, looking at him with disgust. \n\nHe got up, sat back down, and just stared at the floor. \n\n“Are you sick or not?” she asked again, but he stayed silent. “You should go outside for some fresh air. Are you going to eat or what?” \n\n“Later,” he replied weakly, waving her away. \n\nShe lingered a moment, looked at him with pity, then left. \n\nA few minutes later, he finally lifted his gaze and stared at the tea and soup.

His head started to ache less after he ate.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov struggles with illness and apathy while being cared for by Nastasya, who is concerned about his well-being."
