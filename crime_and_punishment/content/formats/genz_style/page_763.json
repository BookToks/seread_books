  "text": "Easter had arrived, bringing warm, sunny spring days. In the prison ward, the windows were opened, letting in fresh air while the guard paced below. Sonia had managed to visit Raskolnikov only twice during his illness, and it was a hassle to get permission each time. But she often came to the hospital yard, especially in the evenings, sometimes just to stand for a moment and gaze up at his window.\n\nOne evening, when he was almost back to normal, Raskolnikov fell asleep. When he woke up and went to the window, he spotted Sonia in the distance at the hospital gate, looking like she was waiting for someone. A sudden pang hit him in the heart, making him shudder as he stepped back from the window. The next day, Sonia didn’t show up, nor the day after that. He found himself anxiously waiting for her. Finally, he got discharged. Once back at the prison, he heard from the other inmates that Sofya Semyonovna was sick at home and couldn’t go out.\n\nWorried, he sent someone to check on her. Soon, he found out her illness wasn’t serious. Knowing he was concerned, Sonia sent him a quick note saying she was feeling better, just had a slight cold, and would visit him soon at work. His heart raced painfully as he read her words.\n\nIt was another warm, sunny day. Early in the morning, at six o’clock, he headed to work by the riverbank, where they pounded alabaster and had a kiln in a shed. Only three of them were sent out that day. One of the convicts went with the guard to the fortress.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences deep emotional turmoil and concern for Sonia's health while recovering in prison during Easter."
