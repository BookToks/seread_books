Here’s the plan: I’d grab the loot and head straight to some remote spot—like a hidden garden or something. I’d find a heavy stone, one that’s been there forever. I’d lift it up, stash the money and jewels in the hole underneath, then roll the stone back like nothing happened. For a year or two, maybe three, I wouldn’t touch it.
