You’re gonna drive me nuts too… why did you even come here, seriously?’  \n‘I’m not here for… translation,’ Raskolnikov muttered from the stairs.  \n‘Then what do you want?’ Razumihin shouted back. Raskolnikov just kept going down the stairs in silence.  \n‘Hey! Where are you living?’  \nNo response.  \n‘Fine, whatever!’  \nBut Raskolnikov was already out the door. On the Nikolaevsky Bridge, he snapped back to reality after a rude wake-up call. A coachman, after yelling at him a few times, gave him a hard whip on the back for almost stepping under the horses' hooves. That made him furious. He rushed to the railing (for some reason, he had been walking right in the middle of the bridge, in the way). He clenched his fists and gritted his teeth. Laughter echoed around him, of course.  \n‘Serves him right!’  \n‘Probably a pickpocket.’  \n‘Pretending to be drunk, definitely, trying to get run over on purpose; and we have to deal with him.’  \n‘It’s like a whole profession for these guys.’  \nWhile he stood there, still fuming and confused, watching the carriage drive away, he rubbed his back.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, in a state of confusion and anger, faces the disdain of passersby after a coachman lashes him for nearly stepping into traffic."
