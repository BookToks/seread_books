  "text": "And get this: Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock, the civil counselor—ever heard of him?—still hasn’t paid Katerina for those six linen shirts she made. He kicked her out, yelling about how the collars were messed up. Meanwhile, the kids are starving. 😟 Katerina is pacing around, hands wringing, cheeks flushed (that’s from her illness), saying, “You live here, eat, drink, and stay warm, but you don’t lift a finger to help!” Not that there’s much to eat anyway; the kids haven’t had a crust for three days! \n\nI was lying there, well, drunk, when I heard Sonia talking. She’s this sweet girl with soft hair and a pale, thin face. She asked, “Katerina Ivanovna, am I really supposed to do that?” Darya Frantsovna, a shady lady known by the cops, had tried to get to Sonia through the landlady a couple of times. Katerina shot back with a sneer, “And why not? You’re so special to be careful of!” But don’t blame her! Seriously, don’t! She was totally out of it, stressed from her illness and the kids crying. It was more to hurt Sonia than anything else. That’s just how Katerina is—when the kids cry, even if it's from hunger, she starts hitting them right away. \n\nAt six, I saw Sonia get up, put on her kerchief and cape, and leave. She came back around nine. She walked straight up to Katerina.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna struggles with poverty and desperation, driven to distraction by her family's hunger and illness."
