  "text": "A guy who looked like a craftsman was sitting in front of a beer, a bit tipsy but not completely wasted. His buddy, a big dude with a gray beard, was totally out of it, snoozing on a bench. Every so often, he’d wake up, flail his arms, and hum some random tune, trying to remember lyrics like:\n\n“His wife a year he fondly loved, His wife a—a year he—fondly loved.”\n\nThen he’d suddenly snap awake and mumble:\n\n“Walking along the crowded row, He met the one he used to know.”\n\nBut no one was vibing with him. His quiet friend shot him looks of pure annoyance and distrust. There was also another guy in the corner, probably a retired government worker. He was sipping his drink and glancing around, clearly on edge.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov observes a drunken man in a tavern, highlighting the contrasting emotions and social dynamics present in the scene."
