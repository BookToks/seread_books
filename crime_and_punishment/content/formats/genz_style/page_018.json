  "text": "Raskolnikov spotted a guy who looked like a craftsman. He was tipsy, but not totally wasted, sitting in front of a beer. Next to him was a big dude with a gray beard, completely zonked out in a short coat. He’d drift in and out of sleep, sometimes flailing his arms and humming a random tune, trying to remember lines like:\n\n“His wife a year he fondly loved  \nHis wife a—a year he—  \nfondly loved.”\n\nThen he’d suddenly snap awake and mumble:\n\n“Walking along the crowded row  \nHe met the one he used to know.”\n\nBut no one was vibing with him. His quiet buddy shot him looks filled with suspicion. There was also another guy in the corner who seemed like a retired clerk. He sipped his drink and scanned the room, looking a bit restless himself.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov observes a drunken man in a tavern, highlighting the contrasting reactions of the patrons to his antics."
