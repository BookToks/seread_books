  "text": "Raskolnikov saw a dude who looked like a craftsman, tipsy but not totally wasted, chilling in front of a beer. His buddy was a big, stout guy with a grey beard, wearing a short coat. This guy was super drunk and had passed out on the bench. Occasionally, he'd wake up, crack his fingers, and move around like he was having a mini party, humming some random tune, trying to remember lines like:\n\n‘His wife a year he fondly loved His wife a—a year he—fondly loved.’\n\nThen he'd suddenly snap awake and mumble:\n\n‘Walking along the crowded row He met the one he used to know.’\n\nBut no one was vibing with him. His silent friend was giving off major negative energy, looking at him like he was suspicious. There was also another guy in the room who seemed like a retired government worker. He was off to the side, sipping from his drink and glancing around at everyone, looking a bit anxious. 🍻\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov observes a drunken man in a tavern, highlighting the contrasting emotions and behaviors of the patrons around him."
