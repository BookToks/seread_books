  "text": "‘But honestly, if you wouldn’t do it yourself, is it really fair? Let’s play another round.’ \n\nRaskolnikov was super shaken. Sure, it was just typical young people’s chatter—stuff he’d heard before in different ways and about different topics. But why did he have to stumble upon this convo right when he was cooking up the same thoughts? And why, right after he’d been thinking about that old woman, did he hear people talking about her? This coincidence felt weird. That random tavern talk ended up having a huge impact on what he did later, like it was somehow meant to be, or a hint from the universe… \n\n*****\n\nWhen he got back from the Hay Market, he collapsed on the sofa and stayed there for an hour without moving. It got dark, but he didn’t bother to light a candle. Honestly, he couldn’t even remember if he was thinking about anything. Eventually, he felt that familiar fever and chills again, and he was relieved to just lie down. Soon, a heavy sleep hit him, like a weight pressing down. \n\nHe slept for a crazy long time and didn’t dream at all. Nastasya came into his room around ten the next morning and had a hard time waking him up. She brought him tea and bread. The tea was again the second brew and in her own teapot. \n\n‘Wow, he really sleeps like a rock!’ she exclaimed, annoyed.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a disturbing coincidence that influences his thoughts on morality and crime while grappling with his own feverish state."
