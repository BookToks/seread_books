  "text": "Dounia asked, “What did you tell him?”  \n“I first said I wouldn’t pass on any message to you. Then he claimed he’d try to meet you without my help. He insisted his feelings for you were just a phase and that he doesn’t want you marrying Luzhin. Honestly, his talk was pretty jumbled.”  \n\n“How do you see him, Rodya? What’s your take?”  \n“I have to admit, I don’t really get him. He offers you ten grand but says he’s broke. He says he’s leaving, then forgets and talks about getting married to someone else. He definitely has some motive, probably a bad one. But if he’s plotting against you, he’s being really clumsy about it. I turned down his money for your sake. Overall, he just seems odd. One could almost think he’s lost it. But maybe that’s just an act. The death of Marfa Petrovna clearly hit him hard.”  \n\n“God rest her soul,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna said. “I’ll always pray for her! Where would we be now, Dounia, without that three thousand? It’s like it dropped from the sky! This morning, we only had three roubles and were about to pawn your watch to avoid borrowing money.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses confusion about Svidrigaïlov's strange behavior and motives regarding Dounia, while Pulcheria Alexandrovna feels grateful for a financial windfall after Marfa Petrovna's death."
