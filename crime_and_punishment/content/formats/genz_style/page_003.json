  "text": "This guy, Dostoevsky, faced some serious stuff. He was sentenced to death by a tough judge (that “stern and just man,” as Maurice Baring puts it). After eight months in jail, he and twenty-one others were marched to Semyonovsky Square to be shot. In a letter to his brother Mihail, he wrote about how they made them wear white shirts (the uniform for death row). They were tied to stakes, and he thought he only had minutes to live. He said goodbye to his buddies, Plestcheiev and Dourov. \n\nBut then, out of nowhere, the soldiers played a drum roll, and they were untied and taken back. They got the news that the Emperor decided to spare their lives. Instead of death, they were sent to hard labor. \n\nOne guy, Grigoryev, totally lost it right after they untied him and never recovered. This whole nightmare hit Dostoevsky hard. Even though his faith helped him accept his suffering as a blessing, he kept writing about it. He explored the pain of being condemned and called out the cruelty of such punishment. After that, he spent four years in a Siberian prison with common criminals, where he started working on “Dead House.” He also served time in a disciplinary battalion. Before his arrest, he had some weird nervous issues, and they got way worse during this time.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dostoevsky's near-execution and subsequent imprisonment profoundly influenced his writing and views on suffering and cruelty."
