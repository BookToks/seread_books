After eight months in jail, he and twenty-one others were taken to Semyonovsky Square to be executed. Dostoevsky wrote to his brother Mihail: “They were saying things over us, and we had to wear white shirts, like people about to be executed. We were tied in threes to stakes, ready for death. Since I was third in line, I thought I only had a few minutes left. I thought of you and your loved ones, and I managed to kiss Plestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, to say goodbye. Suddenly, the soldiers played a beat, we were untied, brought back to the scaffold, and told that the king had spared our lives.” The sentence was changed to hard labor.\n\nOne prisoner, Grigoryev, lost his mind as soon as he was untied and never recovered. \n\nThis intense suffering left a huge mark on Dostoevsky’s mind. Even though his faith made him accept suffering as a blessing in the end, he often wrote about it. He described the terrible pain of the condemned and highlighted the cruelty of such torture. After that, he spent four years in hard labor with common criminals in Siberia, where he began writing ‘Dead House,’ and also served in a disciplinary battalion. Before his arrest, he had shown signs of a mysterious nervous illness, which now turned into violent attacks.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dostoevsky's near-execution and subsequent imprisonment profoundly influenced his writing and views on suffering and cruelty."
