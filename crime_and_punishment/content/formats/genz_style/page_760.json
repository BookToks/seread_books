  "text": "Raskolnikov felt totally alone. Everyone avoided him, and soon, they even started to hate him. He didn’t get why. Some guys who had done way worse laughed at his crime. “You’re a gentleman,” they’d say. “Real gentlemen don’t go around swinging axes.” \n\nDuring the second week of Lent, it was his turn to take the sacrament with his group. He went to church and prayed like everyone else. But then, out of nowhere, a fight broke out. They all turned on him, yelling, “You’re an infidel! You don’t believe in God. You should be killed!” \n\nHe hadn’t even talked to them about God or his beliefs, but they were ready to attack him just for that. He stayed silent. One prisoner charged at him, wild with rage. Raskolnikov just stood there, calm and unflinching. Thankfully, the guard stepped in before things got violent. \n\nAnother mystery was why everyone loved Sonia so much. She didn’t try to win them over and rarely visited. Yet, they all knew her story—how she came to follow him and where she lived. She didn’t give them money or do anything special for them. The only time she sent them anything was at Christmas when she gifted them pies and rolls. Still, over time, they formed a bond with her.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels isolated and despised by fellow prisoners, contrasting their love for life with his own turmoil, while Sonia earns their affection despite her minimal interactions."
