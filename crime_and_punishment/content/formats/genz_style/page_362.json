  "text": "Raskolnikov is on edge. Why can’t Razumihin see it? That clueless guy never notices anything! Is Porfiry messing with me? Probably just my nerves acting up. Are they trying to get under my skin? Either I’m imagining things, or they know something. Even Zametov's acting weird. Has he turned rude? He’s definitely changed. He’s comfortable here, while I’m the newbie. Porfiry treats him like a buddy, totally ignoring me. No doubt they’ve been talking about me before I showed up. Do they know about the flat? I wish they’d hurry up! When I mentioned I ran off to get a flat, he didn’t even react. I was clever to drop that in; it could come in handy later. Am I losing it? Ha! He must know what went down last night. He didn’t know my mom was in town, though! She wrote the date in pencil, so he’s clueless. You won’t catch me, I swear! There are no real facts here, just guesses! Show me the facts! The flat? Just a figment of my imagination. I can handle this. Do they know about the flat? I need answers. Why did I even come here? But hey, maybe my anger is real! Ugh, I’m such a mess! Maybe I should act sick. He’s definitely probing for info. Why did I come here again? \n\nAll these thoughts raced through his mind. \n\nPorfiry Petrovitch came back, looking more cheerful. \n\n“Your party yesterday really messed with my head, brother. I’m feeling off today,” he said, sounding a bit different.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is consumed by paranoia and anxiety about being scrutinized by Porfiry and others regarding his actions."
