  "text": "**Chapter VIII**\n\nWhen he walked into Sonia’s room, it was already getting dark. Sonia had been waiting for him all day, stressed out. Dounia was there with her, remembering what Svidrigaïlov had said about Sonia knowing things. \n\nWe won’t dive into their chat or the tears they shared, but they really bonded. Dounia found some comfort knowing her brother wouldn’t be alone. He had gone to Sonia first to confess and seek connection when he needed it most. Dounia didn’t have to ask; she just knew she’d stick by him, no matter what. She looked at Sonia with a kind of admiration that made Sonia feel a bit shy. Honestly, Sonia felt unworthy to meet Dounia’s gaze. That moment when Dounia had bowed to her back in Raskolnikov’s room? It was one of the most beautiful memories Sonia had.\n\nEventually, Dounia got restless and left Sonia to wait for her brother in his room, thinking he’d come there first. Once she was gone, Sonia couldn’t shake the fear that he might take his own life, and Dounia felt the same way. They had spent the day trying to convince each other that wouldn’t happen, but it was hard.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia and Dounia anxiously await Raskolnikov, finding comfort in their bond as they fear for his well-being."
