He had to move fast. \n\nHe crouched down, grabbed a stone, and flipped it over with all his strength. Underneath, he found a small hollow. He dumped his pocket into it, with the purse on top. Still, the hole wasn’t full. He flipped the stone back into place, leaving it slightly raised. He packed the dirt around it with his foot. Perfect—no one would notice.\n\nStepping out, he entered the square. A wave of joy hit him, almost too much to handle, just like at the police station. \"I’ve covered my tracks! Who would ever think to check under that stone? It’s been there forever and will stay there for ages. If it’s found, no one will connect it to me. It’s done! No clues!\" He laughed, a thin, nervous sound that echoed as he crossed the square.\n\nBut when he reached K—— Boulevard, where he had seen that girl two days ago, his laughter stopped. Dark thoughts crept in. He felt sick at the idea of passing the spot where he had sat, thinking after she left. He didn’t want to relive that moment.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist experiences a mix of intense joy and anxiety after burying evidence of his crime, believing he has successfully hidden his tracks."
