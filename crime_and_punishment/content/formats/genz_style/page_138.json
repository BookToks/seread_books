  "text": "“Open up, you idiot! Wake up!” \n\n“What do they want? Why’s the porter here? Everything’s out in the open. Should I resist or just open the door? …” \n\nHe half-stood, leaned forward, and unlatched the door. His room was so tiny that he could do it without getting out of bed. The porter and Nastasya were right there. \n\nNastasya looked at him oddly. He shot a desperate, defiant glance at the porter, who silently handed him a gray paper sealed with wax. \n\n“A notice from the office,” the porter said. \n\n“From what office?” \n\n“A summons to the police office, obviously. You know which one.” \n\n“To the police? … What for? …” \n\n“Not my job to know. You’re called in, so you go.” \n\nThe porter studied him, glanced around the room, then turned to leave. \n\n“He’s really sick!” Nastasya said, still watching him. The porter looked back for a moment. “He’s been burning up with fever since yesterday,” she added. \n\nRaskolnikov didn’t respond and held the paper without opening it. “Just stay in bed,” Nastasya said kindly when she saw him letting his feet touch the floor. “You’re sick, so don’t rush. What’s that in your hand?” \n\nHe looked down. In his right hand, he clutched the scraps he had cut from his trousers, a sock, and some rags from his pocket.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov receives a summons to the police office while grappling with illness and anxiety over his situation."
