It’s furnished, the rent’s chill, and it has three rooms. Why don’t you guys take it for now? I’ll pawn your watch tomorrow and get you the cash. We can sort everything out then. You all can live together, and Rodya can be with you. But where are you headed, Rodya?”\n\n“What? Rodya, you’re leaving already?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked, shocked.\n\n“Right now?” Razumihin exclaimed.\n\nDounia looked at her brother, confused. He held his cap and seemed ready to go.\n\n“You’d think I was being buried or saying goodbye forever,” he said, sounding a bit off. He tried to smile, but it didn’t really work. “But who knows, maybe this is the last time we’ll see each other…” he let that slip. It was on his mind, and it came out.\n\n“What’s wrong with you?” his mom asked.\n\n“Where are you going, Rodya?” Dounia asked, her tone strange.\n\n“Oh, I have to…” he replied vaguely, as if he was unsure of what to say. But his pale face showed clear determination.\n\n“I wanted to say… as I was coming here… I meant to tell you, Mom, and you, Dounia, that it’s better if we take a break for a while. I feel sick, and I’m not at peace…”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Rodya expresses a desire to part from his family temporarily due to his feelings of illness and unrest."
