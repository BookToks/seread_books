  "text": "Dounia was clearly shaken by Svidrigaïlov’s offer. She stood there, deep in thought. “He’s got some awful plan,” she murmured, almost shivering. \n\nRaskolnikov picked up on her fear. “Looks like I’ll have to meet him again,” he told Dounia. \n\nRazumihin jumped in, full of energy. “We’ll keep an eye on him! I won’t let him out of my sight. Rodya told me to look after you, so I’m on it! Can I get your blessing too, Avdotya Romanovna?” \n\nDounia smiled and reached out her hand, but her worry was still visible. Pulcheria Alexandrovna looked at her nervously, yet the three thousand roubles seemed to calm her down. \n\nA little later, they were all chatting excitedly. Raskolnikov listened quietly, even though he didn’t join in. Razumihin was the one talking. \n\n“Why would you leave?” he said passionately. “What’s waiting for you in a small town? The important thing is that you’re all together right now—you really need each other, trust me. For now, at least… Let me in on your plans, and I promise we’ll come up with something great. I had this idea this morning, before anything went down… Oh! I have an uncle I want you to meet (he’s a solid guy).”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia feels a sense of unease about Svidrigaïlov's intentions, prompting Raskolnikov and Razumihin to vow to protect her."
