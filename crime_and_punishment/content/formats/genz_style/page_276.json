  "text": "Raskolnikov and Razumihin were quiet for a moment. Then Raskolnikov said, “Listen, I need to be real with you. I just came from a deathbed—some clerk who died. I gave them all my cash. Plus, I got kissed by someone who, if I had killed anyone, wouldn’t care at all. I also saw someone else there with a bright feather. But I’m rambling. I feel so weak; can you help me up the stairs?”\n\nRazumihin looked worried. “What’s going on? Are you okay?”\n\n“I’m a bit dizzy, but that’s not the main issue. I feel so sad... like a girl. Look over there! What’s that?” \n\n“What's what?” \n\n“Can’t you see? There’s a light in my room! Look through the crack!” \n\nThey reached the last flight of stairs, right by the landlady’s door. Sure enough, there was a light shining in Raskolnikov’s room.\n\n“Strange! Maybe it’s Nastasya,” Razumihin suggested.\n\n“She’s never in my room at this hour. She should be asleep by now, but whatever! I’m out. Goodbye!” \n\n“What do you mean? I’m coming with you. We’ll go in together!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses his sadness and confusion to Razumihin after a troubling experience at a death-bed, indicating his emotional turmoil."
