  "text": "Luzhin, with a polite bow to Razumihin, started off by saying he felt insulted. He claimed that during a private chat over coffee, he expressed that marrying a poor girl who's faced hard times is better than marrying someone who's lived in luxury. He argued it’s good for moral character. But Luzhin said Razumihin twisted his words, making him look bad and suggesting he had bad intentions. He was clearly banking on the letters between him and Pulcheria Alexandrovna (Rodion's mom).\n\n“Please, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, I’d be glad if you could prove me wrong and ease my mind. Can you tell me exactly what you said in your letter to Rodion?” \n\n“I don’t remember,” Pulcheria replied, sounding unsure. “I just repeated what I understood. Maybe Rodya (Rodion) took it too far.”\n\n“He couldn’t have exaggerated unless you pushed him to,” Luzhin shot back.\n\n“Pyotr Petrovitch,” Pulcheria said, standing her ground, “the fact that Dounia and I are here shows we didn’t take your words the wrong way.”\n\n“Good one, Mom,” Dounia chimed in, backing her up.\n\n“Great, now I’m at fault again,” Luzhin said, clearly annoyed.\n\n“Look, Pyotr Petrovitch, you keep blaming Rodion, but you just wrote something false about him,” Pulcheria added, gaining some confidence. \n\n“I don’t remember writing anything false,” Luzhin retorted.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Luzhin accuses Raskolnikov of misrepresenting his words, while Pulcheria Alexandrovna defends her son and challenges Luzhin's claims."
