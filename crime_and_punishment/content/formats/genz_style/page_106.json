  "text": "For a moment, he actually believed he could pull off his plan. If everything had been figured out perfectly, with no doubts left, he probably would’ve thought it was all ridiculous and impossible. But there were still a ton of uncertainties hanging over him. \n\nGetting the axe? That was easy. Nastasya was always out, especially at night. She’d pop over to neighbors or run to a shop, leaving the door wide open—something the landlady constantly nagged her about. So, when the time came, he could sneak into the kitchen, grab the axe, and an hour later, after it was all done, just put it back. \n\nBut what if he returned and Nastasya was back? He’d have to wait for her to leave again. And if she noticed the axe was missing and started looking for it? That would raise suspicions, or at least make people wonder.\n\nBut those were just minor details he hadn’t even started to think about, and honestly, he didn’t have time for that. He was focused on the big picture and pushed aside the little stuff until he could really believe in the plan. But that felt totally out of reach. He couldn’t even picture himself just getting up and going for it. Even his last attempt (you know, that little test he tried) was a mess.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist grapples with uncertainties and doubts about executing his plans, feeling overwhelmed by the complexities involved."
