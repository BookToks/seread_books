He didn’t even try to move; he just stared at the flower. \n\n“But what about the painter?” Zossimov cut in, clearly annoyed by Nastasya’s chatter. She sighed and went quiet. \n\n“Well, he was accused of murder,” Razumihin said, getting fired up. \n\n“Was there any real evidence against him?” \n\n“Evidence? More like fake evidence! That’s what we need to prove. They just picked on those guys, Koch and Pestryakov, right away. It’s all so dumb it makes me sick, even if it’s not my problem! Pestryakov might show up tonight. By the way, Rodya, you’ve heard about this already; it happened before you got sick, the day before you fainted at the police station while they were discussing it.”\n\nZossimov glanced at Raskolnikov, who didn’t move. \n\n“Seriously, Razumihin, you’re such a busybody!” Zossimov said. \n\n“Yeah, maybe I am, but we’re going to get him off!” Razumihin shouted, slamming his fist on the table. “What’s really annoying isn’t the lying—lying can be fun because it can lead to the truth. What’s offensive is that they lie and actually believe their own lies. I respect Porfiry, but… what started this mess? The door was locked, and when they came back with the porter, it was open. So, of course, Koch and Pestryakov were suspects.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin expresses frustration over the flawed evidence and dishonesty surrounding a murder accusation against a painter."
