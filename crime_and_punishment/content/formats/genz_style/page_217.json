The idea is pretty straightforward, but it took way too long to get here, held back by idealism and sentimentality (basically, too much thinking and not enough action). Honestly, it shouldn't take a genius to see this…\n\n“Sorry, I’m not exactly a genius myself,” Razumihin interrupted sharply. “Let’s just drop it. I started this convo with a point, but I’m so over this endless chatter. It’s the same boring stuff every time. Honestly, I cringe when I hear others talk like that. I get it—you want to show off what you know. That’s cool. But I just wanted to figure out what kind of person you are.

That’s enough!” \n\n“Excuse me, sir,” Luzhin said, clearly offended, trying to sound dignified. “Are you implying that I…?”\n\n“Oh, come on! How could I?
