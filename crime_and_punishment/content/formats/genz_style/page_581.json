It’s like I can’t handle my own problems, so I’m throwing them onto you. Now you’re suffering too, and somehow that makes me feel a bit better! But how can you love someone so pathetic?”\n\n“But aren’t you hurting too?” Sonia asked.\n\nHis heart felt heavy again, and for a moment, it softened.\n\n“Sonia, I’ve got a bad heart—just so you know. That explains a lot. I came here because I’m messed up. Some guys wouldn’t have shown up, but I’m a coward and… a pathetic loser. But forget that for now! I need to talk, but I don’t even know where to start.”\n\nHe paused, lost in thought.\n\n“Ugh, we’re so different,” he exclaimed. “We’re not the same. And why did I even come? I’ll never forgive myself for this.”\n\n“No, it was good that you came,” Sonia insisted. “It’s better for me to know, way better!”\n\nHe looked at her, filled with anguish.\n\n“What if that’s really it?” he said, as if he was finally figuring something out. “Yeah, that’s it! I wanted to be a Napoleon, and that’s why I killed her… Do you get it now?”\n\n“N-no,” Sonia whispered, shy and unsure. “Just keep talking; I’ll understand, I promise!” she kept urging him.\n\n“You’ll understand? Alright, we’ll see!” He paused, lost in thought again.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confesses to Sonia that his desire to become a great figure like Napoleon motivated his crime, revealing his inner turmoil and sense of guilt."
