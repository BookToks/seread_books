It was of his landlady’s daughter, the girl who had died of fever—she’d wanted to be a nun. For a moment, he stared at her delicate, expressive face, kissed the portrait, and handed it to Dounia.\n\n“I used to share so much with her, only with her,” he said, lost in thought. “I told her things that have turned into such a nightmare. But don’t worry,” he continued, looking at Dounia, “she didn’t support any of this, just like you. I’m actually glad she’s gone. What matters now is that everything is about to change, everything is going to break apart,” he said, suddenly sinking back into his gloom. “But am I ready for this? Do I even want it? They say I need to suffer! What’s the point of all this pointless suffering? Will I understand it better when I’m crushed by hardships and feel like an old man after twenty years in prison? What will I even have to live for then? Why am I agreeing to this life now? I knew I was pathetic when I stood staring at the Neva this morning!”\n\nFinally, they both stepped outside. It was tough for Dounia, but she loved him. She walked away, but after about fifty steps, she turned to look back at him. He was still there. At the corner, he turned too, and their eyes met one last time. But when he saw her looking, he waved her off impatiently and turned the corner abruptly.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist reflects on his past and the inevitability of suffering, questioning the purpose of his impending hardships."
