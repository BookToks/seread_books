  "text": "Amalia Ivanovna was acting all high and mighty, saying she invited those ladies who didn’t show up because they wouldn’t come to someone who isn’t a real lady. Katerina Ivanovna shot back that since Amalia was acting like a total mess, she had no right to judge who’s a lady. \n\nAmalia then bragged about her dad from Berlin, claiming he was super important. She jumped up, put her hands in her pockets, puffed her cheeks, and made silly “poof! poof!” sounds, trying to imitate him. The other lodgers were cracking up, egging her on for a showdown. 😂\n\nBut Katerina had enough. She called Amalia out, saying she probably didn’t even have a dad and was just a drunk from Petersburg who used to be a cook—maybe worse. Amalia turned bright red and screamed back that Katerina probably didn’t have a dad either, but hers was from Berlin and wore a long coat saying “poof-poof-poof!”\n\nKaterina smirked, pointing out that everyone knew her family’s history. Her dad was a colonel, and if Amalia really had a dad, he was probably just some Finnish milkman. But honestly, Katerina doubted she even had a father at all.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna and Amalia Ivanovna engage in a heated argument about their social status and family backgrounds, revealing deep-seated animosities."
