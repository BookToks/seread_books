  "text": "Raskolnikov felt the tension in the air as he approached a rundown building. The little flats in places like this always had those bells that rang in a weird way. He’d forgotten how that sound felt, but now it hit him hard, stirring up old memories. 🎶 His nerves were shot.\n\nSuddenly, the door cracked open just a bit. The old woman peered out, her eyes glinting suspiciously in the dim light. But when she noticed a few people on the landing, she got braver and swung the door wide open. Raskolnikov stepped into the dark entryway, which was separated from a tiny kitchen. \n\nThe old woman stood silently, studying him. She was small and shriveled, probably around sixty, with sharp eyes and a pointy nose. Her hair was a dull, grizzled mess, slicked back with oil, and she didn’t bother with a headscarf. Around her skinny neck, which looked like a chicken leg, was a ragged piece of flannel. Despite the heat, she wore an old, tattered fur cape that was yellow with age. She coughed and groaned constantly, which made Raskolnikov glance at her in a way that made her suspicious again.\n\n“Raskolnikov, a student. I was here about a month ago,” he quickly said, bowing slightly, trying to be polite. \n\n“I remember you, my good sir. I remember your visit quite well,” she replied clearly, still scrutinizing his face.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov visits an old woman, feeling increasingly anxious and mistrusted as he prepares for a significant encounter."
