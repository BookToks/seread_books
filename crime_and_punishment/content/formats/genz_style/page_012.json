  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nThe little flats in these houses have bells that ring like that. Raskolnikov had totally forgotten that bell's sound, but now it hit him hard, reminding him of something important. His nerves were shot by now. \n\nAfter a moment, the door opened just a crack. The old woman peeked out, clearly suspicious. All you could see were her little eyes shining in the dark. But when she noticed a few people in the hallway, she got braver and swung the door wide open. Raskolnikov stepped into the dim entryway, which was separated from a tiny kitchen. The old woman stood there, silent, studying him. \n\nShe was a small, hunched old lady, around sixty, with sharp, mean-looking eyes and a pointy nose. Her hair was colorless and greasy, with no kerchief to cover it. Around her skinny neck, which looked like a chicken leg, was a ragged flannel cloth. Despite the heat, she wore an old fur cape that was yellowed with age. She coughed and groaned all the time. Raskolnikov must have looked at her strangely, because suspicion flickered back into her eyes.\n\n“Raskolnikov, a student. I was here a month ago,” he quickly said, bowing a bit, trying to be polite. \n\n“I remember, my good sir. I remember your visit well,” the old woman replied clearly, still keeping her curious gaze on him.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov visits an old woman, feeling increasingly anxious and mistrusted as he prepares for his unsettling purpose."
