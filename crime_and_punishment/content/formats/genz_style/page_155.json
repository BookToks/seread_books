  "text": "He felt this strong urge to rush over to Nikodim Fomitch and spill everything that went down yesterday. Then, he’d take him to his place and show him the stuff hidden in the corner. The urge was so intense he almost jumped up to do it. But then a thought hit him: “Shouldn’t I pause for a sec?” Nah, better to just get rid of this weight without overthinking it. \n\nBut suddenly, he froze. Nikodim Fomitch was deep in conversation with Ilya Petrovitch, and he caught snippets of their talk. \n\n“It’s impossible, they’ll both get off. The whole story doesn’t add up. Why would they call the porter if they did it? To snitch on themselves? Or as a distraction? Too clever for that! Plus, Pestryakov, the student, was seen at the gate by both porters and a woman when he came in. He was with three friends who ditched him right at the gate, and he even asked the porters for directions while his friends were there. Would he ask for directions if he had bad intentions?” \n\n“And Koch? He was at the silversmith’s for half an hour before heading up to the old woman. He left at exactly a quarter to eight. Think about it…”\n\n“But wait, how do you explain this mess? They said they knocked and the door was locked, but three minutes later, when they went up with the porter, the door was wide open.”\n\n“That’s the point! The murderer must’ve been inside and locked the door. They would’ve caught him for sure if Koch hadn’t been such a fool looking for the porter.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Nikodim Fomitch discusses the contradictions in the case, suggesting that the accused will likely be released due to inconsistencies in the evidence."
