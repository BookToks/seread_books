At first, we were shocked; it all happened so suddenly. We talked it over all day.\n\nHe’s got money, two government jobs, and has made a name for himself. Sure, he’s 45, but he’s still got a decent look and might catch some eyes. He’s respectable, but he comes off a bit grumpy and full of himself. That might just be the first impression, though.\n\nBut hey, Rodya, when he arrives in Petersburg soon, don’t jump to conclusions about him. I know you can be quick to judge. I’m warning you because I think he’ll actually impress you. Remember, to really get to know someone, take your time. Avoid forming snap judgments; they’re hard to shake off later.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, Pyotr Petrovitch seems like a solid guy. When he visited, he called himself practical but also mentioned he shares a lot of beliefs with “our most rising generation” and is against outdated ideas. He talked a lot—maybe he likes the sound of his own voice—but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Honestly, I didn’t grasp everything he said, but he seemed interesting enough.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A well-to-do, somewhat conceited man named Pyotr Petrovitch has proposed marriage to Dounia, prompting discussions about his character and the importance of not forming hasty judgments."
