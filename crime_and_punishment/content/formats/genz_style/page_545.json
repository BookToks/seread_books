  "text": "In the tavern, someone told Katerina Ivanovna’s husband that she had performed the shawl dance for the governor and other important folks right after school. This fancy certificate was meant to show she could open a boarding school. But really, she just wanted to impress “those two stuck-up draggletails” if they showed up for dinner. She wanted to prove she came from a noble family—she was a colonel's daughter and way better than some recent attention-seeking women. \n\nThe certificate quickly made its way into the hands of the drunken guests, and Katerina didn’t bother to take it back. It stated clearly that her dad was a major and a member of an order, so she could almost claim to be a colonel's daughter. \n\nFeeling inspired, Katerina started talking about the peaceful, happy life they’d have in T——. She mentioned the gym teachers she’d hire for her boarding school, including a respectable old Frenchman, Mangot, who had taught her back in the day and still lived in T——. He’d probably teach at her school for a decent price. Then she brought up Sonia, who would join her in T—— and help with everything. Just then, someone at the far end of the table let out a loud laugh. \n\nKaterina tried to act like she didn’t hear it, but she raised her voice and jumped right back into her plans.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna boasts about her noble background and plans to open a boarding school, hoping to impress her guests."
