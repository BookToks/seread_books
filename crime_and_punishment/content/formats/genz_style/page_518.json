  "text": "‘Nah, it’s only the second time! But what if it were the fourth or even the fifteenth? That’s just silly! If I ever regretted my parents' deaths, it’s now. Sometimes I think, if they were alive, I would’ve thrown a huge protest in their faces! I would’ve done something wild… I would’ve shocked them! I really wish there was someone around!’ \n\n‘To surprise them! He-he! Anyway,’ Pyotr Petrovitch cut in, ‘do you know the dead guy’s daughter? That delicate little thing? What’s the deal with her?’ \n\n‘What about her? Honestly, I think that’s just how women are. Why not? Let’s be clear. In our current society, it’s not normal because it’s forced, but in the future, it’ll be totally fine because it’ll be a choice. Right now, she’s suffering, and that’s her strength—her asset, if you will. She has every right to use it. Sure, in the future, we won’t need those kinds of assets, but her role will mean something different—something that fits better with the world around her. As for Sofya Semyonovna, I see her actions as a bold protest against how society is set up, and I really respect her for that. I feel happy when I see her!’ \n\n‘I heard you got her kicked out of those lodgings.’ \n\nLebeziatnikov was furious. ‘That’s another lie!’ he shouted. ‘That’s not how it went down at all!’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The speaker expresses regret over the absence of his parents, reflecting on how he would have aimed to astonish them with a protest against societal norms, particularly regarding women's suffering and agency."
