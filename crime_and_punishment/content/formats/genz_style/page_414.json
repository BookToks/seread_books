  "text": "I came here without planning for it, but your face really caught my attention this morning.  \n“Where did you see me this morning?” Raskolnikov asked, feeling a bit on edge.  \n“I saw you by chance. I kept thinking there’s something about you that’s like me. But don’t worry, I’m not here to intrude. I used to get along just fine with card players, and I never bored Prince Svirbey, who’s a distant relative of mine. I could write about Raphael’s Madonna in Madam Prilukov’s album, and I stayed by Marfa Petrovna’s side for seven years. I even spent nights at Viazemsky’s place in the Hay Market back in the day. I might even go up in a balloon with Berg someday.”  \n“Oh, okay. Are you heading out on your travels soon?”  \n“What travels?”  \n“Your ‘journey’—you mentioned it yourself.”  \n“A journey? Right, I did mention that. But it’s a big topic… if only you knew what you’re asking,” he said, suddenly laughing loudly. “Maybe I’ll get married instead of going on that journey. They’re trying to set me up.”  \n“Here?”  \n“Yeah.”  \n“How did you find time for that?”  \n“I really want to see Avdotya Romanovna just once. I’m serious about it. Well, goodbye for now. Oh, I almost forgot! Tell your sister, Rodion Romanovitch, that Marfa Petrovna remembered her in her will.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov informs Raskolnikov that Marfa Petrovna left money for Avdotya Romanovna in her will."
