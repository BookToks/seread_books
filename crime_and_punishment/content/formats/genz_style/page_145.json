What money?” Raskolnikov thought. “But… then… it’s definitely not that.” Suddenly, he felt a wave of joy. It was like a huge weight lifted off his shoulders.\n\n“And what time were you told to show up, sir?” the assistant superintendent shouted, looking more annoyed by the second. “You were supposed to be here at nine, and it’s already twelve!”\n\n“The notice just got to me fifteen minutes ago,” Raskolnikov shot back, surprised by his own anger. He found a strange enjoyment in it. “And it’s enough that I came here feeling sick with fever.”\n\n“Please stop shouting!”\n\n“I’m not shouting; I’m speaking quietly. You’re the one yelling at me. I’m a student, and I won’t let anyone shout at me.”\n\nThe assistant superintendent was so mad he could barely speak. He jumped up from his chair. “Be quiet! You’re in a government office. Don’t be rude, sir!”\n\n“You’re in a government office too,” Raskolnikov retorted.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a mix of relief and anger during a confrontation in a government office regarding a notice he received."
