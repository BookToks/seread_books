Razumihin, standing in the doorway, dashed over, scooped Rodya up, and laid him on the sofa.\n\n“It’s fine, it’s fine!” he reassured Rodya's mom and sister. “Just a faint! The doctor said he’s doing way better—he’s good! Water! Look, he’s waking up, he’s all good now!” \n\nHe grabbed Dounia's arm (a bit too hard) and pulled her down to check on Rodya. Their mom and sister looked at him with relief and gratitude, seeing him as their savior. They had already heard from Nastasya about all the care Razumihin had given Rodya during his illness. Pulcheria, Rodya’s mom, had even called him “this very competent young man” in a chat with Dounia.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin rushes to help Rodya after he faints, reassuring his mother and sister that he is recovering."
