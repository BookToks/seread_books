Katerina Ivanovna picked up little Lida, lifted her from the chair, and knelt by the stove, making the kids kneel in front of her. \n\nLida was still shaking, but the boy, kneeling on his bare knees, crossed himself with a steady rhythm, bowing down and touching his forehead to the floor. You could tell it made him feel good. Katerina Ivanovna bit her lip, holding back tears. She prayed, adjusting the boy’s shirt and covering the girl’s bare shoulders with a kerchief she grabbed from the chest, all without standing up.\n\nMeanwhile, the door to the inner rooms opened again, and the crowd of onlookers from the staircase kept growing, but they didn’t step inside. A single candle flickered, lighting up the scene.\n\nJust then, Polenka pushed her way through the crowd at the door, panting from running. She took off her kerchief, searched for her mom, and said, “She’s coming; I saw her in the street.” Her mom made her kneel beside her.\n\nA young girl quietly made her way through the crowd. She looked out of place in that room filled with struggle, rags, death, and despair. She was in rags too, dressed in cheap clothes, but somehow adorned with flashy, worn-out accessories that stood out.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna and her children kneel in prayer amidst a scene of despair and impending death, while a crowd gathers outside."
