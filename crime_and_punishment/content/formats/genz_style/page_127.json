It’s clear—totally clear—that something’s off here!’ the young guy said, fired up, and dashed downstairs.  \n\nKoch hung back. He gave the doorbell a soft press, just one little ding, then started messing with the door handle, pulling it and letting it go to double-check that it was only hooked shut. Out of breath, he bent down to peek through the keyhole, but the key was stuck inside, so he couldn’t see anything.  \n\nRaskolnikov gripped the axe tightly. He felt like he was in a daze. He was even gearing up to fight when they came in. While they were knocking and chatting, he thought about just shouting at them through the door. Sometimes he wanted to yell at them, to mock them while they couldn’t get in! ‘Just hurry up!’ was the thought racing through his mind.  \n\n‘What’s taking so long? …’ Time dragged on—one minute, then another—still no one showed up. Koch started to get fidgety.  \n‘What’s going on?’ he exclaimed, suddenly abandoning his post and rushing down too.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, in a state of delirium and anxiety, prepares for a confrontation while hiding with an axe as others attempt to enter the locked room."
