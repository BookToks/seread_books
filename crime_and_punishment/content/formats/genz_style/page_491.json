  "text": "Did you seriously ring the bell and ask about blood? And why did you want the porters to come with you to the police station? If I even thought you were suspicious, I would’ve taken your statement properly, searched your place, maybe even arrested you. But I haven’t done any of that, so I’ve got no suspicion of you! You just can’t see it straight, and I’m saying it again.\n\nRaskolnikov flinched, and Porfiry noticed. \n\n“You’re lying!” Raskolnikov shouted. “I don’t know what your game is, but you’re definitely lying. You didn’t talk like that earlier, and I know I’m right!”\n\n“Me? Lying?” Porfiry shot back, feigning anger but keeping a smirk. He acted like Raskolnikov’s opinion didn’t bother him at all. “I’m lying… but how did I treat you just now? I was giving you all the chances to defend yourself—talking about your illness, delirium, and all that? Ha! But those psychological excuses aren’t super reliable. If you were sick or delusional, why were you haunted by those specific thoughts and not something else? There could’ve been a ton of other things, right? He-he-he!”\n\nRaskolnikov shot him a disdainful look. \n\n“Let’s cut to the chase,” he said, standing up decisively.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry asserts that he has no suspicion of Raskolnikov, despite Raskolnikov's anxious behavior and accusations of deceit."
