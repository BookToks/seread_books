Honestly, they can keep going without me,’ he continued, ignoring the question. ‘Who even wants to be a card shark?’  \n‘Wait, were you a card shark?’  \n‘What could I do? I was part of a crew of high-society guys eight years back. We had a blast. All classy folks—poets, wealthy guys. Funny thing is, in Russian society, the best manners often come from those who’ve been through tough times. Ever notice that? I’ve gone downhill since moving to the countryside. I even ended up in prison for debt, thanks to a shady Greek from Nezhin. Then Marfa Petrovna showed up; she haggled with him and bought my freedom for thirty thousand silver pieces (I owed seventy thousand). We got hitched, and she took me to the countryside like I was a prize. She was five years older than me and really cared for me. For seven years, I didn’t leave the country. And get this—she held a document over my head, the IOU for thirty thousand roubles. If I ever tried to act up, she’d have me trapped! And she totally would have done it! Women can be like that.’  \n‘If it wasn’t for that, would you have left her?’  \n‘Not sure. It wasn’t just the document keeping me in check. I didn’t want to go anywhere else. Marfa Petrovna even suggested I travel abroad since I was bored, but I’ve been abroad before, and it always made me feel sick. No idea why—maybe it was the sunrise, the Bay of Naples, or something.’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov reflects on his past experiences and relationships, revealing his complex feelings about society and personal freedom."
