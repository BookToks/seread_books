  "text": "The thought that felt like a dream just yesterday was now all too real, and it felt threatening in a way he hadnâ€™t expected. His head was pounding, and everything around him seemed dark. ðŸ˜µ\n\nHe looked around, searching for a place to sit. He was on Kâ€”â€” Boulevard and noticed a bench about a hundred steps ahead. He hurried toward it, but then something caught his eye. \n\nHe spotted a woman about twenty paces in front of him. At first, he ignored her, just like he often did with everything else on his way home. But there was something off about her that pulled him in. He felt an urge to figure out what was strange.\n\nShe looked young and was walking in the heat without a hat or even gloves, waving her arms around oddly. Her dress was made of some light, silky fabric, but it was all messed upâ€”like it wasnâ€™t fastened right and had a big tear near her waist. She had a little scarf around her neck, but it was askew.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov becomes increasingly aware of his surroundings and the strange behavior of a young woman he encounters while searching for a seat."
