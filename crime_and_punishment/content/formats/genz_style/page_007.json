  "text": "**Chapter I**\n\nOn a super hot evening in early July, a young guy stepped out of his tiny attic room in S. Place and hesitated as he walked toward K. bridge. \n\nHe had just dodged his landlady on the stairs. His room was basically a closet at the top of a five-story building. The landlady lived one floor down and, every time he left, he had to pass her kitchen, which was always wide open. Each time, he felt sick and ashamed. He was deep in debt to her and dreaded running into her. \n\nIt wasn’t that he was a coward—far from it. Lately, he’d been on edge, almost paranoid. He was so wrapped up in his own thoughts and so isolated that he didn’t want to see anyone, not even his landlady. He was weighed down by poverty, but the stress of it had started to fade. He’d stopped caring about practical stuff and lost all motivation. Nothing his landlady could do scared him anymore. But the thought of facing her? That was a whole different story.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A young man, burdened by debt and isolation, hesitates to leave his cramped garret due to his fear of encountering his landlady."
