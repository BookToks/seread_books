  "text": "That whole idea was Katerina Ivanovna’s doing—she just doesn’t get it! And I never had a romantic thing with Sofya Semyonovna! I was just trying to help her stand up for herself. All I wanted was for her to protest… and honestly, she couldn’t have stayed here anyway!\n\n“Have you asked her to join your group?” \n\nYou keep laughing, which is totally out of place, let me tell you. You don’t get it! There’s no specific role in a community. The whole point of a community is to break down those roles. What seems silly here makes sense there. What’s weird now can be totally normal in the right environment. It’s all about the context. People are shaped by their surroundings. \n\nAnd by the way, I’m still on good terms with Sofya Semyonovna, which shows she doesn’t think I did her wrong. I’m trying to bring her into the community, but in a different way. Why are you laughing? We’re building our own community, a special one that’s more inclusive. We’ve evolved in our beliefs. We reject more! And I’m still helping Sofya Semyonovna grow. She’s got an amazing character!\n\n“And you’re just using her good nature, huh? He-he!” \n\nNo, no! Not at all! \n\n“Oh really? That’s a strange thing to say!” \n\nTrust me! Why would I hide it? Honestly, I find it odd how shy and pure she is, especially in this day and age.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The speaker defends their relationship with Sofya Semyonovna as a disinterested effort to develop her character and attract her to a new community."
