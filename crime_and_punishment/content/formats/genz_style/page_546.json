  "text": "Katerina Ivanovna was all about Sonia, praising her skills and qualities—her kindness, patience, and good upbringing. She even gave Sonia a couple of warm kisses. Sonia turned red, and then Katerina suddenly started crying, saying she was just being emotional and it was time for tea since dinner was over.\n\nMeanwhile, Amalia Ivanovna felt left out of the convo and decided to jump in with a serious comment. She insisted that the new boarding school needed to focus on laundry and that there should be a good person to manage the linens. Plus, she thought the girls shouldn’t read novels at night.\n\nKaterina, clearly exhausted and over the whole dinner scene, quickly shut Amalia down. She said Amalia didn’t know what she was talking about and that laundry was the maid's job, not the director's. As for reading novels, that was just rude, and she asked Amalia to be quiet.\n\nAmalia got defensive, claiming she was just trying to help and reminded Katerina that she had paid her rent a while ago. Katerina shot back, saying it was a lie that Amalia cared about her.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna expresses her frustration with Amalia Ivanovna's meddling during a tense dinner, asserting her authority and dismissing irrelevant comments."
