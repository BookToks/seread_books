  "text": "Raskolnikov had to drop out of university, but it was just a temporary setback. He was hustling hard to save up so he could go back. He hadn’t seen Razumihin in four months, and Razumihin didn’t even know where he lived. A couple of months ago, they bumped into each other on the street, but Raskolnikov just turned away and crossed to the other side to avoid being seen.
