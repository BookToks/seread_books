  "text": "The bodies upstairs were still warm when they found them. If Nikolay or anyone else had just killed them and robbed the place, how do you explain their behavior? They were squealing, giggling, and messing around like kids right after the crime. They knew people would come in right away, yet they left the flat wide open and tossed their loot aside. There are plenty of witnesses who can back this up!\n\nSure, it sounds weird. It seems impossible, but listen. If finding the ear-rings in Nikolay’s hands at the exact time of the murder is a big deal against him—despite his explanation making sense—then we have to look at the facts that prove he’s innocent. These facts can’t be denied. \n\nBut do you really think our legal system will just accept this? No way! They found the jewel-case, and Nikolay tried to hang himself, which makes it look like he felt guilty. That’s the real kicker, and it’s what gets me fired up!\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The discussion revolves around the circumstantial evidence against Nikolay, questioning the psychological plausibility of his guilt despite the presence of incriminating items."
