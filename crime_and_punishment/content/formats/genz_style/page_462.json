  "text": "Sonia whispered, “What for? You don’t believe?” Her voice was soft, almost breathless.  \n“Read! I want you to,” Raskolnikov pushed. “You used to read to Lizaveta.”  \nSonia opened the book, her hands shaking. She tried to start but couldn’t get the words out.  \n“Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany…” she finally forced herself to read. But by the third word, her voice cracked like a strained string, and she caught her breath.  \n\nRaskolnikov realized why Sonia struggled to read. The more he saw it, the more he insisted. He knew how hard it was for her to reveal her feelings. Those feelings were like her secret treasure, kept hidden for years. She had lived with an unhappy father and a stepmother lost in grief, surrounded by starving kids and harsh words.  \n\nStill, he could see her desire to read, to share it with him, no matter how painful. He noticed it in her eyes, in her intense emotions. She took a deep breath, controlled the tightness in her throat, and continued reading the eleventh chapter of St. John. She pushed on to the nineteenth verse.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia struggles to read aloud to Raskolnikov, revealing her deep emotional turmoil and desire to share her thoughts despite the pain it brings her."
