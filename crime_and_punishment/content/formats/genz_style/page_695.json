Get it ready; I’ll wait.” \n\nHe stood there, just a couple of steps away, staring at her with intense determination. Dounia realized he’d rather die than let her leave. “And of course, she could take him out from this distance!” But then, she suddenly tossed the revolver aside. \n\n“She dropped it!” Svidrigaïlov exclaimed, surprised. He let out a deep breath, feeling a weight lift off his chest. It wasn’t just the fear of dying; it was a release from something darker and harder to name. \n\nHe stepped toward Dounia and gently wrapped his arm around her waist. She didn’t push him away but trembled like a leaf, looking at him with pleading eyes. He tried to speak, but no words came out. \n\n“Let me go,” Dounia begged. Svidrigaïlov shivered. Her voice sounded different now. \n\n“So, you don’t love me?” he asked softly. Dounia shook her head. \n\n“And… you can’t? Never?” he whispered, filled with despair. \n\n“Never!” \n\nA heavy silence fell between them as Svidrigaïlov struggled internally. He gazed at her, a mix of emotions in his eyes. Suddenly, he pulled his arm away, turned to the window, and faced it. After a moment, he said, “Here’s the key.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia, confronted by Svidrigaïlov, ultimately rejects his advances and drops the revolver, leading to a moment of emotional turmoil for both characters."
