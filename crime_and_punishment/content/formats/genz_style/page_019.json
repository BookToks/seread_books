  "text": "**Chapter II**\n\nRaskolnikov wasnâ€™t a crowd person. He usually avoided people, especially lately. But suddenly, he craved company. Something was shifting inside him, sparking a thirst for connection. After a month of feeling miserable and anxious, he just wanted a break, even if it meant hanging out in a grimy tavern. \n\nThe tavern owner was in another room but popped down the steps often, his flashy, tarred boots with red cuffs leading the way. He wore a long coat and a greasy black satin waistcoat, no tie in sight, and his face looked like it was coated in oil. At the counter, a 14-year-old boy stood, with a younger kid nearby grabbing whatever was needed. The counter was piled with sliced cucumbers, dried black bread, and some poorly chopped fish, all giving off a terrible smell. The air was thick and heavy with booze; just five minutes in there could easily get someone tipsy. \n\nSometimes, you run into strangers who catch your interest...\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, weary from isolation, feels a sudden desire for company despite the unpleasantness of his surroundings in a tavern."
