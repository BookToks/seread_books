  "text": "Raskolnikov wasn’t really into crowds. He usually kept to himself, especially lately. But suddenly, he felt this urge to be around people. Something was shifting inside him, and he craved company. After a month of feeling miserable and anxious, he just wanted a break, even if it was in a messy place. So, despite the dirty vibes, he was actually happy to chill in the tavern.\n\nThe tavern owner was in another room but popped down the stairs now and then. You could see his flashy, tarred boots with red tops before anything else. He wore a full coat and a super greasy black satin waistcoat, no tie, and his face looked like it was covered in oil. At the bar, there was a 14-year-old boy, and another younger kid was running around getting stuff. On the counter, there were some sliced cucumbers, dry black bread, and chopped fish, all giving off a terrible smell. It was suffocating in there, with the strong smell of alcohol—five minutes in that air could get anyone tipsy. \n\nSometimes, you meet strangers that spark your interest.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, weary from isolation, feels a sudden desire for company despite the unpleasantness of his surroundings."
