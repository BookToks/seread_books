Like that worker of yours said when he was tussling with Dmitri about the old lady…”\n\n“How do you know about that?” Zametov asked, surprised.\n\n“Maybe I know more than you think.”\n\n“You’re acting weird. You shouldn’t be out.”\n\n“Do I seem strange?” Raskolnikov replied.\n\n“Yes. Why are you reading the papers?”\n\n“Yeah, I am.”\n\n“Is it about the fires?”\n\n“Nope, not reading about those.” He shot Zametov a sly look, smirking. “But admit it, you’re dying to know what I’m really reading about.”\n\n“I’m not. Can I just ask why you keep…?”\n\n“Listen, you’re a cultured guy, right?”\n\n“I was in the sixth class at the gymnasium,” Zametov said, trying to sound important.\n\n“Sixth class! Oh, my little bird! With your fancy hair and rings—you’re a real gentleman. Ugh, what a charming kid!” Raskolnikov burst out laughing, catching Zametov off guard. Zametov stepped back, more confused than offended.\n\n“Wow, you’re really something!” Zametov said, still taken aback.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov engages in a cryptic conversation with Zametov, hinting at deeper thoughts while appearing unwell and strange."
