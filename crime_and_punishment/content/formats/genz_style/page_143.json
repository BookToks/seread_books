  "text": "The chief clerk was busy writing down something for another person. Next to him was a really stout woman with a blotchy, purplish-red face. She was dressed to the nines, sporting a brooch the size of a saucer, and seemed to be waiting for something. Raskolnikov handed his notice to the head clerk. The clerk glanced at it, said, “Wait a minute,” and continued helping the woman in mourning.\n\nRaskolnikov felt a bit of relief. “It can’t be that!” he thought. Gradually, he started to regain his confidence, telling himself to stay calm and brave.\n\n“Just some silly mistake, and I might slip up! Ugh… it’s so stuffy in here,” he added, “makes my head spin… and my thoughts too…”\n\nHe felt a storm brewing inside him. He was scared of losing control. He tried to focus on something random to distract himself, but nothing worked. Still, he was curious about the head clerk. He hoped to read something from his face.\n\nThe clerk was young, around twenty-two, with a dark, expressive face that looked older. He was dressed sharply, hair parted perfectly, and wore rings on his clean fingers and a gold chain on his waistcoat. He even spoke a little French to a foreigner in the room, and he did it pretty well.\n\n“Luise Ivanovna, you can sit down,” he said casually to the brightly dressed, purple-faced lady who was still standing.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences inner turmoil and anxiety while waiting in a stifling office filled with various people."
