Katia showed up and belted out another sad song about how a \"villain and tyrant\" started kissing her. \n\nSvidriga√Ølov treated Katia, the organ-grinder, some singers, the waiters, and two little clerks. He was especially drawn to the clerks because they both had crooked noses‚Äîone bent left and the other right. They finally took him to a pleasure garden, where he paid for their entry. \n\nThe garden had one scraggly three-year-old pine tree and three bushes, plus a \"Vauxhall,\" which was really just a drinking bar that also served tea. There were a few green tables and chairs scattered around. A group of miserable singers and a drunk but super sad German clown from Munich with a red nose entertained the crowd. \n\nThe clerks got into a spat with some other clerks, and it looked like a fight was about to break out. Svidriga√Ølov was picked to settle the argument. He listened for about fifteen minutes, but they were shouting so loud it was impossible to make sense of anything. The only clear thing was that one of them had stolen something and even sold it right there to a Jew but refused to share the loot with his buddy.
