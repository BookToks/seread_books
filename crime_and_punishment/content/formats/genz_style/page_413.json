  "text": "Luzhin is just another guy giving her money, just from a different source. Chill out, Rodion Romanovitch, think it through. \n\nSvidrigaïlov was super calm while saying this. \n\n“Please stop,” Raskolnikov replied. “This is completely out of line.” \n\n“Not at all. So, a guy can only hurt others and can’t do even a little good because of some silly rules? That’s ridiculous. If I kicked the bucket and left your sister ten grand in my will, you really think she’d turn it down?” \n\n“Yeah, she probably would.” \n\n“Not a chance. But if you don’t want it, fine. Ten thousand roubles can really come in handy. Just please tell Avdotya Romanovna what I said.” \n\n“Nope, not happening.” \n\n“Then I’ll have to go see her myself and bug her.” \n\n“And if I do tell her, will you leave her alone?” \n\n“I honestly don’t know. I’d love to see her again.” \n\n“Don’t count on it.” \n\n“Sorry about that. But you don’t really know me. We could end up being friends.” \n\n“You think we could be friends?” \n\n“Why not?” Svidrigaïlov said with a smile. He got up and grabbed his hat. “I didn’t mean to interrupt you.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov suggests that Raskolnikov should inform his sister about a monetary gift he wishes to offer her, despite Raskolnikov's refusal to facilitate the communication."
