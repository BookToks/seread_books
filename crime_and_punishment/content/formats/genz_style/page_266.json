Why should they pay me? He was drunk and jumped in front of the horses! What income? He brought us nothing but pain. He drank away everything! He stole from us for booze, ruining our lives! Thank God he’s dying—one less burden!” \n\n“You have to forgive at the hour of death, madam. Holding onto anger is a sin,” the priest replied gently.\n\nKaterina was focused on the dying man, giving him water, wiping away blood and sweat, and adjusting his pillow. She turned to the priest, nearly frantic. “Ah, Father! That’s just talk! Forgive? If he hadn’t been hit, he would’ve come home drunk today, in a dirty, ragged shirt, and I’d be up all night washing his clothes and the kids’ too, then darning them in the morning. That’s how I spend my nights! What’s the point of talking about forgiveness? I’ve already forgiven him!” \n\nA harsh cough cut her off. She pressed her handkerchief to her lips, revealing blood, while clutching her chest in pain.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna expresses her anger and frustration over her husband's alcoholism and the burden it has placed on her life, dismissing the idea of forgiveness in his dying moments."
