It started with some rumors. I won’t bore you with how they reached me or how they affected you. My suspicions were triggered by a random event—one that could’ve easily not happened. What was it?

I’ll admit it openly—”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry Petrovitch expresses his desire to clarify misunderstandings with Raskolnikov and acknowledges the suffering caused by their interactions."
