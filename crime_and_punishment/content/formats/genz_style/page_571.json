She’ll come looking for you since she’s out of options,” he said, a bit annoyed. “If she can’t find you here, you’ll get the blame…” \n\nSonia sat down, tense and worried. Raskolnikov was quiet, staring at the floor, deep in thought. \n\n“This time, Luzhin didn’t want to go after you,” he started, still avoiding her gaze. “But if he had wanted to, if it fit his plans, he would’ve sent you to prison. Thank Lebeziatnikov and me for that. Right?” \n\n“Yeah,” she replied softly. “Yes,” she said again, lost in her worries. \n\n“But I might not have been there. It was pure luck that Lebeziatnikov showed up.” \n\nSonia stayed quiet. \n\n“And if you had gone to prison, what then? Do you remember what I said yesterday?” \n\nShe didn’t respond. He waited. \n\n“I thought you’d shout again, ‘don’t talk about it, stop.’” Raskolnikov chuckled, but it felt forced. “What, more silence?” he asked after a minute. “We need to talk about something. I’m curious how you’d handle a certain ‘problem,’ as Lebeziatnikov would say.” (He was starting to lose focus.) “Seriously, imagine if you knew all of Luzhin’s plans ahead of time. Knew for sure they’d ruin Katerina…”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov and Sonia discuss the potential consequences of Luzhin's actions on Katerina Ivanovna's life."
