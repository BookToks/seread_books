He kept pacing the room, not even glancing at her. Finally, he approached her, eyes shining like crazy. He grabbed her shoulders and locked eyes with her tear-streaked face. His gaze was intense, almost feverish, and his lips trembled. Then, out of nowhere, he dropped to the floor and kissed her foot. Sonia recoiled, like she was facing a lunatic. Honestly, he did look unhinged.\n\n\"What are you doing to me?\" she whispered, going pale as a wave of panic hit her.\n\nHe stood up immediately. \"I wasn't bowing to you; I was bowing to all the suffering in the world,\" he said, almost frantically, and turned to the window. \"Listen,\" he added after a moment. \"I just told some arrogant guy he wasn’t worth your little finger… and that I honored my sister by sitting next to you.\"\n\n\"You said that to them? In front of her?\" Sonia gasped, terrified. \"Sit with me? An honor? I’m… dishonorable. Why would you say that?\"\n\n\"I didn’t say it because of your dishonor or your sins. I said it because of your immense suffering. But yeah, you’re a big sinner,\" he replied, almost seriously. \"Your worst sin? You’ve destroyed yourself for nothing. Isn't that terrifying? You’re stuck in this grime that you hate, and you know it deep down (just open your eyes).\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses his anguish over Sonia's suffering and self-betrayal, highlighting the contrast between her dishonor and the dignity of her suffering."
