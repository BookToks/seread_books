Let me make this clear: I don’t value myself as highly as you think. I’m here to tell you that if you keep messing with my sister and think you can benefit from what’s happened recently, I will kill you before you can even get me locked up. Count on it. I can follow through. And if you have something to say—because I’ve been feeling like you do—just spit it out. Time’s ticking, and it might be too late soon.” \n\n“Why the rush?” Svidrigaïlov asked, raising an eyebrow. \n\n“Everyone has their plans,” Raskolnikov replied, dark and impatient. \n\n“You asked me to be open, but now you won’t answer my question,” Svidrigaïlov noted with a smirk. “You think I have my own agenda, so you’re suspicious of me. That makes sense given your situation. But even though I’d like to be on good terms, I’m not going to bend over backward to prove it.
