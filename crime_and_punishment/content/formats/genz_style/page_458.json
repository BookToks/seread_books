  "text": "Of course, Raskolnikov knew Sonia’s situation was rare but sadly not one-of-a-kind. Still, you’d think her background and education would’ve kept her from that gross path. What was keeping her going—certainly not depravity? All that shame had barely touched her; it hadn’t seeped into her heart. He could see right through her.\n\n“There are three paths for her,” he thought: the canal (a grim end), the madhouse, or falling into a darkness that hardens the heart. The last option was the worst, but he was young and cynical, so he couldn’t shake the belief that it was the most likely outcome.\n\n“But can that be true?” he questioned himself. “Can someone who still has a pure spirit really get dragged into that pit of filth? Has it already started? Is she just able to cope because vice is becoming less disgusting to her? No, no, that can’t be!” he exclaimed, echoing Sonia’s earlier thoughts. “What has kept her from the canal is the idea of sin and those kids… And if she hasn’t lost her mind… but who’s to say she hasn’t? Is she even sane? Can someone reason like she does? How can she sit on the edge of this awful abyss and ignore the warnings? Does she think a miracle will save her? No doubt she does. Doesn’t that all sound a bit crazy? 🤔\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov contemplates Sonia's exceptional resilience amidst her degrading circumstances, questioning whether her purity can withstand the moral decay surrounding her."
