Keep going!” he told the onlookers pressing in.  \n“She’s dying!” someone yelled.  \n“She’s lost it,” another person said.  \n“Lord, help us,” a woman murmured, crossing herself. “Have they caught the kids? They’re bringing them back; the older one’s got them… those little troublemakers!”  \n\nWhen they checked Katerina Ivanovna closely, they realized she hadn’t hurt herself on a stone, as Sonia thought. The blood soaking the pavement was coming from her chest.  \n\n“I’ve seen this before,” the official said to Raskolnikov and Lebeziatnikov. “That’s consumption. The blood flows and chokes the patient. I saw it with a family member not long ago… almost a pint of blood, all at once. What can we do? She’s dying.”  \n\n“This way, this way!

Oh no!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna collapses and bleeds, prompting a frantic response from those around her as they realize she is gravely ill."
