It’s a real thrill!”  \n“Look who’s talking,” Svidrigaïlov replied, eyeing Raskolnikov with surprise. “You’re a cynic yourself. You’ve got plenty of reasons to be. You get a lot and can do a lot too. But enough of this. I wish we had chatted more. I won’t lose track of you… just wait.”  \nSvidrigaïlov exited the restaurant, and Raskolnikov followed him. Svidrigaïlov wasn’t really that drunk; the wine buzz was fading fast. He seemed deep in thought, frowning and looking uneasy, like something important was on his mind. His attitude toward Raskolnikov had shifted too—he was getting ruder and more mocking. Raskolnikov picked up on this and felt uneasy himself. He started to suspect Svidrigaïlov and decided to tail him.  \nThey stepped out onto the street.  \n“You go right, I’ll go left, or whatever. Just know, adieu, mon plaisir—hope we meet again.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov becomes suspicious of Svidrigaïlov's intentions after their conversation in the restaurant."
