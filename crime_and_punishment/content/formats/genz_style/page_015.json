There was nowhere else to go, and he had another reason for being there. \n\n“Hand it over,” he said, a bit harshly. \n\nThe old woman fumbled for her keys and disappeared behind the curtain into another room. He stood there, listening. He could hear her unlocking the chest of drawers. \n\n“It must be the top drawer,” he thought. “She keeps the keys in her right pocket, all on a steel ring. And there’s one key that’s way bigger than the rest, with deep notches. That can’t be for the chest of drawers… so there’s probably some other box or strongbox. That’s good to know. Strongboxes always have keys like that… but this feels so degrading.” \n\nThe old woman returned. \n\n“Here you go, sir. We say ten copecks per rouble a month, so I need fifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance. For the two roubles I lent you before, you owe me twenty copecks on the same terms. That makes thirty-five copecks in total. So I’ll give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the watch. Here it is.” \n\n“What? Just a rouble and fifteen copecks?” \n\n“Yep.” \n\nHe didn’t argue and took the money. He looked at the old woman, lingering a bit, like he still had something to say.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The young man reluctantly pawns his watch to the old woman, contemplating her possessions and the degrading nature of the transaction."
