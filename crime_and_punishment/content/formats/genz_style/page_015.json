  "text": "Raskolnikov was about to leave but stopped. He realized he had nowhere else to go and another reason for being there. \n\n“Hand it over,” he said, sounding rough. \n\nThe old woman started digging in her pocket for keys and slipped behind the curtain into another room. Raskolnikov stood there, curious. He could hear her unlocking the chest of drawers. \n\n“It must be the top drawer,” he thought. “She keeps the keys in her right pocket, all on a steel ring. But wait, there’s one key way bigger than the rest, with deep notches. That can’t be for the chest… there must be another strong-box. That’s good to know. Strong-boxes always have keys like that. But man, this feels degrading.” \n\nThe old woman came back. \n\n“Here, sir: since we say ten copecks for a rouble a month, I need fifteen copecks from a rouble and a half in advance. For the two roubles I lent you before, you owe me twenty copecks in advance. That’s thirty-five copecks total. So, I’ll give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the watch. Here it is.” \n\n“What! Only a rouble and fifteen copecks?” \n\n“Yup.” \n\nHe didn’t argue and took the money. He looked at the old woman, not in a rush to leave, like he still had something to say.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The young man reluctantly pawns a watch to the old woman, contemplating her keys and the potential secrets they hold."
