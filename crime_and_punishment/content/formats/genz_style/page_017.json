  "text": "Raskolnikov snapped back to reality as he found himself on the next street. He looked around and noticed a tavern with steps leading down to the basement. Just then, two drunk guys stumbled out, arguing and leaning on each other as they climbed the steps. Without thinking, Raskolnikov headed down. He had never been to a tavern before, but now he felt dizzy and super thirsty. He craved a cold beer and figured his weakness was due to not eating.\n\nHe plopped down at a sticky table in a dark corner, ordered a beer, and chugged the first glass. Instantly, he felt better, and his thoughts started to clear up. “This is all nonsense,” he thought, feeling a bit hopeful. “It’s just physical stress. A beer and some dry bread, and boom—my brain’s sharper, my mind’s clear, and my will is strong! Phew, this is so trivial!” \n\nDespite his dismissive thoughts, he felt lighter, like a weight had been lifted. He glanced around at the other people in the tavern with a friendly vibe. But deep down, he sensed that this sudden cheerfulness wasn’t quite right. \n\nThe tavern was mostly empty. Besides the two drunk guys he saw earlier, a group of five men and a girl with a concertina had just left, making the place quiet and a bit lonely.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, feeling giddy and tormented by thirst, enters a tavern for the first time, seeking relief in beer to clear his mind."
