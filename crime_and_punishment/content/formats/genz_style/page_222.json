  "text": "I knew you weren't feeling me, but I stuck around to figure things out. I can overlook a lot when someone’s sick and connected to me, but you? Never again. \n\n“I’m not sick,” Raskolnikov shot back. \n\n“That’s even worse…” \n\n“Go to hell!” \n\nLuzhin didn’t stick around to finish his thought. He squeezed between the table and chair, and Razumihin stood up to let him pass. Without a word to anyone—not even a nod to Zossimov, who’d been signaling to back off—Luzhin left, lifting his hat to avoid crushing it as he ducked out. The way he walked showed just how insulted he was. \n\n“How could you do that?” Razumihin asked, shaking his head in confusion. \n\n“Leave me alone! All of you!” Raskolnikov yelled, frantic. “Will you stop tormenting me? I’m not scared of you! Not scared of anyone! Just get away! I want to be alone!” \n\n“Let’s go,” Zossimov said, nodding to Razumihin. \n\n“But we can’t just leave him like this!” \n\n“Come on,” Zossimov insisted, and he headed out. Razumihin paused for a second, then rushed after him. \n\n“It might be worse not to listen to him,” Zossimov said on the stairs. “We shouldn’t push him.” \n\n“What’s going on with him?” \n\n“If only he could have a good shock, that’s what he needs.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses his intense frustration and desire for solitude amidst the tension with Luzhin and concern from his friends."
