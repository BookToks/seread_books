I’ll get you to see the whole truth soon enough because I genuinely care about you and want the best for you.”\n\nRaskolnikov’s lips quivered.\n\n“Yeah, I do,” Porfiry continued, giving Raskolnikov’s arm a friendly nudge. “You need to take care of yourself. Your mom and sister are here now; think about them. You’re just scaring them instead of comforting them…”\n\n“What’s it to you? How do you know that? Why do you care? Are you spying on me?” \n\n“Goodness! I learned it all from you! You don’t realize that in your nervousness, you spill everything to me and others. I even got some juicy details from Razumihin yesterday. But listen, your cleverness and paranoia are clouding your judgment. \n\nLet’s talk about the bell-ringing. I, as an investigating lawyer, revealed a key fact, and you don’t see its importance! If I had any real suspicion about you, I wouldn’t have acted like this. I would’ve kept you in the dark, distracted you, and then hit you with a surprise question: ‘What were you doing at the murdered woman’s place around ten or eleven?’”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry suggests that Raskolnikov's suspicious behavior reveals his guilt, while expressing concern for his health and family."
