Her eyes landed on Pyotr Petrovitch’s gold eyeglass in his left hand and the flashy ring with a yellow stone on his middle finger. But then, not knowing where else to look, she ended up staring right at him again. After a moment of even more seriousness, he spoke.\n\n“I happened to chat with Katerina Ivanovna yesterday. Poor woman. That was enough for me to see she’s in a—let’s say, unusual—situation.”\n\n“Yeah… unusual…” Sonia quickly agreed.\n\n“Or it’s easier to say she’s sick.”\n\n“Yeah, easier to say… sick.”\n\n“Exactly. So, out of kindness and compassion, I want to help her, given her tough spot. I believe this whole struggling family is now relying on you, right?”\n\n“Can I ask,” Sonia stood up, “did you mention anything to her about a pension? She told me you said you’d help her get one. Is that true?”\n\n“Not at all, and honestly, that’s ridiculous! I only suggested she might get some temporary help as the widow of an official who died in service—if she qualifies.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia feels embarrassed while discussing Katerina Ivanovna's dire situation and the possibility of assistance with Pyotr Petrovitch."
