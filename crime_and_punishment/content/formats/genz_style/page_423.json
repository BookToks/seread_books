When I was there, he treated the servants well, and they actually liked him, even if they blamed him for Philip’s death.”\n\n“Seems like you’re suddenly defending him, Avdotya Romanovna,” Luzhin said, smirking. “No doubt he’s clever and knows how to charm women, like Marfa Petrovna, who died under strange circumstances. I just want to help you and your mom with my advice, especially since Svidrigaïlov will probably come back with more schemes. Honestly, I think he’ll end up in debtor’s prison again.
