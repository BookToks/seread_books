  "text": "The girl was swaying as she walked, stumbling side to side. Raskolnikov couldn’t take his eyes off her. When he caught up, she collapsed onto a seat, her head lolling back as she closed her eyes, clearly exhausted. A closer look revealed she was totally drunk. It was shocking. Hard to believe he wasn’t mistaken. \n\nShe looked young—maybe sixteen, possibly even fifteen. She had a cute face, but it was flushed and puffy. She seemed barely aware of her surroundings, crossing her legs in a way that showed she had no clue she was out in public.\n\nRaskolnikov didn’t sit down. He felt he should stay, but he was confused about what to do. This boulevard was usually quiet, and at two o’clock in the heat, it was totally empty. But across the street, about fifteen paces away, a guy stood on the edge of the pavement. He looked like he wanted to approach the girl too. He had probably spotted her from afar and followed her, but now Raskolnikov was in his way. The man shot Raskolnikov an angry look while trying to ignore him, waiting impatiently for the ragged guy to move on. His intentions were clear. The guy was plump, well-dressed, around thirty, and had a ruddy complexion.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov encounters a young, drunk girl on a deserted boulevard and feels compelled to protect her from a lurking gentleman with questionable intentions."
