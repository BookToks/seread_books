  "text": "Raskolnikov's in a rough spot. Porfiry Petrovitch, worried about him, rushes to get some water. “Drink this, it’ll help!” he says, showing real concern. Raskolnikov just stares, curious but not taking the glass.\n\n“Rodion Romanovitch, you’re losing it! Seriously, drink some water!” Porfiry insists, pushing the glass into his hands. Raskolnikov lifts it but then puts it back down, disgusted.\n\n“You’ve had a little episode! You’re gonna make yourself sick again,” Porfiry says, still friendly but looking a bit uneasy. “You need to take better care of yourself! Dmitri Prokofitch was here yesterday after you visited. I know I can be a bit sarcastic, but he just wouldn’t stop talking! Did he come from you? Please, sit down!”\n\n“No, he didn’t come from me, but I knew he was going to see you,” Raskolnikov replies sharply.\n\n“You knew?” Porfiry asks, surprised.\n\n“I knew. What’s it to you?” Raskolnikov snaps back.\n\n“Well, Rodion Romanovitch, I know a lot more about you than just that. I know everything.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry expresses concern for Raskolnikov's health while revealing his awareness of Raskolnikov's situation and the suspicions surrounding him."
