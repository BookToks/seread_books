  "text": "Raskolnikov couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “You, Rodion Romanovitch! You’re the murderer,” Porfiry said, almost whispering but totally serious. \n\nRaskolnikov jumped up from the sofa, stood there for a moment, then sat back down without saying a word. His face was twitching. \n\n“Your lip is twitching just like before,” Porfiry noted, sounding almost sympathetic. “I think you’ve misunderstood me, Rodion Romanovitch. That’s why you’re so shocked. I came to lay it all out and be straight with you.” \n\n“It wasn’t me who killed her,” Raskolnikov whispered, sounding like a scared kid caught red-handed. \n\n“No, it was you, Rodion Romanovitch, and no one else,” Porfiry said firmly, with real conviction. \n\nThey fell silent, and it stretched on for a weirdly long ten minutes. Raskolnikov rested his elbow on the table and ran his fingers through his hair. Porfiry just sat there, waiting. Suddenly, Raskolnikov shot Porfiry a scornful look. \n\n“You’re using your old tricks again, Porfiry Petrovitch! Same method! Don’t you ever get tired of it?” \n\n“Oh, come on, what does that matter now? It’d be different if there were witnesses, but we’re just whispering here. You can see I’m not here to hunt you down like a rabbit. Whether you confess or not doesn’t change anything for me. I’m already convinced.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry Petrovtich confronts Raskolnikov with the conviction that he is the murderer, leading to a tense and silent exchange between them."
