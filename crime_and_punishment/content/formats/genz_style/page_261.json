  "text": "\"I told you before, you can’t call me Amalia Ludwigovna. It’s Amalia Ivanovna.\" \n\n\"Sorry, but you’re Amalia Ludwigovna to me. I’m not one of your sycophants like Mr. Lebeziatnikov, who’s probably laughing behind that door right now (I can actually hear him). I don’t get why you hate that name so much. Look at Semyon Zaharovitch—he's dying. Please close that door and keep everyone out. Let him die in peace! If not, I’ll have to tell the Governor-General about how you’re acting. He knew me as a kid and remembers Semyon well. He’s helped him before. \n\nEveryone knows Semyon had friends who cared about him, but he pushed them away because of his pride. Now (she pointed at Raskolnikov), this generous young man is here to help. He’s wealthy and has connections, and he’s known Semyon since childhood. Trust me, Amalia Ludwigovna...\"\n\nKaterina Ivanovna spoke super fast, but then she coughed and her words stopped. In that moment, the dying man stirred and groaned; she rushed to his side. He opened his eyes, confused, and looked at Raskolnikov, who was leaning over him. He struggled to breathe, blood trickling from the corners of his mouth, and sweat beaded on his forehead.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna insists on the importance of dignity for the dying Semyon Zaharovitch, urging Amalia Ludwigovna to allow him peace in his final moments."
