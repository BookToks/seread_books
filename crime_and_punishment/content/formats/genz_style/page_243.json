Potchinkov’s house, 47, Babushkin’s flat…’  \n‘I’m not coming, Razumihin.’ Raskolnikov turned and walked off.  \n‘Oh, you will!’ Razumihin called after him. ‘I won’t even know you if you don’t! By the way, is Zametov in there?’  \n‘Yep.’  \n‘Did you see him?’  \n‘Yep.’  \n‘Talk to him?’  \n‘Yep.’  \n‘About what? Ugh, don’t tell me! Remember Potchinkov’s house, 47, Babushkin’s flat!’  \nRaskolnikov kept walking and turned onto Sadovy Street. Razumihin watched him, deep in thought. Then he waved and went inside but paused before heading up the stairs.  \n‘Ugh, he made sense, but still… I’m such an idiot! As if crazy people don’t make sense sometimes! This is exactly what Zossimov was worried about.’ He tapped his forehead. ‘What if… I can’t let him go off alone? He might do something reckless… What a mistake! I have to go after him.’ He dashed back to catch up with Raskolnikov, but he was already gone. Cursing under his breath, he hurried back to the Palais de Cristal to find Zametov.  \nMeanwhile, Raskolnikov headed straight to X—— Bridge, standing there lost in thought.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's interactions with Razumihin reveal his troubled state and the concern of his friend for his well-being."
