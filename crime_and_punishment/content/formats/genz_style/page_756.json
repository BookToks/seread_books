  "text": "He was sick for a long time. But it wasn’t the nightmare of prison life—the tough work, bad food, shaved head, or worn-out clothes—that broke him. He didn’t care about those struggles. In fact, he welcomed the hard labor. When he was physically drained, at least he could count on a few hours of solid sleep. And what was the food to him? Thin cabbage soup with bugs floating in it? He’d often gone without even that when he was a student. His clothes were warm and fit his life. He didn’t even notice the chains. \n\nWas he embarrassed by his shaved head and mismatched coat? Who would he be ashamed in front of? Sonia? She was scared of him; how could he feel shame in front of her? Still, he felt embarrassed even with Sonia, whom he treated poorly because of it. But it wasn’t just his appearance he was ashamed of—it was his wounded pride. That’s what made him sick. \n\nHe would have felt so much better if he could just blame himself. He could have handled anything then, even shame. But he was hard on himself, and his conscience didn’t find anything truly awful in his past—just a simple mistake that could happen to anyone. He was ashamed simply because he, Raskolnikov, had stumbled so badly due to some random twist of fate and had to face the consequences.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's illness stems not from the hardships of prison life, but from his wounded pride and inability to accept his fate."
