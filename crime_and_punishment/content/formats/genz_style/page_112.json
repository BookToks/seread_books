He listened again on the staircase, really focused this time… then glanced around one last time, gathered himself, and checked the axe in the noose. “Am I super pale?” he wondered. “Am I obviously on edge? She’s gonna be suspicious… Should I wait a bit longer until my heart stops racing?”\n\nBut his heart didn’t calm down. It thumped harder, like it was mocking him. He couldn’t take it anymore, so he reached for the bell and rang it. Half a minute later, he rang again, louder this time.\n\nNo answer. Ringing again would just be awkward. The old woman was definitely home, but she was alone and suspicious. He knew her habits… so he pressed his ear to the door again. Either his senses were on high alert (which seems unlikely), or he actually heard something. Suddenly, he caught the sound of a hand cautiously touching the lock and the rustle of a skirt right at the door. Someone was stealthily listening from the inside, just like he was on the outside… He shifted a bit and muttered something to break the silence.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist, agitated and conflicted, prepares to confront the old woman while grappling with his own anxiety and the weight of his intentions."
