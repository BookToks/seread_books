Like you were saying something new?” \n\n“Maybe,” Raskolnikov replied, rolling his eyes.\n\nRazumihin shifted in his seat. \n\n“So, if you ever faced tough times or needed to help humanity, would you break some rules? Like, rob and kill?” He winked and chuckled quietly.\n\n“If I did, I wouldn’t tell you,” Raskolnikov shot back, full of defiance.\n\n“I was just curious because of your article, you know, from a literary angle…”\n\n“Ugh!
