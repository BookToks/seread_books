  "text": "Mr. Luzhin is definitely a \"man of business\" and, sure, he seems kind. Sending all those bags and a big box? That's something, right? But here's the catch: his bride and her mom are stuck traveling in a peasant’s cart covered in sacking (trust me, I've been there). It’s just ninety versts (about 60 miles), and then they can ride third class for a thousand versts! Smart move, I guess. You've got to live within your means. But what about you, Mr. Luzhin? She’s your bride, after all. \n\nYou know her mom has to scrape together money from her pension for this trip. It’s all about business—a partnership where they share expenses. Food and drinks are covered, but you still have to pay for tobacco. Classic businessman move! The luggage will probably cost less than their tickets, if it doesn't go free. Why can’t they see this, or do they just not want to? They’re so happy! And this is just the beginning; the real deal is yet to come.\n\nBut what really stands out isn’t just the cheapness; it’s the overall vibe. This is a preview of what marriage will look like. And why is Mom being so generous? By the time they hit Petersburg, she’ll have maybe three silver roubles or two “paper ones,” as she calls them. What’s her plan for living in Petersburg after that? She already suspects she won’t be able to stay with Dounia after the wedding, even for a few months. That good man must have let something slip about it.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Mr. Luzhin's apparent kindness is overshadowed by the practical and meager realities of his engagement to Dounia and her mother's financial struggles."
