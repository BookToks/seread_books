He bought unredeemed stuff from the old woman, right?”\n\n“Yeah, he’s a total scammer. He buys up bad debts for a living. But let’s not waste more time on him! What really ticks me off is their disgusting, outdated routines. This case could shake things up and introduce a new approach. You can prove, just from the psychology behind it, how to find the real culprit. They keep saying, ‘We have facts.’ But facts aren’t everything—how you interpret them is at least half the battle!”\n\n“Can you interpret them?”\n\n“Honestly, I can’t just sit back when I feel like I could help if only… Do you know the details of the case?”\n\n“I’m still waiting to hear about the painter.”\n\n“Oh, right! So here’s the scoop. Three days after the murder, while they were still questioning Koch and Pestryakov—who had alibis as clear as day—something unexpected popped up. A peasant named Dushkin, who runs a bar across from the murder scene, brought a jeweler’s case with some gold earrings to the police. He had a whole story to tell. ‘Just the day before yesterday, around eight o’clock’—remember that date and time!—‘a house painter named Nikolay, who had already visited me that day, gave me this box of gold earrings and stones and asked me to keep it safe.’”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The discussion revolves around the inadequacies of the legal system and the potential for a new investigative method based on psychological interpretation of evidence."
