He left a note saying he was in full control of his mind and that no one was to blame for his death. They say he had money. How do you know him?”\n\n“I was acquainted. My sister was a governess for his family.”\n\n“Got it! So you can tell us something about him. Did you have any suspicions?”\n\n“I saw him yesterday. He was drinking wine; I didn’t know anything else.”\n\nRaskolnikov felt like something heavy had dropped on him, making it hard to breathe.\n\n“You’re looking pale again. It’s stuffy in here…”\n\n“Yeah, I need to go,” Raskolnikov muttered. “Sorry for bothering you…”\n\n“Oh, not at all! Come by anytime. It’s nice to see you,” Ilya Petrovitch said, offering his hand.\n\n“I just wanted to see Zametov.”\n\n“Got it, got it. Always a pleasure!”\n\n“I’m glad… goodbye,” Raskolnikov smiled weakly.\n\nHe stepped outside, feeling dizzy and unsure of himself. As he headed down the stairs, he used his right hand to steady himself against the wall. He thought he felt a porter brush past him.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov learns about a man who committed suicide, leaving behind a note absolving others of blame, which deeply unsettles him."
