  "text": "\"Stop, Sonia, please! Don’t make this harder for me,\" he pleaded, feeling desperate. This wasn’t how he planned to tell her at all, but here they were.\n\nSonia jumped up, clearly panicking, and paced the room. Then she quickly sat back down next to him, their shoulders almost touching. Suddenly, she gasped as if she’d been stabbed, cried out, and fell to her knees in front of him, not really knowing why.\n\n\"What have you done—what have you done to yourself?\" she exclaimed, full of despair. Then she threw her arms around him, holding him tightly.\n\nRaskolnikov pulled back slightly, giving her a sad smile. \"You’re such a strange girl, Sonia. You hug me and kiss me even when I tell you about... that. You don’t really think about what you’re doing.\"\n\n\"There’s no one in the world as unhappy as you!\" she shouted, lost in her emotions, and then she broke down in tears.\n\nA feeling he hadn’t felt in a long time washed over him, softening his heart. He didn’t fight it. Two tears formed in his eyes, clinging to his lashes.\n\n\"Then you won’t leave me, Sonia?\" he asked, looking at her with a hint of hope.\n\n\"No, no, never, nowhere!\" she cried. \"I will follow you.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia expresses her deep emotional connection to Raskolnikov, vowing to never leave him despite his turmoil."
