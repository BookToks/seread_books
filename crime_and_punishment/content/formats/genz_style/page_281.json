Have you seen Luzhin?” \n\n“No, Rodya, but he knows we’re here. We heard he was nice enough to visit you today,” Pulcheria said, a bit shyly. \n\n“Yeah... he was so nice. Dounia, I told Luzhin I’d throw him down the stairs and told him to get lost…” \n\n“Rodya, what are you saying? You can’t be serious!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna gasped, but she trailed off, looking at Dounia. \n\nAvdotya Romanovna watched her brother closely, waiting to see what he’d say next. They both knew about the fight from Nastasya, and it left them feeling tense and confused. \n\n“Dounia,” Raskolnikov said with effort, “I don’t want that marriage. Tomorrow, you have to refuse Luzhin right away, so we never have to hear his name again.” \n\n“Oh my goodness!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna exclaimed.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov insists that his sister Dounia must refuse her marriage to Luzhin, expressing his distress and desire to end the connection."
