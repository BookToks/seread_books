  "text": "Raskolnikovâ€™s younger brother was buried in a little grave marked by a stone. He never knew him; he died when he was just six months old. But every time Raskolnikov visited the graveyard, he would cross himself and bow down to kiss that little grave with respect. \n\nIn his dream, he was walking with his dad past a tavern on the way to the graveyard. He held his father's hand and felt uneasy about the tavern. Something caught his eye: there was a party vibe happening. Crowds of colorful townspeople, peasant women, their husbands, and all sorts of rowdy folks were singing and mostly drunk. \n\nNear the tavern entrance stood a weird cart. It was one of those big carts usually pulled by strong horses, loaded with barrels of wine or heavy stuff. Raskolnikov loved watching those powerful horses with their long manes and thick legs, effortlessly moving heavy loads. But now, he saw a scrawny little sorrel horse in the shafts. It was one of those poor nags that struggled under heavy wood or hay, especially when the wheels got stuck in mud. \n\nHe remembered how cruelly peasants would beat them, even on their noses and eyes. That thought made him so sad he almost cried. His mom used to pull him away from the window whenever he saw that. Suddenly, there was a loud uproar of shouting, singing, and the sound of a balalaika (a traditional Russian string instrument).\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov dreams of walking with his father to his younger brother's grave, feeling a mix of dread and sympathy for a struggling horse he sees in a festive scene."
