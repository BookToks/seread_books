Check this out!’ Razumihin pulled out Raskolnikov’s old boot, caked in mud. ‘I didn’t come empty-handed—they measured from this monster. We did our best!’ He continued, ‘Your landlady sorted out your linen. Here are three shirts—hemp, but with a trendy front.’  \n\nHe broke down the costs: ‘The cap was eighty copecks, the suit two roubles twenty-five copecks—totaling three roubles five copecks. The boots were a rouble and a half because they’re solid. That brings us to four roubles fifty-five copecks. Then five roubles for the underclothes, bought in the lo—so that’s nine roubles fifty-five copecks total. Here’s forty-five copecks in change. You’re all set now, Rodya! Your overcoat works too; it’s got style from Sharmer’s! As for your socks and other stuff, you’ve got twenty-five roubles left. Don’t stress about Pashenka or your rent; she’ll trust you. Now, let’s change your linen. You’ll feel better once you do!’  \n\n‘Just leave me alone! I don’t want to!’ Raskolnikov waved him off, feeling grossed out by Razumihin’s attempts to lighten the mood.  \n\n‘Come on, don’t tell me I walked around for nothing!’ Razumihin pushed back. ‘Nastasya, help me out here.’ Despite Raskolnikov’s protests, he changed his linen. Raskolnikov sank back on the bed.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin presents Raskolnikov with a new set of clothes and insists on helping him despite his reluctance."
