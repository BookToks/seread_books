He looked down—it was an older woman in a kerchief and goat-skin shoes, with a girl, probably her daughter, wearing a hat and holding a green parasol. \n\n“Take it, my good man, in Christ’s name.” \n\nHe took it, and they walked on. It was twenty copecks. Honestly, with how he looked, they probably thought he was a beggar asking for change. That twenty copecks was likely a pity gift after seeing him like that. \n\nHe closed his hand around the coins, walked ten paces, then turned to face the Neva, staring at the palace. The sky was clear, and the water was almost bright blue—a rare sight for the Neva. The cathedral’s cupola sparkled in the sunlight, and from the bridge nearby, every detail of it stood out in the crisp air. \n\nThe pain from the lash faded, and Raskolnikov forgot about it. Instead, one uneasy thought consumed him. He stood still, gazing into the distance at a spot he knew well. Back in university, he’d often pause here on his way home, marveling at the stunning view. Yet, it always left him feeling strangely cold; this beautiful scene felt blank and lifeless to him. He’d wonder about the dark, mysterious feelings it stirred up but kept pushing off trying to figure it out.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov receives a small donation from a woman, prompting him to reflect on his past feelings of detachment and the beauty of his surroundings."
