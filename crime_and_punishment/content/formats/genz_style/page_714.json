  "text": "Svidrigaïlov finally realized he was on a mission. He got up and headed straight out the door. A minute later, he was outside. \n\nA thick, milky mist hung over the town. He walked carefully along the slippery, grimy wooden sidewalk towards the Little Neva. He imagined the river swollen from the night rain, the wet paths, the drenched grass, and the soaked trees and bushes. Trying to shake off his bad mood, he stared at the houses around him. The streets were empty—no cabs, no people. The bright yellow wooden houses looked dirty and sad with their shutters shut tight. The cold and damp seeped into his bones, making him shiver. \n\nEvery now and then, he passed shop signs and read them closely. Eventually, he reached the end of the wooden walkway and came to a big stone building. A dirty, shivering dog crossed his path, tail tucked between its legs. Nearby, a man lay face down on the pavement, dead drunk. Svidrigaïlov glanced at him and kept walking. \n\nHe spotted a tall tower to his left. “Bah!” he shouted, “This is a spot! Why not here? At least there’ll be an official witness…” \n\nThat thought almost made him smile. He turned onto the street with the big tower house. At the closed gates stood a little man leaning against them, wrapped in a grey soldier’s coat and wearing a copper helmet. The man glanced at Svidrigaïlov with a sleepy, indifferent look. His face had that constant sour expression, like he was always annoyed.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov walks through a desolate town, contemplating his surroundings and his intentions."
