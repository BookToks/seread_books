With a fake slyness, he looked at Raskolnikov, laughed, and said, “This morning, I went to see Sonia. I asked her for a little boost! He-he-he!” \n\n“You don’t mean she actually gave it to you?” one guy shouted, bursting into laughter.\n\n“This very quart was bought with her money,” Marmeladov said, directing his words at Raskolnikov. “She handed me thirty copecks—her last cash, all she had. I could see it in her eyes… She didn’t say anything, just looked at me. Up there, they care about us, they cry for us, but they don’t judge us. But it hurts more when they don’t judge! Thirty copecks! Maybe she needs them now, huh? What do you think, sir? She has to keep up appearances. That costs money, you know? \n\nAnd there’s pomade too! She has to have things—petticoats, starched ones, and shoes that show off her foot when she steps over a puddle. Do you get it? And here I am, her own father, taking thirty copecks of that money for a drink! And I’m drinking it! Who will pity a guy like me, huh? Are you sorry for me, sir, or what?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marmeladov expresses his despair over his alcoholism and the guilt of taking money from his daughter Sonia, highlighting the pain of his situation."
