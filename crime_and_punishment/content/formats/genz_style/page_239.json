He forced a twisted smile. “But is that even possible?” he managed to say. Raskolnikov shot him a furious look. \n\n“Admit it, you believed it, didn’t you?”\n\n“Not at all! I believe it less than ever now,” Zametov stammered, clearly panicking.\n\n“Gotcha! So you did believe it before, if you’re saying you believe it less now?” \n\n“Not really!” Zametov protested, flustered. “Were you just trying to scare me into this?”\n\n“So you don’t believe it? Then why were you talking about me when I left the police station? And why did that intense lieutenant question me after I fainted?” He called over to the waiter, getting up and grabbing his cap. “How much do I owe?”\n\n“Thirty copecks,” the waiter replied, hurrying over.\n\n“And here’s twenty copecks for vodka. Look at all this cash!” He waved a handful of notes at Zametov—red and blue, twenty-five roubles. “Where did I get this? And what about my new clothes? I was broke! You probably interrogated my landlady, didn’t you? Well, that’s enough! Until next time!” \n\nHe left, shaking with a mix of anxiety and excitement.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confronts Zametov about the possibility of his involvement in the murders, revealing his inner turmoil and paranoia."
