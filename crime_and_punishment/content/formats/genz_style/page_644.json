But you can see for yourself how much of a jerk I am and how much I’m being real.\n\n“When are you going to arrest me?” \n\n“I could let you roam free for a day or two. Think it over, my guy, and maybe pray. It’s for your own good.”\n\n“And what if I bail?” Raskolnikov asked, flashing a weird smile.\n\n“No chance you’ll run. A peasant might dip out, or someone who just follows trends. But you? You’ve already ditched your own theory. What are you going to run away with? Hiding would suck for you. You need a solid spot, a vibe that fits you. If you took off, you’d just end up back where you started. You can’t escape us. \n\nAnd if I throw you in jail—let’s say for a month or two—you’ll end up confessing. You might not even see it coming. I’m sure you’ll decide to face your pain. Right now, you might doubt me, but you’ll come around. Suffering, Rodion Romanovitch, is powerful. Don’t laugh at that; I know what I’m talking about.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry Petrovitch suggests to Raskolnikov that he will ultimately confess to his crime as suffering is an inevitable part of his journey."
