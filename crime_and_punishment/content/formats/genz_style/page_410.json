  "text": "“Can you tell me why you’re here?” Raskolnikov asked, clearly annoyed. “I’m in a hurry and don’t have time for this. I need to leave.”\n\n“Of course. Your sister, Avdotya Romanovna, is set to marry Mr. Luzhin, Pyotr Petrovitch, right?” \n\n“Can you please stop talking about my sister? I don’t get how you have the nerve to say her name in front of me, especially if you really are Svidrigaïlov.”\n\n“I came here to talk about her. How can I not mention her?”\n\n“Fine, go ahead, but make it quick.”\n\n“I’m sure you’ve formed an opinion about Mr. Luzhin, even if you’ve only seen him for a short time or heard some facts. He’s not good enough for Avdotya Romanovna. Honestly, I think she’s making a huge mistake, sacrificing her happiness for her family. I thought you’d want to help break off this engagement without losing anything in the process. Now that I see you in person, I believe it even more.”\n\n“That’s pretty naïve… or maybe I should say rude,” Raskolnikov shot back.\n\n“So you think I have my own agenda? Don’t worry, Rodion Romanovitch. If I was looking out for myself, I wouldn’t be so straightforward.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confronts Svidrigaïlov about his intentions regarding his sister's marriage to Luzhin, expressing irritation and skepticism about Svidrigaïlov's motives."
