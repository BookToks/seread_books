  "text": "\"Hey, is there some kind of party happening at the widow's place?\" Pyotr Petrovitch suddenly interrupted Andrey Semyonovitch right when things were getting interesting.\n\n\"Wait, you don’t know? I was just saying last night how I feel about these ceremonies. I heard she invited you too. You talked to her yesterday, right?\"\n\n\"I can’t believe that broke widow would spend all the cash she got from that other loser, Raskolnikov, on this feast. I was shocked when I saw the wine and all the prep going on. She’s got several people invited. It’s wild!\" Pyotr Petrovitch seemed really into this topic. \"What? You say I’m invited too? When did that happen? I don’t remember. But I’m not going. Why would I? I just mentioned to her yesterday that she might get a year’s salary as a destitute widow of a government clerk. I guess that’s why she invited me, huh? He-he-he!\"\n\n\"I’m not going either,\" said Lebeziatnikov.\n\n\"Of course not, especially after you gave her a beating! You’d better think twice, he-he!\"\n\n\"Who beat who?\" Lebeziatnikov said, flustered and turning red.\n\n\"Come on, you thrashed Katerina Ivanovna a month ago. I heard about it yesterday. So much for your big ideas on women’s rights, huh? He-he-he!\" With that, Pyotr Petrovitch seemed satisfied and went back to clicking his beads.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pyotr Petrovitch discusses a feast being prepared by a widow, expressing surprise at her spending and revealing past conflicts with others involved."
