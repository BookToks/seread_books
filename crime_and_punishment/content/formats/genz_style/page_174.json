  "text": "The sun was shining into the room, casting a beam of light on the wall and by the door. Nastasya stood next to him with a stranger who was staring at him curiously. This guy was young, had a beard, wore a short coat, and looked like a messenger. The landlady peeked in through the half-open door. Raskolnikov sat up.\n\n“Who’s this, Nastasya?” he asked, pointing at the young man.\n\n“Hey, he’s back!” she exclaimed.\n\n“He’s back,” the stranger echoed.\n\nRealizing he was awake, the landlady quickly closed the door and vanished. She was always shy and didn't like to chat. She was around forty, not bad-looking, a bit plump, with black eyes and eyebrows. Her good nature came from being lazy and a little awkward.\n\n“Who… are you?” he asked the young man. Just then, the door swung open, and Razumihin ducked in, hitting his head on the doorframe.\n\n“What a place!” he exclaimed. “I keep banging my head! So, you’re awake, huh? I just heard from Pashenka.”\n\n“He just woke up,” Nastasya said.\n\n“Just woke up,” the stranger repeated with a grin.\n\n“And you are?” Razumihin asked, suddenly turning to him. “I’m Vrazumihin, by the way, not Razumihin, even though everyone calls me that.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov regains consciousness and is surrounded by curious onlookers, including a messenger and his friend Razumihin."
