I also shared some info on workers’ groups in France. Now, I’m diving into how people interact in a future society.\n\n‘What’s that about?’ \n\nRecently, we discussed whether someone can just walk into another person’s room, man or woman, whenever they want. And we decided: yes, they can!\n\n‘That could be super awkward, haha!’\n\nLebeziatnikov was not having it. \n\n‘You always think of the negative stuff,’ he snapped. ‘Ugh! It annoys me that I brought up personal space too soon. People like you just mock it before really understanding. And they act so proud of it! Ugh! I’ve said before that this topic should wait until someone really gets the system. Also, what’s so shameful about cesspools? I’d clean one out if needed. It’s just work—honorable and useful work.
