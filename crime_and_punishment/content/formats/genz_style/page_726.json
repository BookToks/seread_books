I’ve never understood this better than I do now, and I still don’t think what I did was a crime. Honestly, I’ve never felt stronger or more sure of myself than I do right now.”\n\nHis face flushed, but when he caught Dounia’s gaze, he saw so much pain in her eyes that it stopped him in his tracks. He realized he had made these two women miserable; he was the reason for their suffering.\n\n“Dounia, if I’m guilty, please forgive me (but honestly, I can’t be forgiven if I am guilty). Goodbye! Let’s not argue. It’s time for me to go. Please don’t follow me; I have somewhere else to be. But you need to go sit with Mom. I’m begging you! This is my last request. Don’t leave her alone; I left her worried sick, and she can’t handle it. She might break down. Be there for her! Razumihin will be with you; I talked to him about it. \n\nDon’t cry for me; I’ll try to live honestly and bravely, even if I’m a murderer. Maybe one day I’ll make a name for myself. I won’t let you down, you’ll see! \n\nNow, goodbye for now,” he said quickly, noticing that strange look in Dounia’s eyes again. “Why are you crying? Don’t cry, we’re not saying goodbye forever! Oh wait! I almost forgot!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist grapples with his guilt and the impact of his actions on his loved ones, asserting his conviction that he is not a criminal despite his confession."
