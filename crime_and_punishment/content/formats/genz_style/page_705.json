  "text": "Svidrigaïlov was still hearing the noise from the other room. It was like someone was getting a serious lecture—almost crying, too. But he only caught one voice. \n\nCurious, he got up, blocked the light with his hand, and peeked through a crack in the wall. The room next door was bigger and had two guys in it. One was a curly-haired dude with a bright red face, acting like he was giving a speech. He was all dramatic, standing with his legs apart and hitting his chest, telling the other guy he was a total loser. He claimed he pulled the other guy from the gutter and could kick him out anytime, saying it was all up to fate. \n\nThe guy getting roasted was slumped in a chair, looking like he really needed to sneeze but couldn’t. He had this dazed look in his eyes, like he had no clue what was going on. \n\nOn the table, a candle was burning low next to some wine glasses, a mostly empty vodka bottle, bread, and cucumber, plus some old tea dregs. After staring at that scene, Svidrigaïlov turned away, bored, and plopped back down on his bed.\n\nWhen the ragged attendant came back with his tea, he couldn’t help but ask again if Svidrigaïlov wanted anything else. But Svidrigaïlov just shook his head again. The attendant finally left, and Svidrigaïlov hurried to drink his tea to warm up, but he couldn’t eat anything. He was starting to feel feverish.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov observes a heated argument between two men in an adjacent room while feeling feverish and indifferent to his surroundings."
