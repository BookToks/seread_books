  "text": "I don’t want you to think I’m a monster. I actually like you, whether you believe it or not. So here’s the deal: I’m asking you to confess. It’ll be better for both of us—my job will be done, and you’ll be in a better spot. Sounds fair, right? \n\nRaskolnikov paused, thinking it over. \n\n“Listen, Porfiry Petrovitch. You just said you only have psychology to work with, but now you’re talking numbers. What if you’re wrong?” \n\n“I’m not wrong, Rodion Romanovitch. I’ve got a little fact that Providence sent my way.” \n\n“What fact?” \n\n“I can’t share that, Rodion Romanovitch. But I have to arrest you now. Think it over: this is for your own good. Trust me, it’ll be better.” \n\nRaskolnikov smirked. \n\n“That’s not just ridiculous; it’s shameless. Even if I were guilty, which I don’t admit, why would I confess if you say prison is safer for me?” \n\n“Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, don’t put too much faith in words. Prison might not be as chill as you think. That’s just a theory, and who am I to you? Maybe I’m hiding something too.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Porfiry Petrovitch proposes that Raskolnikov should confess to benefit both of them, despite Raskolnikov's skepticism about the necessity of a confession."
