  "text": "An expression of deep disgust flashed across the young man's face for a moment. He was strikingly handsome—tall, slim, with gorgeous dark eyes and rich brown hair. But soon, he fell into a deep haze, more like a blank state of mind. He walked without noticing his surroundings and didn’t care to. Occasionally, he muttered to himself, a habit he had just admitted to. During these moments, he realized his thoughts were jumbled and that he felt weak, having barely eaten in two days.\n\nHis clothes were so ragged that even someone used to shabby outfits would be embarrassed to wear them in public. But in this part of town, no one would bat an eye at a rough look. With the Hay Market nearby and a mix of shady spots and working-class folks crowding the streets of Petersburg, you could see all sorts of characters. No outfit, no matter how strange, would raise eyebrows here. Yet, the bitterness and contempt in the young man's heart made him care less about his rags when he was out on the street. It was a different story when he ran into acquaintances or former classmates, whom he really didn’t want to see. But when a drunken guy was being carted off in a huge wagon for some unknown reason, it didn’t faze him at all.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The young man, despite his handsome appearance, is consumed by disgust and bitterness, reflecting on his dire circumstances and the rags he wears."
