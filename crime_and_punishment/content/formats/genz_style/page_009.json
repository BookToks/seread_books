  "text": "An expression of deep disgust flashed across the young man's handsome face. He was tall, slim, and had striking dark eyes and brown hair. But soon, he fell into deep thought—or more like a complete mental blank. He walked around, not really noticing or caring about his surroundings. Sometimes, he muttered to himself, a habit he had just admitted to. In those moments, he realized his thoughts were all jumbled and he felt weak. He hadn’t eaten much in two days. \n\nHis clothes were so bad that even someone used to shabby outfits would feel embarrassed to be seen in public wearing them. But in that part of town, nobody would bat an eye at a rough look. With the nearby Hay Market and many sketchy places, the streets were filled with all kinds of people, so no one would be surprised by any odd appearance. Yet, the young man felt a deep bitterness and contempt inside. Despite being picky about his looks, he cared the least about his rags when he was on the street. It was a different story when he ran into acquaintances or old classmates—he really didn’t want to see them at all. But then, when a drunk guy was being taken somewhere in a huge wagon, it caught his attention.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The young man, despite his handsome appearance, is consumed by disgust and bitterness, feeling weak and ashamed in his ragged clothing as he navigates the streets of Petersburg."
