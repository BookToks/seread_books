  "text": "A look of deep disgust flashed across the young man’s striking face. He was tall, slim, and handsome, with gorgeous dark eyes and rich brown hair. But soon, he fell into a deep haze—more like a complete mental blackout. He walked around, barely noticing his surroundings and not caring to. Occasionally, he muttered to himself, a habit he had just admitted to. During these moments, he realized his thoughts were all jumbled, and he felt incredibly weak. He hadn’t eaten in two days.\n\nHis clothes were so shabby that even someone used to rough attire would be embarrassed to wear them outside. But in this part of town, where the Hay Market was nearby and shady places were common, no one would bat an eye at odd outfits. The streets were filled with all kinds of people, so nothing seemed too strange. Still, the bitterness and disdain in his heart made him care less about his rags while walking around. It was a different story when he ran into acquaintances or old classmates, whom he really didn’t want to see. Yet, when a drunken guy was being hauled away in a large wagon for some unknown reason, it didn’t seem to bother him at all.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The young man, despite his handsome appearance, is consumed by disgust and bitterness, feeling weak and ashamed in his ragged clothing as he navigates the streets of Petersburg."
