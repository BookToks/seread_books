  "text": "Raskolnikov felt the weight of his situation. “What a pity!” he recalled someone saying about his studies. He thought about Zametov and how he blabbed nonsense while drunk the night before. “I hope you aren’t blowing it out of proportion,” he said to Razumihin.\n\n“Madman? Maybe they’re right,” he replied, forcing a smile.\n\n“Not at all! But what I said—it was just drunken rambling,” Razumihin insisted.\n\n“Why are you even apologizing? I’m so over it!” Raskolnikov snapped, his irritation a bit over the top.\n\n“I get it. Trust me, I do. It’s embarrassing to even talk about,” Razumihin said.\n\n“If you’re embarrassed, then just drop it.” \n\nSilence fell between them. Razumihin seemed overly excited, which made Raskolnikov uneasy. He was also worried about what Razumihin mentioned about Porfiry.\n\n“I’ll have to act serious around him too,” Raskolnikov thought, feeling his heart race. “But acting natural would mean doing nothing… which isn’t natural either. Ugh, we’ll see how this plays out. Is it smart to go or not? Like a moth to a flame, my heart’s pounding, and that’s not good!”\n\n“In this grey house,” Razumihin said, breaking the tension.\n\n“Does Porfiry know what I did?” Raskolnikov wondered, anxiety creeping in.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov expresses his anxiety and irritation about his situation and the perceptions of those around him."
