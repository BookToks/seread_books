  "text": "Meanwhile, Raskolnikov turned a bit to face Pyotr Petrovitch, then suddenly stared at him with real curiosity, like he hadn’t really seen him before. He even sat up a little to get a better look. There was definitely something odd about Pyotr Petrovitch’s whole vibe, which made the term “fiancé” feel fitting, even if it was used casually. \n\nFirst off, it was super obvious that Pyotr Petrovitch had spent his short time in the city getting decked out for his future fiancée. Totally normal, right? He seemed a bit too proud of how he looked, which you could excuse since he was playing the fiancé role. His clothes were fresh from the tailor and looked good, but maybe a bit too new and definitely too perfect for the occasion. Even his stylish new round hat had a vibe—he treated it like it was a big deal, holding it carefully in his hands. \n\nThen there were those fancy lavender gloves, real Louvain, which he wasn’t even wearing but just showing off. The light, youthful colors in his outfit stood out. He rocked a cute summer jacket in a fawn shade, light trousers, a matching waistcoat, and a cravat with pink stripes. Honestly, it all suited him well. His fresh, even handsome face looked younger than his actual age.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov observes Pyotr Petrovitch's overly polished appearance, which reflects his eagerness to impress as a fiancé."
