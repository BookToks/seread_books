It’s like a tactic to throw the person off guard, right? Then, boom! They hit you with a killer question out of nowhere. Classic move, isn’t it? I think I read that in some law manual.” \n\n“Yeah, yeah… You think that’s why I brought up government buildings?” Porfiry replied, squinting and winking. He had this playful, sly look on his face. His forehead smoothed out, eyes narrowed, features relaxed, and then he burst into a loud, nervous laugh, shaking as he looked straight at Raskolnikov. \n\nRaskolnikov forced a laugh, too, but when Porfiry’s laughter got so loud it turned his face red, Raskolnikov’s irritation took over. He stopped laughing, scowled, and glared at Porfiry, keeping his eyes locked on him while Porfiry continued his exaggerated laughter. Both of them were being reckless; Porfiry seemed to be laughing right in Raskolnikov’s face, completely unfazed by how annoyed Raskolnikov was.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov and Porfiry Petrovitch engage in a tense exchange, highlighting the psychological tactics used in legal interrogations."
