  "text": "Human nature isnâ€™t even considered here. Itâ€™s totally ignored! People think a perfect society will just pop up overnight from some genius plan. They donâ€™t get that society evolves through real-life experiences. Instead, they dismiss history as just a mess of stupidity. They want a world that feels dead, something that doesnâ€™t fight back. \n\nBut thatâ€™s not how life works! A living soul craves real experiences. It wonâ€™t just follow rules like a robot. What they want is lifeless, like a rubber toyâ€”compliant and unchallenging. \n\nIn the end, theyâ€™re all about building walls and planning out spaces in some utopian setup. Sure, that plan looks nice, but human nature isnâ€™t ready for it. We want to live, not just exist in a graveyard! You canâ€™t just logic your way past nature. Logic might suggest a few options, but there are countless possibilities. \n\nNarrow it down to just comfort? Thatâ€™s the easy way out. It sounds clear-cut, but itâ€™s a trap. The key is not to overthink it. Thatâ€™s the real takeaway! ðŸ“š\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The text critiques the notion that a perfect social system can be created without considering the complexities of human nature and historical development."
