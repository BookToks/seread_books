  "text": "If I lock him up too soon—even if I think he’s the guy—I might miss out on more evidence against him. Here’s the deal: if I give him a clear status, he’ll stop worrying and go back into his shell. \n\nRemember Sevastopol? After the battle of Alma, everyone was freaked out that the enemy would attack right away. But when they saw the enemy was going for a long siege instead, they were actually relieved. They figured it would drag on for at least two months. \n\nYou’re laughing, right? You think I’m joking? Fair enough, you’re not wrong. These are unique situations, I get that. But listen, Rodion Romanovitch, the typical case that all the legal rules are based on? It doesn’t really exist. Every crime, as soon as it happens, turns into its own special case, often unlike anything before it. \n\nSometimes, the weirdest situations pop up. If I leave one guy alone, don’t bother him, but let him know I’m watching him all the time, he’ll freak out. The constant suspicion and fear will drive him crazy. He’ll either come to me or do something that makes it obvious he’s guilty—it’s almost too easy. This might work with a simple peasant, but with someone smart and educated? It’s a sure thing. 😏\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The speaker argues that allowing a suspected criminal to remain in suspense can lead to revealing evidence, as the psychological pressure may drive them to act in ways that confirm their guilt."
