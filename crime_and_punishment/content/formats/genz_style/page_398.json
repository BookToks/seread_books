  "text": "Raskolnikov stared at Svidrigaïlov, lost in thought. \n\n“Are you saying I harassed an innocent girl and made disgusting proposals? Is that it?” (I can guess what you’re thinking.) “But look, I’m human too. I can feel love and attraction, and that’s not something we control. So, what’s the deal? Am I a monster, or am I just another victim? If I asked her to run away with me to America or Switzerland, maybe I really thought it would make us both happy! Passion can cloud judgment, you know. I might’ve been hurting myself more than anyone else!”\n\n“But that’s not the issue,” Raskolnikov cut in, clearly annoyed. “Right or wrong, we just don’t like you. We want nothing to do with you. So, please leave!”\n\nSvidrigaïlov suddenly burst out laughing. “You’re tough to deal with! I thought I could charm you, but you saw right through me!”\n\n“But you’re still trying to charm me!” \n\n“What’s wrong with that?” he laughed. “This is just a game, a harmless little trick! Anyway, you interrupted me.
