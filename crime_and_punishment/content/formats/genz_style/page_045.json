  "text": "The presence of a servant girl who had to wait on him made him super anxious. He was totally fixated on one thing. For the past two weeks, his landlady had stopped bringing him meals, and he hadn’t even bothered to complain, even though he was skipping dinner. Nastasya, the cook and only servant, was actually enjoying his mood and had pretty much stopped cleaning his room. She only popped in with a broom once a week. Today, she woke him up.\n\n“Get up! Why are you still sleeping?” she called. “It’s past nine! I brought you some tea. You must be starving!” \n\nRaskolnikov opened his eyes, startled, and recognized Nastasya. \n\n“From the landlady, right?” he asked, sitting up on the sofa with a sickly look.\n\n“Yep, from the landlady!” she replied. \n\nShe set down her cracked teapot filled with weak, stale tea and placed two yellow sugar cubes beside it. \n\n“Here, Nastasya, take this,” he said, fumbling around in his pocket (he’d slept in his clothes) and pulling out some coins. “Run and get me a loaf. And grab a cheap sausage from the butcher.” \n\n“I’ll get the loaf right away, but wouldn’t you rather have some cabbage soup instead of sausage? It’s great soup, yesterday’s. I saved it for you!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is in a state of irritability and neglect, struggling with his living conditions and lack of food."
