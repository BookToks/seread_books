  "text": "The weight of his last hours felt like a heavy backpack, and he suddenly craved a pure, intense feeling. It hit him like a wave; a spark ignited in his soul and spread like wildfire. Everything inside him softened, and tears welled up in his eyes. He dropped to the ground right there.\n\nHe knelt in the square, bowed to the dirt, and kissed it with pure joy. Then he stood up and bowed again.\n\n“Looks like he’s had a few too many,” a nearby guy said.\n\nLaughter erupted.\n\n“He’s off to Jerusalem, saying goodbye to his kids and country. Kissing the ground of St. Petersburg!” a tipsy worker chimed in.\n\n“Such a young guy, too!” someone else noted.\n\n“And a gentleman,” another added seriously.\n\n“Who even knows what a gentleman is these days?” \n\nThese comments made Raskolnikov pause, and the words “I am a murderer” that almost slipped out faded away. He took it all in quietly, then turned down a street toward the police station. On his way, he caught a glimpse of something he expected to see. When he bowed again in the Hay Market, he spotted Sonia hiding behind one of the wooden stalls.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov experiences a profound emotional moment of humility and connection to the world, kneeling and kissing the ground, before heading towards the police office."
