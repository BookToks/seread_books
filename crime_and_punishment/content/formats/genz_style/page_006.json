  "text": "On a super hot evening in July, a young guy stepped out of his tiny attic room in S. Place. He walked slowly, looking kinda unsure, towards K. bridge. \n\nHe had dodged his landlady on the stairs. His attic was more like a cupboard than a proper room, sitting under the roof of a tall five-story building. The landlady, who gave him the attic, meals, and some help, lived right below him.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A young man hesitates as he leaves his cramped garret on a hot evening in July."
