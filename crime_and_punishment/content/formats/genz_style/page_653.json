  "text": "“I think you’ve been out of it for a couple of days. I told you about this tavern, so it’s no surprise you ended up here. Remember when I explained how to get here and when to find me?” \n\n“I don’t remember,” Raskolnikov replied, surprised.\n\n“I believe you. I told you twice. It’s like the address is stuck in your brain. You took this route without even thinking about it. Back then, I didn’t expect you to get it. You reveal too much about yourself, Rodion Romanovitch. \n\nAlso, I’m pretty sure a lot of people in Petersburg talk to themselves while walking. This city is full of oddballs. If we had more scientists, doctors, and philosophers, they could do some serious research here. There are few places with such heavy, weird vibes affecting people’s minds as Petersburg. The climate alone has a huge impact. Plus, it’s the heart of Russia, so its mood spreads across the country. But that’s not the main point right now. \n\nI’ve watched you a few times. You step out of your house with your head held high, but after about twenty steps, you let it drop and fold your hands behind your back. You look around but don’t really see anything. Then you start mumbling to yourself, sometimes waving your hand like you’re giving a speech, and you just stop in the middle of the street. That’s not normal. 😬”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's mechanical behavior and introspective nature are observed and commented on by Svidrigaïlov, highlighting the psychological impact of Petersburg's environment."
