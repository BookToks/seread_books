It must open some strong box instead, and he figured that’s where the good stuff was hidden. He left the chest and felt under the bed, knowing old ladies usually stash boxes there. Sure enough, he found a solid box about a yard long, with a red leather lid studded with steel nails. The notched key worked perfectly and unlocked it.\n\nUnder a white sheet was a red brocade coat lined with hareskin. Beneath that was a silk dress, a shawl, and it looked like just clothes were left. He wiped his blood-stained hands on the red brocade, thinking, “It’s red, so the blood won’t show as much.” Then panic hit him: “Am I losing it?” \n\nAs he touched the clothes, a gold watch slipped out from under the fur coat. He hurried to check everything. There were gold items mixed in with the clothes—probably stuff that was pawned and never picked up: bracelets, chains, earrings, pins, and more. Some were in cases, others wrapped neatly in newspaper and taped. Without wasting time, he stuffed his pockets with whatever he could grab, not even bothering to check what he was taking.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist discovers a hidden box under the bed containing valuable items, prompting a frantic and desperate act of theft."
