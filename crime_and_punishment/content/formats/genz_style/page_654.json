I can’t fix your problems, but you get what I mean.”\n\n“Do you know I’m being followed?” Raskolnikov asked, eyeing him closely.\n\n“Nope, I don’t know anything about that,” Svidrigaïlov replied, acting surprised.\n\n“Well, then, just leave me alone,” Raskolnikov muttered, frowning.\n\n“Fine, let’s drop it.”\n\n“Seriously, if you came here to drink and told me twice to find you, why did you hide and try to bail when I peeked in from the street? I saw you.”\n\n“He-he! And why were you lying on your sofa with your eyes shut, pretending to be asleep while I was at your door? I saw that too.”\n\n“I might have had… reasons. You know that.”\n\n“And I might have my reasons too, even if you don’t know them.”\n\nRaskolnikov propped his elbow on the table, resting his chin on his hand, and stared hard at Svidrigaïlov. He studied his face for a full minute. It was an odd face, almost like a mask—white and red, with striking red lips, a light beard, and thick, light hair. His eyes were too blue, and they had a heavy, fixed look. There was something really unsettling about that good-looking face, which seemed so young for his age.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov and Svidrigaïlov engage in a tense conversation filled with suspicion and hidden motives."
