  "text": "I donâ€™t know exactly when, but it should be soonâ€”like, maybe in a week. It all hinges on Pyotr Petrovitch. Heâ€™s eager to get the ceremony done ASAP, possibly even before the fast of Our Lady, or right after if thatâ€™s too soon. I canâ€™t wait to hug you! Dounia is super excited about seeing you too. She joked that sheâ€™d marry Pyotr Petrovitch just for that reason. Sheâ€™s the best! ðŸŒŸ \n\nSheâ€™s not writing to you right now because she has so much to share that a few lines wouldnâ€™t cut it. Plus, it might stress her out. She sends you tons of love and kisses! ðŸ˜˜ Even though weâ€™ll be together soon, I might send you some money in a day or two. Now that everyone knows Dounia is marrying Pyotr Petrovitch, my credit has improved. Afanasy Ivanovitch will trust me with up to seventy-five roubles based on my pension, so I might be able to send you twenty-five or even thirty roubles. \n\nIâ€™d send more, but Iâ€™m worried about our travel costs. Pyotr Petrovitch is being nice and covering part of our journey, like transporting our bags and big trunk through some of his contacts. Still, we need to budget for when we get to Petersburg because we canâ€™t arrive broke.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia is excited about her upcoming marriage to Pyotr Petrovitch, and they are planning their journey to Petersburg while managing their finances."
