How does it go? I can’t remember. Help me out!’ \n\nShe was super agitated and tried to sit up. Finally, in a hoarse, broken voice, she started to sing, gasping for breath with every word, her face filled with fear. \n\n‘In the heat of midday! … in the vale! … of Dagestan! … With lead in my breast! …’ \n\nSuddenly, she wailed, tears streaming down her face, ‘Your excellency! Protect the orphans! You’ve been their father’s guest… like, aristocratic….’ \n\nShe jolted back to reality, looking around in panic until she recognized Sonia. \n\n‘Sonia, Sonia!’ she said softly, almost in disbelief. ‘You’re here too, darling?’ \n\nThey lifted her up again. \n\n‘Enough! It’s over! Goodbye, poor thing! I’m done for! I’m broken!’ she cried in despair, her head falling back onto the pillow. \n\nShe slipped into unconsciousness again, but this time it didn’t last long. Her pale, frail face dropped, her mouth opened, her leg twitched, she let out a deep sigh, and then she died. \n\nSonia collapsed onto her, wrapping her arms around her, staying still with her head pressed against the lifeless body.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A dying woman expresses despair and relinquishes her children to Sonia, who mourns her loss."
