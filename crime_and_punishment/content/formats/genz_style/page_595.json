  "text": "Itâ€™s tough for Katerina Ivanovna to get, but did you know theyâ€™ve been trying to treat mental illness in Paris with just logic? ðŸ¤” A well-known professor who recently passed away believed it could work. He thought that mentally ill people arenâ€™t physically broken; they just have a wrong way of seeing things, like a logic fail. He would help them see their mistakes, and guess what? They say he had some success! But he also used water treatments, so itâ€™s unclear how much that helped. \n\nRaskolnikov had zoned out by now. When he got to his place, he nodded at Lebeziatnikov and headed inside. Lebeziatnikov jolted awake, looked around, and hurried off. \n\nRaskolnikov stepped into his cramped room and paused. Why was he back here? He stared at the yellowed, worn-out paper, the dust, and his old sofa. Outside, there was loud bangingâ€”someone was hammering away. He tiptoed to the window and peered out for a long time, trying to focus. But the yard was empty, and he couldnâ€™t figure out who was making all that noise. He noticed some open windows next door with sad-looking geraniums and laundry hanging out. He knew this scene by heart. With a sigh, he turned away and plopped down on the sofa.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reflects on the idea that insanity may stem from a logical error rather than a physical ailment, while feeling disconnected and absorbed in his own thoughts."
