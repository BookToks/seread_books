  "text": "Raskolnikov was drawn to the chaos and music coming from the saloon below. 🎶 He could hear someone dancing wildly, stomping to the beat of a guitar and a high-pitched voice singing a catchy tune. He leaned in closer, peeking from the sidewalk, feeling a mix of gloom and curiosity.\n\n“Oh, my handsome soldier, don’t beat me for nothing,” sang the voice, and Raskolnikov was desperate to catch the lyrics, as if it held some kind of meaning for him.\n\n“Should I go in?” he wondered. “Everyone’s laughing. Should I just get drunk?”\n\n“Won’t you come in?” a young woman called out, her voice lighter and more pleasant than the others. She was cute, not at all unpleasant to look at.\n\n“Wow, she’s pretty,” he thought, straightening up to look at her.\n\n“You’re not so bad yourself,” she replied with a smile, clearly flattered.\n\n“Isn’t he a bit too thin?” chimed in another woman, her voice deep and teasing. “Did you just get out of a hospital?”\n\n“They all act like they’re fancy, but look at those snub noses,” a tipsy peasant joked, grinning as he wore his loose coat. “They’re having a blast!”\n\n“Shut it!” one of the women shot back.\n\n“I’m just playing, sweetheart!” he laughed, then rushed down into the saloon.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is drawn to the lively atmosphere of a saloon, contemplating whether to join in the revelry."
