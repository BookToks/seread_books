  "text": "‘Wait, you seriously haven’t heard anything yet?’ Pyotr Petrovitch asked, looking a bit thrown off. \n\nRaskolnikov just sank back on the pillow, hands behind his head, staring at the ceiling. Luzhin's face fell. Zossimov and Razumihin watched him closely, and soon Raskolnikov looked clearly embarrassed. \n\n“I thought a letter sent over ten days ago… maybe even two weeks… would’ve reached you…” he stammered. \n\n“Hey, why are you just standing there?” Razumihin cut in. “If you’ve got something to say, sit down. Nastasya, make some space. Here’s a chair, just squeeze in!” \n\nHe pulled his chair back, creating a bit of room, and waited awkwardly for the visitor to wiggle through. It was a moment that made it hard to say no, so the visitor hurried in, stumbling a bit. Once he reached the chair, he plopped down, eyeing Razumihin with suspicion. \n\n“Chill out,” Razumihin said quickly. “Rodya’s been sick for five days and out of it for three, but he’s getting better and has an appetite now. This is his doctor, who just checked on him. I’m Rodya’s buddy, also a former student, and I’m taking care of him. So just ignore us and keep talking.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, recovering from illness, is visited by Pyotr Petrovitch, who is disconcerted by the lack of communication regarding Raskolnikov's condition."
