  "text": "“Alright, let’s get down to it! We’re all a bit silly here. This is my buddy Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov. He knows about you and wants to meet up. Plus, he’s got a little business to discuss. So, Zametov, what are you doing here? You two know each other?” \n\nRaskolnikov felt a bit uneasy. \n\nZametov looked surprised, but not too much. “We met at your place yesterday,” he replied casually. \n\n“Great! Saves me the trouble. He’s been asking me to introduce you all week. Looks like you two have already sniffed each other out. By the way, where’s your tobacco?” \n\nPorfiry Petrovitch was dressed in a clean dressing gown, fresh linen, and worn-down slippers. He was about thirty-five, short, and a bit chubby. He had a clean-shaven face with short hair and a big round head, especially at the back. His face was a sickly yellow but had a lively, ironic vibe. It looked friendly, but his eyes told a different story—watery and almost sad under pale, blinking eyelashes. Those eyes made his soft, somewhat feminine appearance seem way more serious than you’d expect. \n\nOnce Porfiry heard Raskolnikov had some business to discuss, he invited him to sit down.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is introduced to Porfiry Petrovitch, indicating he has a business matter to discuss."
