And look, one of you is wearing a hat! Get lost! At least show some respect for the dead!” \n\nHer cough was fierce, but it got their attention. They clearly respected her. One by one, the lodgers squeezed back into the doorway, feeling that odd mix of satisfaction and discomfort that happens when something shocking occurs, even if they care about the person affected.\n\nOutside, voices were talking about the hospital, saying they shouldn’t be causing a scene here. \n\n“No business to die!” Katerina Ivanovna shouted, storming toward the door to confront them. But she ran into Madame Lippevechsel, the landlady, who had just heard about the accident and rushed in to restore order. She was a feisty German with a knack for stirring things up.\n\n“Oh my God!” she exclaimed, hands clasped. “Your husband was trampled by drunken horses! He needs to go to the hospital! I’m the landlady!” \n\nKaterina Ivanovna shot back, “Amalia Ludwigovna, please remember what you’re saying.” She always took a haughty tone with the landlady to remind her of her place, and she wasn’t about to stop now.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna confronts the crowd and the landlady about the disrespect shown towards her injured husband, Marmeladov."
