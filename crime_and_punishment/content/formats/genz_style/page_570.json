But the moment she saw him, she jumped up like she’d been waiting for him. \n\n“What would I do without you?” she blurted out, rushing to meet him in the middle of the room. \n\nShe clearly needed to say this. Raskolnikov took a seat at the table, right where she had just been. She stood a couple of steps away, just like the day before. \n\n“Well, Sonia?” he said, his voice shaking. “It was all because of your social situation and the stuff that comes with it. Did you get that?” \n\nHer face showed she was upset. \n\n“Just don’t talk to me like you did yesterday,” she cut in. “Please, don’t start that again. There’s enough misery already.” \n\nShe forced a smile, worried he’d take it the wrong way. \n\n“I was dumb to leave. What’s happening there now? I wanted to go back right away, but I kept thinking you’d come.” \n\nHe told her that Amalia Ivanovna was kicking them out of their place and that Katerina Ivanovna had run off to “seek justice.” \n\n“Oh my God!” Sonia exclaimed. “Let’s go right now…” \n\nShe grabbed her cape. \n\n“It’s always the same thing!” Raskolnikov snapped, annoyed. “You only care about them! Stay here for a bit.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia expresses her gratitude to Raskolnikov for his support, while he struggles with his own emotions and the turmoil surrounding their lives."
