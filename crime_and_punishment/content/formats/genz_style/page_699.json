Your siblings are taken care of; I’ve put their money in a safe place and have the receipts. You should keep them, just in case. Here, take them! Now, about this: I’ve got three 5-percent bonds worth three thousand roubles. This is for you—just you. Keep it between us, no one else needs to know. You’ll need this money because living the same way isn’t good for you, and honestly, it’s not necessary anymore.”\n\n“I owe you so much, and so do the kids and my stepmom,” Sonia said quickly. “If I haven’t said much… please don’t think…”\n\n“That’s enough!” he interrupted. \n\n“But about the money, Arkady Ivanovitch, I appreciate it, but I don’t need it right now. I can earn my own living. Don’t think I’m ungrateful. If you’re being generous, that money…”\n\n“It’s for you, Sofya Semyonovna. No need to overthink it. I don’t have time for that. You’ll need it. Rodion Romanovitch has two options: a bullet to the head or Siberia.” (Sonia gasped and looked at him in shock.) “Don’t worry; I know all about it from him. I’m not spreading rumors. It was good advice when you told him to turn himself in and confess. That would be a better choice.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Arkady Ivanovitch gives Sonia three 5-percent bonds for her future needs, emphasizing the importance of the money due to Rodion's dire situation."
