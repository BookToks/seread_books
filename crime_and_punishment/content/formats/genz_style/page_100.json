  "text": "Raskolnikov thought about how many lives could be saved if he just took the old woman's money. She had helped so many families escape poverty, ruin, and disease—all thanks to her cash. So, if he killed her, wouldn’t that one crime be worth it if it meant saving thousands? One life for a hundred? It’s just math! Plus, what’s the value of that sickly, mean old woman? She’s not worth more than a bug, really. In fact, she’s worse because she harms others. Just the other day, she hurt Lizaveta so badly that they almost had to amputate her finger.\n\n“Sure, she doesn’t deserve to live,” the officer said. “But that’s just nature.”\n\n“Yeah, but we need to fix nature, or we’ll drown in old prejudices. Without that, we’d never have great people. They talk about duty and conscience—I’m not against those—but what do they really mean? Hold on, I’ve got another question for you.”\n\n“No, you wait! I’ve got a question first. Would you actually kill the old woman?” \n\n“Not a chance! I was just arguing about the idea of it. It’s not my thing…”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov rationalizes the idea of committing murder for the greater good, believing that one life can be sacrificed to save many others."
