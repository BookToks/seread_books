  "text": "I can see you're dealing with something heavy. When you walked in, I picked up on it right away, which is why I started talking to you. I’m here to share my life story, not to be a joke for these people who already know it all. I’m looking for someone who gets it, someone educated and compassionate.\n\nSo, here’s the deal: my wife went to a fancy school for girls from noble families. She even danced in front of the governor and got a gold medal for it. That medal? Yeah, it’s long gone. But she still has the certificate of merit tucked away in her trunk. Recently, she showed it to our landlady, even though they don’t get along. She just wanted someone to know about her past glory and happier times. I get it; it’s all she has left.\n\nShe’s a proud woman, strong-willed. She cleans our floors and only eats black bread, but she won’t let anyone disrespect her. That’s why she couldn’t let Mr. Lebeziatnikov’s rudeness slide. When he hit her, it hurt her feelings more than her body. \n\nWhen I married her, she was already a widow with three kids, each younger than the last. She married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love and ran away with him. She loved him deeply, but he got into gambling trouble and passed away. He used to hit her too.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The narrator reflects on his wife's proud past and current struggles, highlighting her resilience despite her hardships."
