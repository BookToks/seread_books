  "text": "Dounia felt a chill as she noticed the same unsettling look in Svidrigaïlov’s eyes that had scared her before. She glanced around, trying to hide her discomfort. But the fact that his place was so isolated hit her hard. She thought about asking if his landlady was home but held back, too proud to show her fear. Plus, she had bigger worries weighing on her heart.\n\n“Here’s your letter,” she said, dropping it on the table. “Is it true what you wrote? You’re implying my brother committed a crime. You’re being way too clear about it; you can’t backtrack now. I heard this ridiculous story before, and I don’t buy it. It’s disgusting and absurd. I know how this rumor started. You have no proof. You promised to show me proof. So, talk! But just know, I don’t believe you! I don’t believe you!”\n\nDounia rushed through her words, her face flushing with emotion.\n\n“If you didn’t believe it, why come here alone? Was it just curiosity?” Svidrigaïlov asked.\n\n“Stop messing with me. Just tell me!” she insisted.\n\n“You’ve got guts, I’ll give you that. Honestly, I thought you’d bring Mr. Razumihin with you. But you came solo, which shows you care about Rodion Romanovitch. That’s impressive… Now, about your brother, what should I say?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia confronts Svidrigaïlov about a letter suggesting her brother's involvement in a crime, expressing her disbelief and distress."
