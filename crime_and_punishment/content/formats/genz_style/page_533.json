  "text": "Katerina Ivanovna sometimes felt embarrassed. Sheâ€™d make up stories about new people she met and genuinely believe them. But then, out of nowhere, sheâ€™d be let down and would harshly reject the same person she had just adored. Katerina was usually cheerful and wanted everyone to be happy. But after so many letdowns, she craved peace and joy so much that even the tiniest disruption sent her into a frenzy. One moment sheâ€™d be dreaming big, and the next sheâ€™d be cursing her luck, even banging her head against the wall. ðŸ˜©\n\nAmalia Ivanovna suddenly became super important to Katerina. Katerina treated her with a lot of respect, probably because Amalia was all in on the preparations. She took charge of setting the table, providing the linens and dishes, and cooking in her kitchen. Katerina had left everything to her and went to the cemetery instead. Everything turned out well. The tablecloth was almost clean, and even though the dishes were mismatched (thanks to various lodgers), the table was set on time. Feeling proud of her work, Amalia dressed up in a black silk dress and a cap with fresh mourning ribbons to greet the returning group. But for some reason, Katerina didnâ€™t like her pride. ðŸ¤¨\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna's emotional instability leads her to oscillate between adoration and contempt for those around her, particularly Amalia Ivanovna, whose efforts she simultaneously respects and resents."
