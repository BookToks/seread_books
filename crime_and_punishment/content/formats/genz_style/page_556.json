Raskolnikov stayed quiet, his eyes locked on Sonia, sneaking glances at Luzhin. Sonia stood there, almost in a daze. She seemed too shocked to react. Suddenly, color flooded her face. She cried out and buried her face in her hands. \n\n“No, it wasn’t me! I didn’t take it! I don’t know anything about it!” she wailed, running to Katerina Ivanovna, who pulled her close, as if to shield her from the world.\n\n“Sonia! Sonia! I don’t believe it! I really don’t!” Katerina insisted, despite the obvious truth. She rocked Sonia back and forth like a child, showering her with kisses, then grabbing her hands to kiss them too. “You took it? These people are so stupid! You don’t know what a heart she has, what a girl she is! She’d sell her last piece of clothing, walk barefoot to help you if you needed it! She has that yellow passport because my kids were starving; she sold herself for us! Oh, husband, can you see this? What a dinner in your memory! Merciful heavens! Defend her! Why is everyone just standing there? Rodion Romanovitch, why aren’t you standing up for her? Do you believe it too? You’re not worth her little finger, all of you! Good God! At least defend her now!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia is unjustly accused of theft, prompting Katerina Ivanovna to passionately defend her character and plead for compassion from those around them."
