  "text": "A heavy horse-drawn cart rumbled by, and the driver yelled, “Hey there, German hatter!” He pointed right at the young man. The guy froze and nervously grabbed his hat. It was a tall, round hat from Zimmerman’s, but totally wrecked—old, torn, and bent on one side. Instead of feeling ashamed, he felt a wave of panic.\n\n“I knew it,” he muttered, confused. “This is the worst! A silly detail like this could ruin everything. My hat stands out too much. It looks ridiculous, and that makes it noticeable. I should be wearing a cap or anything old, but not this ridiculous thing. Nobody wears hats like this; it would catch attention from a mile away. People would remember it, and that could give them a clue. For what I’m planning, I need to blend in as much as possible. It’s all about the little things! Those little details always mess things up…”\n\nHe didn’t have far to go; he knew exactly how many steps it was from his lodging house gate—seven hundred and thirty. He had counted them once while daydreaming. Back then, he didn’t take those dreams seriously; they just teased him with their reckless thrill. But now, a month later, he saw them differently. Despite his inner monologues mocking his own hesitation, he had started to view this “hideous” dream as something he could actually attempt, even if he still felt uncertain.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The young man is consumed by anxiety over his conspicuous hat, fearing it could jeopardize his carefully planned actions."
