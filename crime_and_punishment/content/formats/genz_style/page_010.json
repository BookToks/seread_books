  "text": "Crime and Punishment 10\n\nA heavy horse cart rolled by, and someone shouted, “Hey, German hatter!” The young man froze and grabbed his hat nervously. It was a tall round hat from Zimmerman’s, but it was totally wrecked—old, torn, and bent awkwardly. Instead of feeling shame, he felt a wave of terror. \n\n“I knew it,” he mumbled, confused. “I thought so! This is the worst! A silly detail like this could mess up my whole plan. Yeah, my hat is way too noticeable… It looks ridiculous, which makes it stand out. With these rags, I should’ve worn a cap or something old, not this weird hat. No one wears something like this; it would be spotted from far away and remembered… That’s the problem! People remembering it gives them a clue. For this mission, I need to blend in as much as possible… It’s the little things that count! Those little things always ruin everything…”\n\nHe didn’t have far to go; he knew exactly how many steps it was from his lodging house gate: seven hundred and thirty. He had counted them once while lost in thought. Back then, he didn’t take those dreams seriously; they just teased him with their dark but bold ideas. Now, a month later, he was starting to see those dreams differently. Even with his inner monologues making fun of his own doubts, he couldn’t help but view this “hideous” dream as something he had to try, even though he still felt unsure.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The young man is consumed by anxiety over his conspicuous hat, fearing it could jeopardize his carefully planned actions."
