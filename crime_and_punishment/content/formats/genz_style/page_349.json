You kept talking about rings and chains in your delirium! It all makes sense now.” \n\n“Wow! How did that rumor spread?

He’s got manners, but he’s also skeptical and cynical. He loves to mess with people, or at least joke around with them. He’s thorough in his work, though. Last year, he solved a murder case when the police had almost nothing to go on.
