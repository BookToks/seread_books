You probably took something the wrong way and went too far,” Nikodim Fomitch said, turning to Raskolnikov with a friendly vibe. “But you were wrong; he’s a great guy, really! Just a bit explosive! He gets fired up, loses it, and then it’s all over. Deep down, he’s got a heart of gold! They called him the Explosive Lieutenant in the army…”\n\n“And what a wild army it was!” Ilya Petrovitch chimed in, enjoying the lighthearted banter, even though he was still a bit grumpy.\n\nRaskolnikov suddenly felt the urge to say something nice to everyone. “Hey, Captain,” he said casually, addressing Nikodim Fomitch, “can you see where I’m coming from? I’m ready to apologize if I came off rude. I’m just a broke student, totally worn out by poverty. I’m not even studying right now because I can’t afford it, but I’ll get money soon… My mom and sister are in the province of X. They’ll send me cash, and I’ll pay up. My landlady is nice, but she’s super frustrated that I haven’t paid her for the last four months, so she won’t even bring me dinner… And this I.O.U? I have no clue how to handle that. How am I supposed to pay her? You guys tell me!”\n\n“But that’s not really our problem, you know,” the head clerk pointed out.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, a struggling student, seeks understanding and forgiveness from others due to his dire financial situation and deteriorating circumstances."
