He just stood there, deep in thought.  \n\n“He checked out the flat,” the older workman said, stepping forward.  \n“Which flat?”  \n“The one we’re working on. He asked why we cleaned up the blood. ‘There was a murder here,’ he said, ‘and I’m here to take it.’ Then he started ringing the bell like he was about to break it. ‘Come to the police station,’ he said. ‘I’ll tell you everything there.’ He wouldn’t leave us alone.”  \n\nThe porter squinted at Raskolnikov, looking confused and annoyed.  \n“Who are you?” he shouted, trying to sound serious.  \n“I’m Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov. I used to be a student. I live in Shil’s house, flat number 14. Ask the porter; he knows me.” Raskolnikov spoke in a slow, dreamy way, not even turning around, just staring into the darkening street.  \n\n“Why did you go to the flat?”  \n“To check it out.”  \n“What’s there to see?”  \n“Take him straight to the police station,” the guy in the long coat interrupted sharply.  \n\nRaskolnikov glanced back over his shoulder and replied in the same lazy tone, “Come along.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov visits a flat where a murder occurred, prompting suspicion from the workmen and porter."
