When he visited Raskolnikov, he felt like a benefactor expecting praise for his good deeds. Now, as he walked downstairs, he felt unfairly slighted and unappreciated.\n\nDounia was everything to him; life without her was not an option. For years, he fantasized about marriage, waiting and saving up money. He secretly dreamed of a girl—she had to be poor, young, pretty, well-educated, and timid. He wanted someone who had suffered, someone who would see him as her savior, worship him, and admire only him. He imagined countless romantic scenarios once his work was done.\n\nNow, it seemed his dream was almost real. Avdotya Romanovna’s beauty and education caught his attention. Her vulnerable situation was a huge draw for him. She was more than he had hoped for—proud, strong, virtuous, and better educated than he was (he knew it). This girl would be forever grateful for his “heroic” kindness, humbling herself before him, giving him total control over her life. Just recently, after a lot of thinking, he had made a big decision in his plans.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pyotr Petrovitch's obsession with Dounia reveals his desire for control and admiration in a romantic relationship."
