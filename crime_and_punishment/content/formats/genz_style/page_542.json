  "text": "Katerina Ivanovna turned to Raskolnikov, saying, “But that's not true! He respected me a lot! He was a good guy! I felt bad for him sometimes. He’d just sit in the corner, and I wanted to be nice to him. But then I’d think, ‘If I’m nice, he’ll just start drinking again.’ You had to be tough to keep him in line.”\n\n“Yeah, he got his hair pulled a lot,” the clerk laughed, downing another shot of vodka.\n\n“Some people need a good smack, not just a hair pull! I’m not talking about my late husband!” Katerina snapped back, her cheeks flushing more and more. She was about to blow up. Some guests were giggling, clearly enjoying the chaos. They poked the clerk and whispered to him, trying to stir him up.\n\n“Can I ask what you’re talking about?” the clerk started, confused. “Who are you even referring to? But whatever, I don’t care! That’s dumb! Widow! I forgive you... Whatever!” He took another drink.\n\nRaskolnikov sat quietly, feeling disgusted. He only ate to be polite, just nibbling on the food Katerina kept piling on his plate to spare her feelings. He focused on Sonia, but she seemed lost in her own thoughts.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna expresses her conflicted feelings about her late husband, revealing her struggle between kindness and the need for severity to manage his behavior."
