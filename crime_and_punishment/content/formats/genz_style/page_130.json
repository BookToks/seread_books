He noticed the lack of people around and freaked out a bit—being so visible made him uneasy. Even though he was exhausted, he took a long detour to get home from a different route.\n\nHe barely registered anything when he got to his building. He was already on the stairs before he remembered the axe. He had a serious issue to deal with: putting it back without getting caught. It didn’t even cross his mind that he could just ditch it later in someone’s yard. \n\nLuck was on his side—the porter’s door was closed but not locked, which meant the guy was probably home. But he was so out of it that he just walked right up and opened the door. If the porter had asked, “What’s up?” he might’ve handed him the axe without thinking! But the porter wasn’t there, so he managed to stash the axe back under the bench and covered it with a piece of wood like before. \n\nHe didn’t run into anyone on his way to his room; the landlady’s door was shut too. Once inside, he collapsed onto the sofa, not really sleeping but drifting into a blank state.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist, overwhelmed and fatigued, struggles to conceal an axe after a troubling incident while navigating his way home."
