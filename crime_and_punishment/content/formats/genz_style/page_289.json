I’m a total mess, unworthy of you, and honestly, I’m ashamed. I’m not good enough to love you, but every decent guy should show respect, and I’ve done that. Here are your lodgings, and Rodya was right to kick your Pyotr Petrovitch to the curb. How could he put you in a place like this? It’s ridiculous! Do you know who stays here? And you’re his fiancée? Seriously? Well, I’ll be real with you: your fiancé is a jerk.”  \n\n“Excuse me, Mr. Razumihin, you’re forgetting…” Pulcheria Alexandrovna started.  \n“Yes, yes, you’re right. I lost my cool, and I’m sorry,” Razumihin quickly apologized. “But you can’t be mad at me for saying this! I’m being honest, not because… um, well, that would be embarrassing. Not because I’m in… um!
