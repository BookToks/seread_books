Finally, she spoke up, her voice steady, “Nobody has been beating the landlady.” \n\nHe looked at her, struggling to catch his breath. “I heard it myself… I wasn’t asleep. I was sitting up,” he said, his voice shaky. “I listened for a long time. The assistant superintendent came… Everyone rushed out onto the stairs.”\n\n“No one has been here. That’s just the blood ringing in your ears. When it gets stuck and can’t flow, your mind starts playing tricks,” she replied. “Do you want something to eat?”\n\nHe didn’t respond. Nastasya kept watching him. \n\n“Please, give me something to drink… Nastasya.” \n\nShe went downstairs and came back with a white jug of water. He only remembered taking one sip and spilling some on his neck before everything faded away.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, in a feverish state, struggles with hallucinations and confusion about a supposed incident involving blood and the landlady."
