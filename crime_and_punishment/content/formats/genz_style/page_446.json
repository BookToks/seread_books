He asked the porter for directions to Kapernaumov, the tailor, but got only vague hints. After searching a bit, he found the dark, narrow staircase and climbed to the second floor. Once there, he stepped out onto a gallery that wrapped around the entire floor, looking for Kapernaumov’s door in the dim light. \n\nSuddenly, a door opened nearby, and he instinctively reached for it. \n\n“Who’s there?” a woman’s voice asked, sounding uneasy. \n\n“It’s me… here to see you,” Raskolnikov replied as he walked into the tiny entryway. \n\nA candle flickered on a broken chair in a battered copper candlestick. \n\n“It’s you! Good heavens!” Sonia exclaimed weakly, frozen in shock. \n\n“Which is your room? This way?” Raskolnikov asked, avoiding her gaze as he hurried inside. \n\nA minute later, Sonia followed him in, holding the candle. She set it down and stood there, visibly shaken and clearly startled by his unexpected visit. Color rushed to her cheeks.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov visits Sonia at her home, finding her surprised and agitated by his unexpected arrival."
