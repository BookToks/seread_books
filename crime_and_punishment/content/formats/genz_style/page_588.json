  "text": "I committed murder again. But I was searching for something deeper. I needed to know if I was just a nobody like everyone else or if I was actually someone. Could I break the rules? Could I dare to pick up what others wouldn't? Was I weak, or did I have the right… \n\n‘To kill? You think you have the right to kill?’ Sonia gasped, hands clasped. \n\n‘Oh, Sonia!’ he snapped, ready to say something back but then just fell silent. ‘Don’t interrupt me. I need to prove one thing: the devil led me to this. He showed me I had no right to take that path because I’m just as much of a nobody as everyone else. He was mocking me, and now I’m here with you! Welcome your guest! If I weren’t a nobody, would I even come to you? Listen, when I went to that old woman, I was just trying… I swear!’\n\n‘And you killed her!’\n\n‘But how did I kill her? Is that how people commit murder? Do they just go to do it like I did? I’ll tell you someday how it happened! Did I really kill that old woman? I killed myself, not her! I crushed myself completely… But it was the devil who killed her, not me. Enough, Sonia, enough! Just let me be!’ He cried out in pain, leaning forward, head in his hands.\n\n‘What suffering!’ Sonia cried out, heartbroken.\n\n‘So, what am I supposed to do now?’ He suddenly lifted his head, his face twisted in agony.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist grapples with the moral implications of his actions, feeling that he has not only killed another but has also destroyed himself in the process."
