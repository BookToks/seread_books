  "text": "Lebeziatnikov looked really stressed. \n\n“I came to see you, Sofya Semyonovna,” he started. “Sorry… I thought you’d be here,” he said, suddenly turning to Raskolnikov. “Not that I meant anything weird… But I just thought… Katerina Ivanovna has lost it,” he blurted out, shifting back to Sonia.\n\nSonia gasped. \n\n“It seems that way. But we’re at a loss about what to do! She came back—she looks like she’s been through hell, maybe even beaten. She ran off to your dad’s old boss but he wasn’t home—he was at some dinner with another general. Can you believe it? She went to that other general’s place and was so determined that she got the boss to meet her, pulling him away from dinner. You can guess how that went. She got kicked out, obviously. According to her, she yelled at him and even threw something at him. I can’t believe she wasn’t arrested! Now she’s telling everyone, including Amalia Ivanovna, but it’s hard to follow her; she’s screaming and throwing a fit. Oh, and she’s saying that since everyone has ditched her, she’ll take the kids and hit the streets with a barrel-organ.” 🎪\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna is in a state of distress, having been turned away from a general's dinner and threatening to take her children to the streets."
