  "text": "Razumihin woke up the next morning feeling heavy and serious. He was hit with a bunch of unexpected thoughts. He never thought he'd wake up feeling like this. The memories of yesterday were fresh in his mind, and he realized he had experienced something totally new. It was a vibe he hadn’t felt before. \n\nBut then he thought about how low he had sunk. Getting drunk was a lame excuse; it just made everything worse. The truth had come out, and it revealed the ugly side of his jealous heart. Could he really dream of being with someone like her? He, the loud, drunken fool from last night? The idea felt absurd and made him blush with embarrassment. \n\nHe suddenly remembered how he joked about the landlady being jealous of Avdotya Romanovna. That was just too much. He slammed his fist down on the kitchen stove, hurt his hand, and knocked a brick loose. \n\n“Of course,” he muttered, feeling ashamed. “All these mistakes can’t be erased. It’s pointless to even think about it. I just need to go to them quietly and do what I have to do… without asking for forgiveness or saying a word. Everything’s ruined now!” \n\nStill, as he got dressed, he paid extra attention to his clothes. He only had this one suit, and if he had another, he wouldn’t even wear it. “I wouldn’t want to put it on anyway.” But he couldn’t just be a cynical mess. He had to respect others, especially when they needed his help. He brushed off his clothes carefully. His linen was always decent; he made sure of that.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin grapples with feelings of shame and self-abasement after a night of drunkenness, reflecting on his behavior and the impact it has on his relationships."
