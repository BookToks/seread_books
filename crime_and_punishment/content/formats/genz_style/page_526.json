  "text": "“Crime and Punishment” \n\nSo, your late parent didn’t finish their term and wasn’t really in the service lately. If there’s any hope, it’s pretty slim since there’s no claim for help—definitely not. And she’s dreaming of a pension already, ha! What a character!\n\n“Yeah, she is. She’s naive and kind-hearted, believes everything because she wants to see the good in people. You’ve got to excuse her,” Sonia said, standing up again to leave.\n\n“But you haven’t heard what I need to say.”\n\n“No, I haven’t,” Sonia mumbled.\n\n“Then sit down.” She was super flustered and sat back down for the third time.\n\n“Considering her situation with her little ones, I’d really like to help, as much as I can. Maybe we could set up a fundraiser or a lottery, something like that. Friends or even strangers often do this for those in need. That’s what I wanted to discuss with you; it could actually happen.”\n\n“Yeah, yeah… God will reward you for this,” Sonia said, looking closely at Pyotr Petrovitch.\n\n“It’s possible, but we’ll talk about it later. We could start today, go over the details this evening, and lay the groundwork, so to speak. Come see me at seven. Mr. Lebeziatnikov should help us out. But there's something I need to warn you about first…”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sonia expresses her confusion and concern about her family's financial situation while discussing potential assistance with Pyotr Petrovitch."
