But I’m pretty sure I’m stronger than you,” I replied. “I didn’t ask if you think ghosts are seen; I asked if you think they exist.”\n\n“No way!” Raskolnikov snapped, clearly annoyed.\n\n“What do people usually say?” Svidrigaïlov muttered, looking down and lost in thought. “They say, ‘You’re sick, so what you see is just your imagination.’ But that doesn’t make sense. Sure, ghosts might show up for the sick, but that just means they can only appear to them, not that they don’t exist.”\n\n“Not true,” Raskolnikov shot back, irritated.\n\n“Really? You don’t think so?” Svidrigaïlov pressed, staring at him. “How about this argument: ghosts are like pieces of other worlds, the start of them. A healthy person has no reason to see them because they’re focused on this life. But when someone gets sick, their normal view of the world shifts. The worse the illness, the more they sense that there’s something beyond.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov argues that ghosts may only appear to the sick, suggesting they are fragments of another world, while Raskolnikov vehemently denies their existence."
