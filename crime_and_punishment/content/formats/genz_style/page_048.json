  "text": "Rodya wanted some alone time with the letter, so he asked Nastasya to leave. Once she was gone, he quickly kissed the envelope, then stared at the familiar handwriting on it. It was from his mom, who had taught him to read and write. He hesitated, almost scared to open it. Finally, he did. The letter was thick—over two ounces—and filled with tiny writing on two large sheets.\n\n“Dear Rodya,” his mom wrote. “It’s been two months since I last heard from you, and it’s been stressing me out, keeping me up at night. But I know you won’t blame me for not writing sooner. You know how much I love you; you and Dounia are everything to me, my only hope. I was heartbroken to learn you dropped out of university because you couldn’t afford it and lost your lessons and work! How could I help you with my tiny pension of one hundred twenty roubles a year? \n\nThe fifteen roubles I sent you four months ago? I borrowed that money from Vassily Ivanovitch Vahrushin, a kind merchant friend of your father. I had to let him take my pension payments until I paid off the debt, which I just finished. Now, thank God, I think I can send you some more money. We might actually have some good luck coming our way! 🎉\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Rodya's mother expresses her deep concern for him and their family's struggles while conveying hope for better times ahead."
