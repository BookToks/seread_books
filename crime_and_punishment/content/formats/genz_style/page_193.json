  "text": "**Chapter IV**\n\nZossimov was a tall, chubby guy with a pale, clean-shaven face and straight, light hair. He sported glasses and a big gold ring on his finger. At twenty-seven, he was dressed in a trendy, loose grey coat and light summer pants. Everything about him was stylish and neat. His clothes were fresh, and he wore a hefty watch chain. His vibe was slow and chill, but he tried hard to act casual. Still, his self-importance peeked through all the time. People found him boring, but they acknowledged he was good at his job.\n\n“I came to check on you twice today, bro. He’s waking up!” Razumihin said excitedly.\n\n“I see, I see. How are we feeling now, huh?” Zossimov asked Raskolnikov, keeping a close eye on him as he sat at the foot of the sofa, trying to get comfy.\n\n“He's still feeling down,” Razumihin continued. “We just changed his sheets, and he almost cried.”\n\n“That makes sense; you could’ve waited if he wasn’t up for it. His pulse is solid. Still got a headache?” Zossimov asked.\n\n“I’m fine, totally fine!” Raskolnikov snapped back, sitting up on the sofa.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Zossimov, a doctor, observes Raskolnikov's recovery while noting his continued depression and irritability."
