  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nDostoevsky had epilepsy, which he dealt with for life. He’d have seizures three or four times a year, especially when stressed. In 1859, he got back to Russia and started a journal called ‘Vremya,’ but it got banned due to a misunderstanding. \n\nIn 1864, he faced huge losses—his first wife and brother Mihail passed away. He was super broke but still took on his brother’s debts. Then he launched another journal, ‘The Epoch,’ but that got shut down too. He was drowning in debt, his brother’s family relied on him, and he had to write like crazy. Rumor has it, he never even corrected his work! Thankfully, his second wife brought him some comfort in his later years.\n\nIn June 1880, he gave a legendary speech at the unveiling of Pushkin’s monument in Moscow, and people showered him with love and respect. A few months later, he passed away, and a massive crowd showed up for his funeral, treating him like royalty. Even now, he’s one of the most read authors in Russia.\n\nA Russian critic summed it up well: “He was one of us, but he suffered and saw life more deeply than most. His insights feel like wisdom we all crave to learn from.” That wisdom? He earned it through his struggles.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dostoevsky faced personal tragedies and poverty throughout his life, yet his profound insights and literary contributions earned him enduring admiration in Russia."
