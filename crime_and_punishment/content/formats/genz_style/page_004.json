  "text": "Dostoevsky had epilepsy, which haunted him for life. He’d have seizures three or four times a year, especially when stressed. In 1859, he got to go back to Russia. He launched a journal called ‘Vremya,’ but it got banned due to a mix-up with the Censorship. \n\nIn 1864, he faced huge losses—his first wife and his brother Mihail both passed away. He was broke but still took on his brother’s debts. He tried again with another journal, ‘The Epoch,’ but that one got shut down too. Burdened by debt and with his brother’s family relying on him, he had to write like crazy and reportedly didn’t even edit his work. Luckily, his second wife brought him some comfort and love in his later years.\n\nIn June 1880, he gave a powerful speech at the unveiling of a Pushkin monument in Moscow, and the crowd showed him tons of love and respect. A few months later, he passed away. A huge crowd turned out for his funeral, giving him a send-off fit for a king. He’s still one of the most read authors in Russia.\n\nA Russian critic summed it up well: “He was one of us, a person who suffered and saw life more deeply than most. His insights feel like wisdom that we crave to learn how to live better.” All his other talents came naturally, but this wisdom? He earned that through his struggles.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dostoevsky faced immense personal and financial struggles throughout his life, yet he remained a deeply influential and beloved figure in Russian literature."
