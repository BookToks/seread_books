  "text": "Dostoevsky had epilepsy, which he dealt with for life. He’d have fits three or four times a year, especially during high-stress moments. In 1859, he was finally allowed to go back to Russia. He launched a journal called ‘Vremya,’ but it got banned due to a misunderstanding with the Censorship. \n\nIn 1864, he faced huge losses with the death of his first wife and his brother Mihail. Despite being broke, he took on his brother’s debts. He tried again with another journal, ‘The Epoch,’ but that one was banned too within months. Burdened by debt and the responsibility of supporting his brother’s family, he had to write at a crazy pace and, reportedly, never edited his work. Luckily, his second wife brought him some comfort and support in his later years.\n\nIn June 1880, he gave a powerful speech at the unveiling of a Pushkin monument in Moscow. The crowd showed him tons of love and respect. A few months later, Dostoevsky passed away. His funeral drew a massive crowd of mourners who honored him like royalty. Today, he’s still one of the most-read authors in Russia.\n\nA Russian critic summed up his impact: “He was one of us, but he suffered and understood life on a deeper level. His insights feel like wisdom we all crave to learn how to live better. While his other talents were natural, this wisdom was earned through his struggles.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dostoevsky faced immense personal and financial struggles throughout his life, yet his profound insights and literary contributions earned him enduring admiration in Russia."
