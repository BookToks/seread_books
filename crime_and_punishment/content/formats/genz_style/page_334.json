  "text": "Crime and Punishment\n\nHe’s writing about some shady behavior (I met this guy last night for the first time) — but it’s aimed at the widow. To me, it looks like he’s rushing to slander me and stir up trouble between us. He uses all this legal mumbo jumbo, showing his intentions way too clearly, and he seems way too eager. Sure, he’s smart, but being smart isn’t enough to act wisely. It all reveals his character, and honestly, I don’t think he respects you much. I’m telling you this because I genuinely want what’s best for you. \n\nDounia stayed quiet. She had made her choice. Now, she was just waiting for the evening.\n\n“What's your decision, Rodya?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked, clearly more anxious than ever about his sudden serious tone.\n\n“What decision?”\n\n“Pyotr Petrovitch says you can’t be with us tonight, and he’ll leave if you show up. So, are you… coming?”\n\n“Well, that’s not really up to me. It’s more about what you decide first, if you’re okay with that request; and second, what Dounia thinks, if she’s cool with it too. I’ll do whatever you think is best,” he replied, sounding a bit distant.\n\n“Dounia’s already made her choice, and I completely agree with her,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna quickly said.\n\n“I’m asking you, Rodya, to really make an effort to be with us for this meeting,” Dounia urged. “Will you come?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“I’m also inviting Razumihin to join us at eight,” she added, looking at him. “Mom, I’m inviting him too.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia is determined to confront Pyotr Petrovitch and wants Rodya and Razumihin to support her during the meeting."
