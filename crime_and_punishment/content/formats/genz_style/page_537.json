Not a great start for the gathering. Eventually, everyone settled in.\n\nRaskolnikov showed up just as they got back from the cemetery. Katerina was super happy to see him. He was the only “smart” guest around and was set to be a professor in two years. Plus, he apologized for missing the funeral, which made her even more excited. She practically dragged him to sit on her left side (Amalia was on her right). \n\nEven with her constant worry about the food being served right and her bad cough getting worse, Katerina leaned in to whisper her frustrations to Raskolnikov. She was venting about the dinner disaster and couldn’t help but laugh at her guests, especially at her landlady.\n\n“It’s all that cuckoo’s fault! You know who I mean?
