  "text": "Raskolnikov felt this vibe right away, even before anyone said anything. The guy sitting a bit away looked like an old clerk, and Raskolnikov couldn't shake off that first impression. He kept glancing at the clerk, who was staring back at him, clearly wanting to chat. \n\nThe clerk seemed bored with the other folks in the room, including the tavern-keeper. He acted like he was above them, thinking they were too low-key for him to bother with. This dude was over fifty, bald, and kinda chunky. His face was puffy from drinking too much, with a yellowish-green tint and swollen eyelids. His sharp, red eyes peeked out like little slits. \n\nBut there was something off about him. His eyes had this intense spark, like he felt deeply—maybe he was smart, but there was also a hint of madness in there. He wore an old, ragged black coat with almost all the buttons missing, except for one that he clung to, trying to hold on to some respectability. His shirt was wrinkled and stained, sticking out from his canvas vest. \n\nHe didn’t sport a beard or mustache like a typical clerk, but he hadn’t shaved in ages, so his chin looked like a rough, gray brush. Still, he had this official vibe about him. But he was restless, fidgeting a lot.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is struck by the peculiar presence of a retired clerk in a tavern, who exudes a mix of intelligence and madness despite his disheveled appearance."
