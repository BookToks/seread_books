  "text": "Raskolnikov felt an instant vibe from the guy sitting a bit away from him. This dude looked like a retired clerk. Raskolnikov couldn’t shake the feeling, even later, that it was some kind of gut feeling. He kept glancing at the clerk, who was staring back, clearly wanting to chat.\n\nThe clerk seemed bored with everyone else in the room, including the tavern-keeper. He acted like he was above them, judging them as beneath his level of sophistication. He was over fifty, bald, and a bit stout. His face was puffy from drinking too much, with a yellowish-green tint and swollen eyelids. His sharp, reddish eyes peeked out like slits.\n\nBut there was something off about him. His eyes had a spark, like he felt deeply—maybe he had some smarts, but there was also a hint of madness. He wore a ragged black coat with only one button left, which he had fastened, holding onto that last bit of dignity. His shirt was crumpled and stained, sticking out from his worn waistcoat. He didn’t have a beard or mustache, but he hadn’t shaved in so long that his chin looked like a rough, gray brush. \n\nDespite his shabby appearance, he carried himself with a sort of official air. But he was restless, fidgeting around.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is intrigued by a peculiar retired clerk in a tavern, who exudes a mix of intelligence and madness despite his disheveled appearance."
