  "text": "Raskolnikov felt a weird vibe from the guy sitting a bit away from him. This dude looked like a retired clerk and gave off a strong impression right from the start. Raskolnikov couldn’t shake it off later, even thinking of it as a sort of sixth sense. He kept glancing at the clerk, who was staring back, clearly wanting to chat.\n\nThe clerk seemed over the other people in the room, including the tavern keeper. He looked down on them, like they were beneath him in terms of status and culture. He was a stout guy, over fifty, with a bald head and graying hair. His face was bloated from drinking, with a yellowish-green tint and swollen eyelids. But his eyes? They were sharp and red, like they could see right through you. There was something off about him—something intense, maybe even a bit crazy.\n\nHe wore a ragged black coat, missing all but one button, which he clung to like it was his last piece of dignity. His shirt front was crumpled and stained, sticking out from his canvas waistcoat. He didn’t have a beard or mustache, but he hadn’t shaved in so long that his chin looked like a rough, gray brush. Despite his scruffy appearance, he carried himself with an air of respectability. But he was restless, fidgeting a lot.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is struck by the peculiar presence of a retired clerk in a tavern, whose appearance and demeanor evoke a mix of contempt and intrigue."
