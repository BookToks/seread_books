  "text": "Svidrigaïlov said, \"So, Marfa Petrovna let me have some freedom with the maids, but only because she knew about it. She made it clear that I shouldn’t fall for a woman from our social class. And if I ever did fall hard, I had to tell her. But honestly, she didn’t worry too much about that. She saw me as a guy who couldn’t really love, just a party boy. \n\nBut there’s a big difference between being sensible and being jealous, and that’s where things got tricky. To really judge people, we need to drop our biases and usual views of the world around us. I trust your judgment more than anyone else's. \n\nYou've probably heard some wild stories about Marfa Petrovna. Sure, she had her quirks, but I genuinely feel bad for the mess I caused her. That’s enough of a respectful eulogy for a devoted wife. When we fought, I usually kept quiet, which helped smooth things over. That gentlemanly approach often worked; it made her proud of me. \n\nBut your sister? Marfa couldn’t stand her. I still can’t believe she brought such a stunning girl into her home as a governess. My guess? Marfa Petrovna was passionate and easily swayed—she literally fell for your sister.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marfa Petrovna, despite her sensible nature, was deeply affected by jealousy and love, particularly towards Avdotya Romanovna, complicating her relationship with Svidrigaïlov."
