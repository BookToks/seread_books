  "text": "Andrey Semyonovitch had been chilling at home all morning. Pyotr Petrovitch’s vibe toward him was weird but kinda understandable. He had totally dissed and hated Andrey since the day he showed up, but he also felt a bit intimidated. Andrey didn’t crash at his place just to save cash, even though that was a big part of it. He knew Andrey was a big deal—a leading young progressive making waves in some intriguing circles that everyone in the provinces talked about. \n\nThis reputation freaked Pyotr out. Those powerful circles, always judging and exposing people, gave him a vague sense of dread. He didn’t really get what they were about, but he had heard enough to know they existed—especially in Petersburg. Terms like “progressives” and “nihilists” were thrown around, and he took them way too seriously, blowing them out of proportion. \n\nWhat he feared most was being exposed, and that fear made him anxious about moving his business to Petersburg. It was like the fear little kids have when they think they’ll get in trouble. A few years back, when he was just starting out, he saw two big shots in his province get publicly humiliated. One situation ended in major scandal for them. 😬\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pyotr Petrovitch feels a mix of disdain and fear towards Andrey Semyonovitch, a progressive figure he perceives as a threat to his reputation."
