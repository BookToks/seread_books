  "text": "Zametov is just a kid. I could mess with his hair, but you gotta draw him in, not push him away. You can’t change someone by shutting them out, especially a young guy. Seriously, you all need to wake up! Running someone down only hurts you in the end. But hey, if you want to know, we actually have something in common.\n\n“What’s that?” \n\nIt’s about a house painter. We’re helping him out of a tough spot! But honestly, there’s nothing to worry about now. It’s all pretty clear. We just need to keep the pressure on. \n\n“A painter?” \n\nHaven’t I mentioned this? I only told you the start about the old pawnbroker lady getting murdered. Well, the painter is involved in that… \n\n“Oh, I heard about that murder before. I was kinda interested for a reason… I read about it in the papers.” \n\n“Lizaveta was murdered too,” Nastasya suddenly said, looking straight at Raskolnikov. She had been in the room the whole time, listening by the door. \n\n“Lizaveta,” Raskolnikov murmured, almost too quietly to hear. \n\n“Lizaveta, the one who sold old clothes. Didn’t you know her? She used to come here. She even mended a shirt for you.” \n\nRaskolnikov turned to the wall, where he spotted a clumsy white flower with brown lines on the dirty yellow paper. He started counting the petals and checking out the scallops on them.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The conversation reveals a connection between a house-painter and a murder case involving an old pawnbroker and another victim, Lizaveta."
