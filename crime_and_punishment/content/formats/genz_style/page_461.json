  "text": "Sonia felt uneasy about Raskolnikov’s request and slowly moved to the table. She picked up the book. \n\n“Haven’t you read it?” she asked, glancing at him from across the table. \n\nHer tone got sharper. \n\n“Long ago... when I was in school. Just read!” \n\n“And haven’t you heard it in church?” \n\n“I... haven’t been. Do you go often?” \n\n“N-no,” Sonia whispered. \n\nRaskolnikov smiled. \n\n“I get it... So you’re going to your dad’s funeral tomorrow?” \n\n“Yes, I will. I was at church last week too... I had a requiem service.” \n\n“For who?” \n\n“For Lizaveta. She was killed with an axe.” \n\nHis nerves were fraying. His head started spinning. \n\n“Were you close with Lizaveta?” \n\n“Yes... She was kind... She would come by sometimes, but not often... She couldn’t. We read together and talked. She will see God.” \n\nThat last part sounded odd to him. And now he learned about her secret meetups with Lizaveta—both of them religiously obsessed. \n\n“I’m going to be a religious maniac soon! It’s contagious!” \n\n“Read!” he snapped, feeling impatient. \n\nSonia hesitated. Her heart raced. She barely dared to read to him. He looked almost frustrated.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov urges Sonia to read from the New Testament, revealing their shared connection to faith and loss."
