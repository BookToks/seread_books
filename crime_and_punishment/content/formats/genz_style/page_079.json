  "text": "Raskolnikov looked down on everyone, acting like he was smarter and better than them. He thought their beliefs and interests were beneath him. \n\nWith Razumihin, though, it was different. Raskolnikov was more open and relaxed. It was hard not to be with Razumihin—he was super friendly and honest, almost to a fault. There was a lot of depth behind his simple vibe. The people who really knew him appreciated this, and everyone liked him. \n\nHe was smart, but he could also be a bit of a goof sometimes. Razumihin stood out—tall, thin, and black-haired, but always a bit scruffy. He had a wild side, too; once, he knocked a huge cop down with one punch during a night out. He could drink a lot but also knew how to stay sober. Sometimes his jokes went too far, but he could easily chill without them. \n\nWhat really set Razumihin apart was his resilience. No setback seemed to get him down. He could crash anywhere and tough it out through freezing cold and hunger. He was broke but always found ways to make money. He once spent an entire winter without turning on his heater, claiming he slept better in the cold. For now, he was just getting by.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels superior to his peers, yet finds a more genuine connection with the good-natured and resilient Razumihin."
