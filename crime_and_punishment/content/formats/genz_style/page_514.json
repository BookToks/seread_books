  "text": "Pyotr Petrovitch was all about himself. He loved hearing how great he was, even if it meant accepting some pretty questionable virtues. \n\nThat morning, he had just cashed in some five-percent bonds and was now at the table, counting stacks of cash. Andrey Semyonovitch, who rarely had any money, wandered around the room, pretending to be indifferent to the bills, even acting like they were beneath him. But Pyotr Petrovitch was convinced that Andrey was secretly jealous and was probably enjoying the chance to remind him of how much richer he was.\n\nAndrey noticed that Pyotr seemed super distracted and irritable. Still, he launched into his favorite topic: starting a new special \"commune\" (a community with shared goals). Pyotr’s half-hearted comments, mixed with the sound of beads clicking on his counting frame, dripped with sarcasm. But Andrey, ever the optimist, thought Pyotr’s bad mood was due to his recent breakup with Dounia. He was eager to talk about it, convinced he had some progressive ideas that would cheer up his friend and help him grow.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Andrey Semyonovitch struggles with feelings of inferiority and irritation while discussing progressive ideas with the self-absorbed Pyotr Petrovitch."
