  "text": "When it comes to crime, he couldn't decide if it came from a sick mind or if the act itself was like a disease. He thought that, in his case, he wouldnâ€™t have any weird reactions. His reasoning and willpower would stay strong because he believed his plan wasnâ€™t really a crime. (Spoiler: it totally is.) \n\nWe wonâ€™t dive into how he reached that conclusion; weâ€™ve already gone too far. Just know that the practical stuff didnâ€™t weigh heavily on him. He figured if he kept his focus, he could handle it all. But hereâ€™s the kicker: he never really started preparing. His final decisions? He trusted them the least. When the moment came, everything went down differently than he expected.\n\nOne tiny detail messed up his plans before he even left the stairs. As he reached the landladyâ€™s kitchen, he peeked inside to check if Nastasya was gone and if the landladyâ€™s door was shut, so she wouldnâ€™t see him grab the axe. But surprise! Nastasya was there, hanging laundry. When she spotted him, she stopped what she was doing and just stared. ðŸ˜³\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The protagonist grapples with the moral implications of his planned crime, believing his reasoning will remain intact, but is ultimately thrown off by an unexpected encounter."
