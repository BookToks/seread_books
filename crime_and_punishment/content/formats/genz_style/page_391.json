It was late evening. Twilight had settled in, and the full moon was shining bright. But the air felt heavy. The streets were crowded; workers and business folks were heading home, while others were out for a stroll. The smell of dust, mortar, and stagnant water filled the air. \n\nRaskolnikov walked, feeling sad and anxious. He knew he had a purpose, something urgent to do, but he couldn’t remember what it was. Suddenly, he stopped. Across the street, a man was waving him over. He crossed to him, but the man turned and walked away, head down, like he hadn’t even signaled. “Wait, did he really wave at me?” Raskolnikov thought, trying to catch up.

Raskolnikov followed him.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov grapples with his guilt and confusion after committing murder, reflecting on the women he has harmed and feeling a sense of urgency despite forgetting his purpose."
