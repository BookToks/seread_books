  "text": "Raskolnikov had a wild dream. He found himself as a kid again, around seven years old, walking in the countryside with his dad on a holiday evening. It was a gloomy day, but everything felt super real in his dream—way more than he remembered. \n\nThe little town was flat and bare, not even a willow tree in sight. In the distance, there was a dark patch of trees on the horizon. Just past the last market garden stood a big tavern, which always made him feel uneasy, even scared, when he walked by with his dad. It was always packed with noise—shouting, laughter, and fights. The people hanging around looked rough and drunk. He would cling to his dad, shaking with fear whenever they passed them.\n\nThe road near the tavern turned into a dusty path, always black with dirt. It twisted around, and about a hundred steps ahead, it veered right toward the graveyard. In the middle of the graveyard was a stone church with a green dome. He used to go there for mass a couple of times a year with his parents for services in memory of his grandmother, who he never met. They’d bring a special rice pudding with raisins shaped like a cross, wrapped in a napkin. He loved that church, with its simple icons and the old priest with a shaky head.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov dreams of his childhood, recalling a fearful visit to a tavern and a graveyard with his father."
