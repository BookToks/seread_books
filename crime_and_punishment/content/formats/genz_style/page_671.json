Plus, they have two little nephews to look after, like their own kids aren’t enough. They even pulled their youngest daughter, who’s about to turn sixteen, out of school so she can get married. She was meant for me. So, we went there. \n\nIt was hilarious! Here I am—a landowner, a widower, with a decent name and some cash. Sure, I’m fifty and she’s not even sixteen, but who cares? It’s wild, right? You should’ve seen me chatting with her parents. It was a sight to behold! Then she walks in, curtsies, and you can picture it—still in a short dress, like an unopened flower! Blushing like a sunset—she must’ve been told to expect me. \n\nI don’t know what you think about young girls, but to me, those innocent eyes, the shyness, and even the tears are more charming than just looks. She’s a total cutie, too. With curly, fair hair like a lamb, rosy little lips, and tiny feet—adorable! We hit it off right away. I told them I was in a rush because of personal stuff, and the next day—yep, just two days ago—we got engaged. Now, when I visit, I scoop her up onto my lap right away. She blushes like crazy, and I can’t stop kissing her. Her mom makes sure she knows I’m her husband now, and that’s how it is. It’s just delightful! Honestly, being engaged might even be better than actually getting married.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The narrator describes his engagement to a much younger girl, finding the experience of betrothal more delightful than marriage itself."
