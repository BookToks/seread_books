  "text": "Dounia, what you're considering is way worse than Sonia's situation. For her, it’s about survival, but for you, it’s just a trade for luxuries. This comes with a price, and what if you can’t handle it later? The regret, the pain, the hidden tears—you're not like Marfa Petrovna. Think about how your mom will feel. She's already anxious, but what happens when she sees everything clearly? \n\nAnd me? What do you think I want? I don’t want you to sacrifice yourself, Dounia. I won’t let it happen as long as I’m alive! \n\nBut wait—how are you going to stop it? You’ll just say no? What right do you have? What can you promise them that gives you that right? You plan to devote your whole life to them after you finish school and get a job? We’ve heard that all before. But right now, you’re living off them. They’re borrowing money from their pension and from the Svidrigaïlovs. How will you save them from those people, or from Afanasy Ivanovitch Vahrushin, this future millionaire who wants to control their lives? \n\nIn ten years, what will happen? Mom could be blind from knitting too much or from crying. She’ll be exhausted from fasting. And your sister? Just imagine what could happen to her.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia's potential sacrifice for her family's well-being is questioned, highlighting the moral and emotional burdens of such decisions."
