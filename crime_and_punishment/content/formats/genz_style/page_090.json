She collapsed like a log. \n\n“Finish her off!” Mikolka yelled, jumping out of the cart. A group of young guys, also drunk, grabbed whatever they could—whips, sticks, poles—and rushed over to the dying mare. Mikolka stood back and started swinging the crowbar wildly. The mare stretched her neck, took a deep breath, and then died. \n\n“You butchered her!” someone in the crowd shouted. \n\n“Why wouldn’t she run?” another voice called out. \n\n“It’s my property!” Mikolka yelled, his eyes bloodshot, swinging the bar like he wished he had more to hit her with. \n\n“No question, you’re not a Christian,” voices echoed around him. \n\nMeanwhile, a poor boy, frantic, pushed through the crowd to the mare. He wrapped his arms around her bloody head and kissed it—her eyes, her lips. Then he jumped up, fists flying at Mikolka. Just then, his father, who had been chasing after him, scooped him up and carried him away from the chaos. \n\n“Come on, let’s go home,” he said. \n\n“Father! Why did they… kill the poor horse?” he sobbed, his voice breaking into shrieks as he gasped for air. 🐴💔\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Mikolka brutally beats a mare to death while a horrified crowd looks on, prompting a young boy to mourn the animal's suffering."
