  "text": "**Chapter IV**\n\nRaskolnikov was all in for Sonia, defending her against Luzhin, even though he was carrying his own heavy load of horror and pain. After everything that went down that morning, he needed a change of pace, plus he genuinely wanted to protect Sonia. But he was also super anxious about telling her who killed Lizaveta. He knew it would hurt him deeply, so he tried to push that thought away.\n\nAs he left Katerina Ivanovna’s, he shouted, “Well, Sofya Semyonovna, we’ll see what you’ll say now!” He felt pumped and ready to take on the world after beating Luzhin. But by the time he got to Sonia’s place, everything changed. He suddenly felt weak and scared. He froze at the door, wondering, “Do I really have to tell her who killed Lizaveta?”\n\nIt was a weird question to ask himself because he knew deep down he couldn’t avoid telling her. He felt this overwhelming urge to get it out, but it also crushed him to think about it. To end his inner struggle, he quickly opened the door and peered in at Sonia. She was sitting there, waiting.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, despite his own anguish, feels compelled to confront Sonia with the truth about Lizaveta's murder."
