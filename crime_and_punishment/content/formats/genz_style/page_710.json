  "text": "That innocent soul had been dragged through the mud, suffering a disgrace she didn’t deserve, letting out a final scream of despair into the cold, dark night while the wind howled. \n\nSvidrigaïlov shook himself awake, got out of bed, and headed to the window. He fumbled for the latch and opened it. The wind rushed in, hitting his bare chest like ice. Below, there was probably some kind of garden, maybe a spot where people enjoyed tea and music during the day. Now, rain splattered against the window from the trees outside, making everything look as dark as a basement. He leaned on the windowsill, staring into the darkness for five minutes. Suddenly, he heard the boom of a cannon, followed by another. “Ah, the signal! The river’s flooding,” he thought. “By morning, it’ll be rushing down the streets, filling up basements. Rats will swim out, and people will be cursing as they haul their junk upstairs.” \n\n“What time is it?” he wondered. Almost as if on cue, a nearby clock ticked loudly and struck three. \n\n“Aha! It’ll be light in an hour! Why wait? I’m heading out now to the park. I’ll find a big bush soaked with rain, so when someone brushes against it, they’ll get drenched.” \n\nHe stepped back from the window, closed it, and lit the candle.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov contemplates the darkness and impending flood outside his window, deciding to go out into the rain."
