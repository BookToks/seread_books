Seriously, it’d be way better to just jump into the water and end it all!” \n\nSonia looked at him, her eyes full of pain but not shocked by his words. “But what would happen to them?” she asked quietly.\n\nRaskolnikov studied her closely. He realized she must have thought about this before—maybe a lot. She had probably considered how to end her suffering so deeply that his suggestion didn’t even faze her. She didn’t even register the harshness of what he said. He understood that the weight of her shame had been torturing her for a long time. \n\n“What’s been stopping her from ending it?” he wondered. Then it hit him—those little orphan kids and the half-crazy Katerina Ivanovna, banging her head against the wall in her sickness, meant everything to Sonia.\n\nYet, he couldn’t shake the thought that with her background and education, she shouldn’t be able to endure this situation for so long without losing her mind. How had she managed to stay sane when she couldn’t even bring herself to take that leap?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov grapples with Sonia's enduring shame and despair, questioning how she can maintain her humanity amidst her degrading circumstances."
