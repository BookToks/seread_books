Then, Achilles broke the awkwardness. \n\n“What do you want here?” he asked, not budging from his spot. \n\n“Nothing, brother. Good morning,” Svidrigaïlov replied casually. \n\n“This isn’t the place,” Achilles shot back. \n\n“I’m off to foreign parts, brother.” \n\n“Foreign parts?” \n\n“Yeah, America.” \n\n“America.” \n\nSvidrigaïlov pulled out a revolver and cocked it. Achilles raised his eyebrows in surprise. \n\n“Hey, this isn’t the spot for jokes!” \n\n“Why not?” Svidrigaïlov shrugged. \n\n“Because it just isn’t.” \n\n“Doesn’t bother me. It’s a good spot. When they ask, just say he was going to America.” \n\nHe pressed the gun to his right temple. \n\n“You can’t do that here! It’s not the place!” Achilles exclaimed, his eyes widening. \n\nSvidrigaïlov pulled the trigger.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov, contemplating suicide, confronts Achilles while preparing to use a revolver."
