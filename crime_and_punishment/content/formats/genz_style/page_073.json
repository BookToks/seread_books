What are you doing here?” he yelled, fists clenched, shaking with anger. \n\n“What do you mean?” Svidrigaïlov shot back, looking all high and mighty. \n\n“Get lost, that’s what I mean.” \n\n“How dare you, you lowlife!” \n\nSvidrigaïlov raised his cane like he was ready to swing. Raskolnikov charged at him, not thinking about how this hefty dude could easily take him on. Just then, someone grabbed him from behind—a cop stepped in between them. \n\n“That’s enough, guys. No fighting in public. What’s going on? Who are you?” the officer asked, eyeing Raskolnikov’s shabby clothes. \n\nRaskolnikov stared at him. The cop had a no-nonsense look, with grey moustaches and a solid face. \n\n“You’re exactly who I need!” Raskolnikov exclaimed, grabbing the cop’s arm. “I’m a student, Raskolnikov… and you should know that too,” he added, turning to Svidrigaïlov. “Come on, I’ve got something to show you.” \n\nHe pulled the cop toward the girl. “Look at her—completely wasted. She just came down the boulevard. No telling who she is or what happened.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confronts a gentleman in anger while trying to protect a drunken girl he believes has been mistreated."
