He can eat later.” \n\n“Right,” Razumihin replied. They both backed out and closed the door. Half an hour passed. Raskolnikov opened his eyes and lay back, hands behind his head.\n\n“Who is that guy? Where did he come from? He must know everything. Why is he just showing up now? How did he see it all? Is that even possible?” Raskolnikov thought, feeling a chill run through him. “And that jewelry box Nikolay found—was that real? A clue? Just one tiny detail can turn into a mountain of proof! A fly could’ve seen it! Is that even real?” Suddenly, he felt disgusted by how weak he was. “I should’ve known better,” he thought, bitterly smiling. “How could I, knowing myself, pick up an axe and spill blood? I should’ve seen this coming… but I did know!” he whispered, full of despair. He paused, stuck on that thought.\n\n“No, real men aren’t like that. The true Master, the one who thinks he can do anything, storms Toulon, causes chaos in Paris, forgets an army in Egypt, wastes countless lives in Moscow, and still cracks jokes at Vilna.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov reflects on his weakness and the consequences of his actions, questioning the nature of guilt and the possibility of being above moral laws."
