  "text": "Andrey Semyonovitch was pretty clueless. He jumped on the progress bandwagon and the whole “younger generation” vibe out of pure excitement. He was just one of many dull folks—half-formed ideas, self-important, and not really educated—who latch onto trendy ideas only to mess them up and make them look ridiculous.\n\nEven though Lebeziatnikov was generally nice, he started to feel some negative vibes toward Pyotr Petrovitch. It was all happening without either of them realizing it. Andrey, despite his simplicity, began to notice that Pyotr was playing him and secretly looking down on him. He figured out that Pyotr wasn’t the kind of guy he thought he was. \n\nAndrey had tried to explain Fourier’s system and Darwin’s theory to Pyotr, but lately, Pyotr listened with sarcasm and even got rude. Pyotr was starting to suspect that Lebeziatnikov wasn’t just a regular simpleton but maybe a liar too. He realized that Andrey didn’t have any real connections and was just regurgitating second-hand info. He was a mess—definitely not someone you’d want to rely on!\n\nBy the way, during the last ten days, Pyotr had lapped up some weird praise from Andrey. He didn’t even protest when Andrey called him out for wanting to help create a new “commune” or for skipping the whole christening thing.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pyotr Petrovitch is depicted as a duplicitous character who secretly despises Andrey Semyonovitch while feigning interest in progressive ideas."
