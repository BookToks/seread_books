How low can you go!’ \n\nShe rushed to Sonia, wrapping her frail arms around her tightly. ‘Sonia! How could you take ten roubles from him? You silly girl! Hand it over—now!’ \n\nKaterina snatched the money from Sonia and crumpled it up, throwing it right in Luzhin’s face. It hit him in the eye and dropped to the floor. Amalia Ivanovna quickly moved to pick it up. Pyotr Petrovitch lost it. \n\n‘Someone hold that crazy woman!’ he shouted. \n\nJust then, more people showed up at the door, including two ladies. \n\n‘Crazy? Am I crazy? You’re the idiot!’ Katerina Ivanovna yelled. ‘You’re just a petty lawyer, a disgrace! Sonia a thief? She’d give away her last penny!’ She burst into hysterical laughter. ‘Can you believe this guy?’ She looked around. ‘And you?’ she pointed at the landlady. ‘You too, you junk food lover! You think she’s a thief? She hasn’t even left this room! Everyone saw her come straight from you and sit right next to me. Search her! If she hasn’t left, the money has to be on her! Search her!’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna defends Sonia against accusations of theft, passionately asserting her innocence and confronting Luzhin."
