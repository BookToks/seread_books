  "text": "I've talked to her a couple of times, and trust me, she's no fool. Sometimes she looks at me like she can see right through me. Her face? It’s like a painting—think Raphael’s Madonna. You know the one, right? The one that gives off this intense, spiritual vibe. Well, she’s got that going on too. \n\nRight after we got engaged, I splurged on gifts for her—about fifteen hundred roubles worth. Diamonds, pearls, and a fancy silver dressing case packed with all sorts of goodies. Even her face lit up when she saw them. \n\nJust yesterday, I picked her up and sat her on my lap. Maybe I was a bit too forward because she turned bright red and almost cried, but she tried to hide it. Then, out of nowhere, she threw her arms around me (first time she did that) and kissed me. She promised she’d be a good wife, devoted and happy to make me happy. All she wants in return is my respect—nothing else, no more gifts. \n\nHonestly, hearing a sweet sixteen in a cute dress, blushing and teary-eyed, say all that? It’s pretty mesmerizing, right? Totally worth it. But hey, let’s go visit my fiancée soon, just not right now!\n\nBut seriously, this age gap and where we are in life? It’s a bit wild. Am I really going through with this marriage?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The speaker describes his betrothed, a young girl who expresses her devotion and desire for respect, highlighting the fascination of their relationship despite the significant age difference."
