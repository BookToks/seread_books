He was in a ragged dressing gown, slippers on his bare feet, looking unkempt and unshaven. His face showed surprise.\n\n“Is it you?” he exclaimed. He took a good look at Raskolnikov, then whistled. “Wow, you’re really struggling! Brother, you’ve outdone me!” he said, eyeing Raskolnikov’s rags. “Come on in, you look worn out.”\n\nOnce Raskolnikov sank onto the American leather sofa— which was even worse off than his own—Razumihin noticed right away that he was sick.\n\n“Seriously, you’re ill, you know that?” He reached to check Raskolnikov’s pulse. Raskolnikov pulled his hand away.\n\n“Don’t worry about it,” he replied. “I’m not here for that. I don’t have any lessons… I wanted to, but I don’t really want lessons…”\n\n“Hey! You’re delirious, you know!” Razumihin observed, keeping a close eye on him.\n\n“No, I’m not.”\n\nRaskolnikov stood up from the sofa. Climbing the stairs, he hadn’t realized he’d actually be face to face with his friend. Now, he felt that the last thing he wanted was to see anyone at all. Frustration bubbled up inside him, and he almost choked on his own anger the moment he stepped into Razumihin’s space.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov visits Razumihin, revealing his ill state and inner turmoil while expressing a reluctance to engage with anyone."
