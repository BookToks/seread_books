What’s it to you?”  \n“You need a permit for that, and you don’t have one. You’re just drawing a crowd. Where do you stay?”  \n“A permit?” Katerina Ivanovna cried. “I buried my husband today. Who cares about a permit?”  \n“Calm down, ma’am,” the official said. “Let me help you. This isn’t the place for you. You look unwell.”  \n“Sir, you don’t understand!” Katerina Ivanovna shouted. “We’re going to Nevsky… Sonia! Sonia! Where are you? Why is everyone crying? Kolya, Lida, where are you going?” She suddenly panicked. “Oh, foolish kids! Kolya, Lida, where are you off to?”  \nKolya and Lida, freaked out by the crowd and their mom's wild behavior, grabbed each other’s hands and bolted when they saw the policeman who looked like he wanted to take them away. Weeping and breathless, Katerina Ivanovna chased after them. She looked desperate and messy as she ran. Sonia and Polenka sprinted after them.  \n“Bring them back, Sonia! Oh, ungrateful kids! Polenka! Catch them… I’m doing this for you…”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna, distraught after her husband's burial, frantically searches for her children amidst a chaotic crowd while facing a police official."
