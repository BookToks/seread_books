Raskolnikov almost lost it and made a huge mistake. 😳 \n\nThinking the old woman might freak out being alone, he figured his presence would calm her down. So, he grabbed the door and pulled it towards him to stop her from shutting it again. She didn’t pull back, but she held onto the handle, so he nearly yanked her out onto the stairs. \n\nShe stood in the doorway, blocking his way, so he went right up to her. She stepped back, startled, trying to say something but just staring at him wide-eyed. \n\n“Good evening, Alyona Ivanovna,” he said, trying to sound chill, but his voice cracked and trembled. “I’ve come… I brought something… but let’s go inside… to the light…” \n\nHe brushed past her into the room without waiting for an invite. The old woman rushed after him, her words spilling out. \n\n“What on earth? Who are you? What do you want?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confronts the old woman, Alyona Ivanovna, in a tense and suspicious encounter as he enters her room uninvited."
