I kinda got the vibe of the antics you’ve been pulling and what you told Sofya Semyonovna. What’s the deal with that? Am I just out of the loop? Seriously, break it down for me, my dude. Share the latest theories!”\n\n“You couldn’t have heard anything. You’re just making stuff up!” \n\n“I’m not even talking about that (though I did catch some whispers). I mean the way you keep sighing and moaning. The Schiller in you is always on edge, and now you’re telling me to stop eavesdropping? If you’re feeling this way, go tell the police about your little mess-up: you messed up your theory. But if you think it’s cool to not listen at doors but go ahead and off old ladies whenever you want, you might as well book a flight to America. Seriously, run! There’s still time. I’m being real here. Don’t have cash? I’ll spot you the fare.”\n\n“I’m not even thinking about that,” Raskolnikov shot back, clearly annoyed. \n\n“I get it (but no pressure, don’t talk about it if you’re not into it). I see the moral dilemmas you’re wrestling with—citizen duties and all that, right? Just forget them for now. They don’t matter to you at this point, ha-ha! You’ll claim you’re still a man and a citizen. If that’s true, you shouldn’t have gotten yourself into this mess. There’s no point in dwelling on it.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov mocks Raskolnikov's moral dilemmas and suggests he abandon his concerns about duty and ethics."
