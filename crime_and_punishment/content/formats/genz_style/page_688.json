What struck him was that a lot of brilliant people have done bad things and just ignored the law. He thought he was a genius too—at least for a while. But he’s been through a lot and is still struggling with the fact that he couldn’t come up with a theory that let him break the law boldly. That makes him feel like he’s not a genius, and that’s a tough pill to swallow for any young guy with pride, especially these days.\n\n“But what about guilt? You think he has no moral compass? Is he really like that?”\n\n“Ah, Avdotya Romanovna, everything’s a mess right now. It’s not like it was ever perfect. Russians, in general, have big ideas—broad like our vast land—and they can get pretty wild and chaotic. But it’s a bummer to be broad without true genius. Remember all those deep talks we had on the terrace after dinner? You used to call me too broad! Who knows, maybe we were chatting while he was plotting his next move. We don’t really have sacred traditions, especially among the educated crowd. At best, someone cobbles them together from books or old stories. But that’s mostly for the nerdy old-timers, so it feels almost rude for someone in society to do that. You know my views, though. I don’t blame anyone. I just stay out of it, and I’m good at that.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The discussion revolves around the idea that some individuals, believing themselves to be geniuses, justify wrongdoing by overstepping moral and legal boundaries, leading to a sense of humiliation when they fail to act boldly."
