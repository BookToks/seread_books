  "text": "Raskolnikov was clearly losing it. He must have found a way to sneak out while everyone was distracted. Koch kept freaking out, saying, “If I’d been there, he would’ve jumped out and taken me out with his axe.” Now he wants to throw a thanksgiving service—classic, right? 😂\n\n“Did anyone see the murderer?” someone asked. \n\n“Honestly, probably not. This place is like a Noah’s Ark,” said the head clerk, who was listening in. \n\n“It’s obvious,” Nikodim Fomitch insisted, sounding pretty convinced.\n\n“No way, it’s anything but obvious,” Ilya Petrovitch shot back.\n\nRaskolnikov grabbed his hat and headed for the door, but he never made it… \n\nWhen he came to, he was slumped in a chair, someone propping him up on one side, and another person holding a glass of yellowish liquid on the other. Nikodim Fomitch was staring at him intently. He managed to stand up.\n\n“What’s going on? Are you sick?” Nikodim Fomitch asked sharply.\n\n“He could barely sign his name,” the head clerk chimed in, settling back into his work.\n\n“How long have you been sick?” Ilya Petrovitch called out from his spot, still sifting through papers. He had rushed over when Raskolnikov fainted but left as soon as he woke up.\n\n“Since yesterday,” Raskolnikov muttered.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, feeling unwell, is questioned about his whereabouts and condition by Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch after fainting."
