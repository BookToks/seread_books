I was just waiting for you to come first.”\n\n“What are you talking about, Rodya?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna exclaimed, surprised.\n\n“Is he just saying that out of obligation?” Dounia wondered. “Is he apologizing like it’s some ritual or something?”\n\n“I just woke up and wanted to come to you, but I got held up because of my clothes. I forgot to ask Nastasya to clean up the blood…” He hesitated. “I just got dressed.”\n\n“Blood? What blood?” Pulcheria asked, alarmed.\n\n“Oh, it’s nothing—don’t worry.

But you remember everything!” Razumihin jumped in.\n\n“That’s true,” Raskolnikov said carefully. “I remember every little detail, but I can’t explain why I did what I did or went where I went.”\n\n“Classic case,” Zossimov added. “Sometimes people act super skillfully, but their judgment is totally off.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov struggles to communicate with his family while grappling with his troubled state of mind and a recent traumatic experience."
