  "text": "Raskolnikov totally freaked out. He grabbed the old woman's stuff but dropped it and bolted into the hallway. Fear was taking over, especially after that second, totally unexpected murder. He wanted to get out of there fast. If he had been thinking straight, realizing how messed up his situation was—how many more obstacles and possibly more crimes he’d have to deal with to escape—he might have just given up and turned himself in. Not out of fear, but pure horror at what he had done.\n\nThat feeling of disgust was growing stronger by the minute. There was no way he was going back to that box or the room for anything. But then, he started to feel kind of blank, almost dreamy. He lost track of what really mattered and fixated on small things. \n\nWhen he glanced into the kitchen and saw a bucket half-full of water, he remembered he needed to wash his hands and the axe. His hands were sticky with blood. He dropped the axe in the water, grabbed a piece of soap from a broken saucer on the windowsill, and started scrubbing his hands in the bucket. Once they were clean, he pulled the axe out, washed the blade, and spent a good three minutes cleaning the wood.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, overwhelmed by fear and loathing after committing a second murder, struggles with the horror of his actions while attempting to clean himself and the murder weapon."
