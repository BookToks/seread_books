  "text": "I’m not totally clueless. I’ll share something interesting: when I was defending my feelings for Avdotya Romanovna, I claimed I was a victim. But honestly? I don’t feel any love for her now, not even a bit. It’s weird because I did feel something before… \n\n“Maybe it’s just laziness and bad decisions,” Raskolnikov jumped in.\n\nYeah, I admit I’m lazy and messed up, but your sister has qualities that even I couldn’t ignore. But looking back, it feels like nonsense. \n\n“Have you realized that for long?” \n\nI started to notice it earlier, but I was sure just the day before yesterday, right after I got to Petersburg. I thought I was coming here to win Avdotya Romanovna’s heart and take down Mr. Luzhin. \n\n“Sorry to cut you off, but can you get to the point? I’m in a rush and need to head out…” \n\nOf course! So, I got here and decided on a certain… journey. I need to make some arrangements first. I left my kids with an aunt; they’re doing fine without me. And honestly, I’m not much of a dad anyway! I’ve only taken what Marfa Petrovna gave me last year. That’s enough for me. But let me get to the point: before this trip happens, I need to deal with Mr. Luzhin too. It’s not that I hate him, but he’s the reason I had a falling out with Marfa Petrovna when I found out she set this whole thing up.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The speaker reflects on their lack of love for Avdotya Romanovna and their intentions regarding her engagement to Mr. Luzhin."
