And keep insisting on it? Sounds sketchy, right? If you had a guilty conscience, you'd probably say you were losing it instead. Makes sense, doesn’t it? \n\nThere’s a sly vibe to that question. Raskolnikov pulls back on the sofa, confused, as Porfiry leans in, staring at him. \n\n“Another thing about Razumihin—you should’ve said he came on his own to cover your tracks! But you didn’t! You highlight that he came because of you.” \n\nRaskolnikov didn’t do that. A chill creeps down his spine. \n\n“You’re lying,” he says slowly, forcing a weak smile. “You’re just trying to show you know my whole plan, that you can predict everything I’ll say.” He realizes he’s not choosing his words carefully. “You want to scare me… or you’re just mocking me…” \n\nHe keeps his gaze locked on Porfiry, feeling a surge of intense hatred in his eyes. \n\n“You’re lying,” he repeats. “You know the best move for a criminal is to be as honest as possible… to hide as little as you can. I don’t believe you!”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov struggles with his guilt and paranoia as Porfiry questions his honesty regarding his involvement in a crime."
