The setting sun lit it up brightly. \n\n‘So the sun shines like this too!’ he thought quickly, scanning the room to remember how it looked. But there wasn’t much to note. The old furniture was yellow wood: a sofa with a big, curved back, an oval table in front, a dressing table with a mirror between the windows, some chairs along the walls, and a few cheap prints of German girls with birds in their hands. That was it. In the corner, a light burned in front of a small ikon (a religious image). Everything was spotless; the floor and furniture gleamed.\n\n‘Lizaveta must’ve cleaned,’ he thought. There wasn’t a speck of dust anywhere in the flat. \n\n‘You always find cleanliness in the homes of cranky old widows,’ he mused.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov visits an old woman to pawn something, feeling uneasy about her mistrust and observing the cleanliness of her modest flat."
