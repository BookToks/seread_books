Bye.’  \nHe walked away without a handshake.  \n‘But where are you going? What’s going on? How can you just leave like this?’ Razumihin muttered, totally confused.  \nRaskolnikov stopped again.  \n‘Listen up, don’t ask me anything. I’ve got nothing to say. Don’t visit me. Maybe I’ll show up here… Just leave me alone, but don’t ditch them. Got it?’  \nIt was dark in the hallway, and they were near the lamp. They stared at each other in silence for a moment. Razumihin would remember that moment forever. Raskolnikov’s intense eyes seemed to dig deeper, piercing into his soul. Suddenly, Razumihin felt a chill. Something weird passed between them—an awful understanding that hit them both. Razumihin went pale.  \n‘Do you get it now?’ Raskolnikov asked, his face twitching. ‘Go back to them,’ he said suddenly, and then he rushed out of the house.  \nI won’t even try to explain how Razumihin went back to the ladies—how he calmed them down, how he insisted that Rodya needed rest, how he promised Rodya would come, that he was really upset, and that they shouldn’t worry.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov insists that Razumihin should leave him alone and return to the others, hinting at a deeper, troubling understanding between them."
