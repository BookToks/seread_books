So, brother, to cut to the chase, I was ready to blow everything up here and get rid of all the bad vibes, but Pashenka surprised me. I didn’t expect her to be so… charming. What do you think?’ \n\nRaskolnikov stayed silent, his eyes locked on Razumihin, filled with worry. \n\n‘She’s everything you could want, really,’ Razumihin continued, completely unfazed by the silence. \n\n‘Oh, the sly one!’ Nastasya burst out again, clearly enjoying the chat. \n\n‘It’s a shame you didn’t handle things better from the start. You should’ve approached her differently. She’s quite the enigma. But we can dive into her character later… How could you let it get to the point where she stopped bringing you dinner? And that I.O.U.? You must’ve been crazy to sign it. And that marriage promise when her daughter, Natalya Yegorovna, was alive? I know all about it! But I get it, that’s a touchy subject and I’m being nosy; my bad. Speaking of foolishness, you know Praskovya Pavlovna isn’t nearly as clueless as you think.’\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin discusses the complexities of a woman's character and Raskolnikov's past decisions regarding her."
