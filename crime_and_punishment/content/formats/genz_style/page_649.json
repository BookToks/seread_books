  "text": "What if Svidrigaïlov still had plans for Dounia? It felt almost guaranteed. If he found out Raskolnikov's secret, he could use it against her. This thought haunted him, especially on his way to see Svidrigaïlov. Just thinking about it made him furious. \n\nThis would change everything, including his own situation. He might have to come clean to Dounia. Would he need to turn himself in to keep her safe from making a bad choice? What about that letter she got this morning? Who else could be sending her letters in Petersburg? Maybe Luzhin? Sure, Razumihin was there to look out for her, but he didn’t know the whole story. Should he tell Razumihin? The idea made him feel sick.\n\nHe needed to meet Svidrigaïlov ASAP. The details didn’t matter much; he just wanted to get to the bottom of things. But if Svidrigaïlov was plotting against Dounia… then what?\n\nRaskolnikov was so worn out from everything he’d been through that month that he could only think one way: “Then I’ll kill him,” he thought, feeling hopeless.\n\nSuddenly, a wave of panic hit him. He stopped in the street, looking around to figure out where he was and where to go next. He realized he was on X. Prospect, just a short walk from the Hay Market.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is tormented by the fear that Svidrigaïlov may use his knowledge of Raskolnikov's secret to manipulate or harm Dounia, leading him to contemplate violence against Svidrigaïlov."
