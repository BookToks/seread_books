Did they really care so deeply for a sliver of sunshine, the ancient forest, or a hidden spring they had marked years ago? They longed to see it again, like missing a crush, imagining the green grass and birds singing nearby. \n\nAs he observed more, he noticed things he had previously ignored. He kept his head down because it was hard to look at the reality around him. But eventually, he was struck by the shocking divide between him and the others. They felt like a different species. They exchanged glances filled with distrust and hostility. He understood why he felt so isolated, but he hadn’t realized how deep those reasons ran. \n\nAmong them were Polish exiles, political prisoners, who looked down on the others as ignorant peasants.
