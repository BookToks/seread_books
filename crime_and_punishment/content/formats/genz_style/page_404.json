At least there, you can blame everyone else and avoid taking responsibility. I should’ve maybe gone on an adventure to the North Pole since I can’t stand drinking, and all that’s left is wine. I’ve tried it, but it’s not for me. \n\nAnyway, I heard Berg is taking people up in a big balloon next Sunday from the Yusupov Garden. Is that true? \n\n“Are you going to go?” \n\n“Me? No way,” Svidrigaïlov said, looking lost in thought. \n\n“What’s he on about? Is he serious?” Raskolnikov wondered. \n\n“The document didn’t hold me back,” Svidrigaïlov continued, deep in his own world. “It was my choice to stay here. Almost a year ago, Marfa Petrovna returned the document to me on my name day and even gave me a nice chunk of money. She had a lot of money, you know.

Marfa Petrovna liked it at first, but then she got worried I’d study too much.” \n\n“Sounds like you really miss Marfa Petrovna.” \n\n“Miss her? Maybe. Honestly, I might.
