  "text": "Raskolnikov sat there for a while, deep in thought. Finally, he stood up and walked over to Sonia. She looked up at him, silent. His face was serious, almost fierce.\n\n“I’ve cut ties with my family today,” he said. “I’m done with my mom and sister. It’s over.”\n\n“Why?” Sonia asked, shocked. She had just met his family and the visit had hit her hard. Hearing his news felt like a punch to the gut.\n\n“I only have you now,” he continued. “Let’s leave together. We’re both outcasts, so let’s walk this path side by side!”\n\nHis eyes sparkled in a way that made Sonia think he might be losing it. \n\n“Where are we going?” she asked, fear creeping in as she instinctively took a step back.\n\n“Who knows? I just know it’s the same road. That’s all I’ve got. Same destination!” \n\nSonia stared at him, confused. All she felt was his deep, endless sadness.\n\n“They won’t get it if you tell them, but I do. I need you, which is why I’m here.”\n\n“I don’t get it,” Sonia whispered.\n\n“You will later. Haven’t you done something similar? You’ve crossed lines too… you’ve had the power to break free.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov confesses to Sonia that he has severed ties with his family and seeks to share a path of despair with her, both feeling accursed."
