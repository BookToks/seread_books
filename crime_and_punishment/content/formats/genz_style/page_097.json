  "text": "Raskolnikov had three red stones, a gift from his sister when they parted ways. He decided to grab the ring. When he first saw the old woman, he felt a strong disgust, even though he didn’t know much about her. He got two roubles from her and headed to a shabby little tavern on his way home. He ordered tea, sat down, and got lost in thought. A weird idea was nagging at him like a chick trying to break out of its shell.\n\nAt the next table, a student he didn’t know was hanging out with a young officer. They had just played billiards and were now drinking tea. Suddenly, he heard the student mention the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna and share her address. It struck Raskolnikov as odd; he had just left her place, and now her name popped up again. It felt like fate, and he couldn’t shake off the feeling that they were talking about her for him. \n\n“She’s top-notch,” the student said. “You can always get cash from her. She’s loaded, can lend you five thousand roubles at once, and she’ll even take a pledge for a rouble. A lot of guys deal with her. But she’s a total nightmare…” \n\nHe went on to describe how nasty and unpredictable she was. If you were even a day late on your interest, you’d lose your pledge. She’d give you a quarter of what something was worth and charge five to seven percent a month on it.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov feels a strange connection to the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna after overhearing a conversation about her at a tavern."
