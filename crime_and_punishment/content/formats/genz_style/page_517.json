  "text": "Sure, here’s the rewritten text for Gen Z readers:\n\n---\n\nDefinitely not an insult, but more like a protest. I’d be doing it for a solid reason. I could help spread awareness and ideas. It’s every person’s job to push for enlightenment (basically, knowledge and understanding) and sometimes being blunt is the way to go. I might plant a seed, an idea… and who knows what could grow from that? How could I be insulting them? Sure, they might be mad at first, but eventually, they’d realize I was helping them out.\n\nTake Terebyeva, for example (she’s part of the community now). People criticized her for leaving her family and being upfront with her parents about not living a traditional life anymore. She told them she was entering a free marriage, and folks thought she should have been nicer about it. Honestly, that’s just silly—no need to sugarcoat things. What’s really needed is a protest.\n\nVarents was married for seven years and left her two kids behind. She wrote her husband a letter saying, “I can’t be happy with you. I can’t forgive you for hiding that there’s another way to live, with communities. I just found this out from an amazing guy I’m with now, and we’re starting our own community. I’m being honest because I think it’s wrong to lie to you. Do what you want, but don’t think you can win me back. It’s too late. I hope you find happiness.” That’s how letters should be written!\n\n“Is Terebyeva the one you mentioned who’s had three free marriages?”\n\n---\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The text discusses the importance of protest and honesty in personal relationships, advocating for direct communication over softness."
