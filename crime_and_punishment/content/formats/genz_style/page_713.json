  "text": "She stopped trying to control them. Instead, she just grinned—this big, bold grin. It was shameless and provocative, not at all childlike. It felt depraved, like the face of a French harlot. Her eyes opened wide, glowing with a shameless look that seemed to laugh and invite him in. There was something deeply disturbing about that laugh, those eyes, that kind of nastiness on a child's face. \n\n\"Seriously? At five years old?\" Svidrigaïlov muttered, horrified. \"What does that even mean?\" She turned to him, her little face lit up, arms reaching out. \n\n“Cursed child!” he shouted, raising his hand to hit her—but then he woke up.\n\nHe was in bed, still wrapped in a blanket. The candle was unlit, and daylight flooded in through the windows. \n\n“I’ve had nightmares all night!” he grumbled, feeling wrecked. His bones ached. Outside, a thick mist covered everything; he could barely see. It was nearly five—he had overslept! He got up, put on his damp jacket and overcoat. \n\nFeeling the revolver in his pocket, he pulled it out, then sat down and took out a notebook. He wrote a few lines in big letters on the title page. After reading them, he sank into thought, resting his elbows on the table. The revolver and notebook sat beside him. Some flies buzzed around and landed on the untouched veal still on the table. He stared at them and eventually started trying to catch one. He kept at it until he was too tired, but he just couldn’t catch it.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov wakes from a disturbing nightmare, feeling shattered and contemplating his next actions with a revolver and a notebook at hand."
