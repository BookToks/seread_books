  "text": "In his response, he said that since he needs a secretary, it makes sense to pay a family member instead of a stranger—if you’re qualified (which you totally are!). But he did question whether your university studies would leave you enough time to work at his office. That conversation ended there, but Dounia can’t stop thinking about it. She’s been kind of obsessed for days and has already mapped out a plan for you to eventually become an associate or even a partner in Pyotr Petrovitch’s business. This could totally happen since you’re studying law!\n\nI’m all in on her plans and hopes, and I really believe we can make this work. Even though Pyotr Petrovitch is a bit noncommittal right now (he doesn’t know you yet), Dounia is convinced she can win him over with her charm. We’re careful not to mention any long-term plans to him, especially about you becoming a partner. He’s a practical guy and might brush it off as a fantasy. \n\nNeither Dounia nor I have brought up our hopes for him to help fund your university studies either. We’re keeping quiet for now because we think it’ll happen naturally later on. He’ll probably offer to help without us even asking (like, how could he say no to Dounia?). Plus, once you start working with him, he’ll be more likely to support you.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia is fervently planning for Rodya to work with Pyotr Petrovitch, believing it could lead to a partnership and financial support for his university studies."
