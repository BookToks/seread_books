Because they created new laws that broke the old ones, which were sacred to their people. They didn’t shy away from bloodshed, even if it meant innocent people got hurt while defending those ancient laws. It’s wild, but most of these so-called benefactors and leaders caused a lot of destruction. \n\nIn short, I believe that all great or even slightly above-average people—those who can introduce new ideas—are, by nature, criminals to some degree. If they weren’t, they’d just stay stuck in the same old routine, which they can’t handle, and honestly, they shouldn’t have to. \n\nThere’s nothing groundbreaking here; this idea has been said a million times. My take on dividing people into ordinary and extraordinary might seem a bit random, but I’m not fussed about exact numbers. I just think there’s a natural law that splits people into two groups: the ordinary (who just keep reproducing) and those who have the talent to say something new. Sure, there are tons of subcategories, but the main traits of each group are pretty clear. \n\nThe first group tends to be conservative and law-abiding; they thrive under control and feel comfortable there.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov argues that all great leaders and innovators are inherently criminals for transgressing established laws to create change."
