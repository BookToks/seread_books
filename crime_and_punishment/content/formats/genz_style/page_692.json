The Kapernaumovs are far away—five locked rooms between us. I’m at least twice as strong as you, and I have nothing to worry about. Besides, you wouldn’t actually betray your brother, would you? No one would believe you anyway. How could a girl visit a solitary guy in his place? Even if you tried to save your brother, you couldn’t prove anything. Proving an assault is really tough, Avdotya Romanovna.”  \n“Scoundrel!” Dounia hissed, furious.  \n“Suit yourself, but I was just making a point. Honestly, I think you’re right—violence is awful. I just wanted to show you that you shouldn’t feel guilty if… you decide to save your brother, as I suggest. You’d just be dealing with the situation, facing the violence, if we’re being real. Think about it. Your brother’s and your mom’s fate are in your hands. I’ll be your slave… forever… I’ll wait right here.”  \nSvidrigaïlov plopped down on the sofa about eight steps away from Dounia.

So that’s how it is?” he exclaimed, surprised but grinning wickedly. “Well, that changes everything.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dounia confronts Svidrigaïlov about his threats, revealing her own readiness to defend herself with a revolver."
