He added, “I mention it because there were so many pledges… must be hard to keep track of them all. But you seem to remember every detail…” \n\n“Ugh, that was dumb. Why did I even say that?” he thought, feeling embarrassed. \n\nPorfiry replied, barely hiding his sarcasm, “We know everyone who had pledges, and you’re the only one who hasn’t shown up.” \n\n“I haven’t been feeling well,” Raskolnikov said. \n\n“I heard you were in a bit of a crisis. You still look pale.” \n\n“I’m not pale! I’m fine!” Raskolnikov snapped, his tone shifting sharply. Anger bubbled up inside him. “If I keep getting angry, I’ll slip up,” he thought. “Why are they putting me through this?” \n\n“Not feeling well?” Razumihin jumped in. “He was out cold and delirious yesterday! Can you believe it, Porfiry? As soon as we left, he dressed up, even though he could barely stand, and took off for a wild night until midnight! Crazy, right?” \n\n“Really? Delirious? No way!” Porfiry shook his head, acting all dramatic. \n\n“Come on! Don’t buy into that! But I guess you wouldn’t believe me anyway,” Raskolnikov shot back in frustration.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov struggles with his emotions and the perception of his health while conversing with Porfiry and Razumihin."
