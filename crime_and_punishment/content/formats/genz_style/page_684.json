  "text": "Svidrigaïlov led Dounia into his place, which had two empty rooms available for rent. He occupied two decent-sized furnished rooms himself. Dounia looked around, feeling uneasy, but nothing seemed off about the furniture or layout. Still, it was odd that his flat was sandwiched between two nearly vacant apartments. \n\nHis rooms weren’t accessed directly from the hallway; you had to go through the landlady’s two almost-empty rooms first. He unlocked a door from his bedroom to show Dounia the empty rooms. She hesitated in the doorway, unsure of what she was supposed to see, but Svidrigaïlov quickly explained.\n\n“Check out this second big room. See that locked door? There’s a chair next to it—the only one in both rooms. I brought it from my side so I could listen in more easily. Just beyond that door is Sofya Semyonovna’s table; she was chatting with Rodion Romanovitch there. I listened in for two hours on two different nights, so you can guess I picked up a few things, right?”\n\n“You were eavesdropping?” Dounia asked.\n\n“Yep. Now let’s head back to my room; we can’t hang out here.” \n\nHe guided Avdotya Romanovna back into his living room and offered her a chair. He took a seat across the table, keeping a good distance of about seven feet from her.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov reveals to Dounia that he has been eavesdropping on conversations between her and Rodion from a hidden position in his flat."
