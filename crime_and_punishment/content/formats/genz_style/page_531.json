  "text": "It’s hard to pin down what sparked that ridiculous dinner idea in Katerina Ivanovna’s chaotic mind. She ended up blowing almost ten of the twenty roubles Raskolnikov had given for Marmeladov’s funeral on it. Maybe she felt she had to honor the deceased “properly,” so all the lodgers—and especially Amalia Ivanovna—would know he was no less than they were, and maybe even better. She didn’t want anyone looking down on him. \n\nA big part of this was probably that “poor man’s pride.” Many people in tough spots spend their last cash on social events just to fit in and avoid being judged. Katerina Ivanovna might have wanted to show those “wretched contemptible lodgers” that she could throw a proper gathering, that she wasn’t just a maid from a broken home. She came from a genteel, almost aristocratic family, and she wasn’t meant to be stuck cleaning floors or washing kids' rags at night. \n\nEven the most down-and-out people can have these moments of pride and vanity, driven by a strong need to prove themselves. And Katerina Ivanovna was definitely not broken-spirited.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Katerina Ivanovna's decision to host a lavish dinner for Marmeladov's funeral reflects her struggle with pride and the desire to assert her social status despite her poverty."
