Soaked to the bone, he walked into the small flat where his fiancée's parents lived on Third Street, Vassilyevsky Island. He knocked for a while before they let him in, and at first, his arrival caused a bit of a stir. The parents thought he might be drunk and clueless, but Svidrigaïlov could charm people when he wanted to, so they quickly brushed that idea aside. \n\nThe frail father was brought in by the caring mother, who kicked things off with a bunch of random questions. She never got straight to the point. Instead, she smiled and rubbed her hands together, and when she needed to know something—like when Svidrigaïlov wanted to set the wedding date—she’d start chatting about Paris and fancy court life before slowly steering the conversation back to their street. \n\nUsually, this would impress them, but tonight, Arkady Ivanovitch was clearly restless. He insisted on seeing his fiancée right away, even though they had told him she was already in bed. Of course, the girl showed up. Svidrigaïlov wasted no time and told her he had to leave Petersburg for important reasons.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov unexpectedly visits the parents of his betrothed, causing initial confusion before insisting on seeing her."
