  "text": "**Crime and Punishment**  \n**Chapter III**\n\nHonestly, he never saw this ending coming. He was super cocky, thinking that two broke and helpless women would always be under his thumb. His ego was through the roof, almost ridiculous. Pyotr Petrovitch, who climbed up from nothing, was obsessed with himself. He thought he was a genius and sometimes even admired himself in the mirror. But what really mattered to him was the cash he’d racked up through hard work and clever tricks. That money made him feel equal to those who used to look down on him.\n\nWhen he reminded Dounia that he was taking her in despite the rumors, he meant it. He was genuinely upset about what he called \"black ingratitude.\" But when he proposed to Dounia, he knew the gossip was baseless. Marfa Petrovna had already cleared things up, and everyone in town was backing Dounia. He couldn’t deny that he was aware of this at the time. Still, he felt proud of himself for thinking he could elevate Dounia to his level.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Pyotr Petrovitch, blinded by vanity and self-admiration, fails to recognize the strength of the women he seeks to control and ultimately underestimates their resilience."
