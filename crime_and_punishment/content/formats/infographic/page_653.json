You turned mechanically.”  \n“Why would I remember that?” Raskolnikov frowned.  \n“You give yourself away too much, Rodion Romanovitch.”  \nSvidrigaïlov continued, “Petersburg is full of crazy people.  \nI’ve watched you. You walk with your head high,  \nthen let it sink, hands behind your back.  \nYou talk to yourself, wave your hands,  \nand sometimes stand still in the road.”  \nRaskolnikov looked away, lost in thought.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's mechanical behavior and introspective nature are observed and commented on by Svidrigaïlov, highlighting the psychological impact of Petersburg's environment."
