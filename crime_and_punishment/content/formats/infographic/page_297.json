She’s not that sort.” \n\n“Then drop her!” \n\n“I can’t just drop her!” \n\n“Why not?” \n\n“I can’t, that’s all.” \n\n“Why have you fascinated her?” \n\n“I didn’t! Perhaps I was fascinated myself.” \n\n“Then teach her something. Math, maybe.” \n\n“Math?” \n\n“Integral calculus. She’ll sigh for a year.” \n\n“I talked endlessly about the Prussian House of Lords. She sighed.” \n\n“Just sit beside her. Don’t mention love.” \n\nRaskolnikov nodded slowly.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Razumihin encourages Raskolnikov to engage with a woman by simply being present and talking to her, suggesting that emotional connection can develop without the need for promises or declarations of love."
