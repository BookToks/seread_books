How do you like my dress?” \n\nI studied her face. \n\n“Such trifles, Marfa Petrovna?” \n\n“Good gracious, don’t let anything disturb you!” \n\nI teased, “I want to get married.” \n\n“That’s like you! You’ve hardly buried your wife.” \n\nHer train rustled as she left. \n\n“Isn’t it nonsense?” \n\nRaskolnikov interjected, “But perhaps you are telling lies?” \n\n“I rarely lie,” Svidrigaïlov replied. \n\n“Have you seen ghosts?” \n\n“Yes, once. After Filka’s burial, he came for my pipe.” \n\nI sat still, pondering revenge.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Marfa Petrovna visits Svidrigaïlov, showcasing her new dress and teasing him about seeking a bride shortly after his wife's death."
