  "text": "“I don’t want to be a fool,” Luzhin said. “I want legal marriage.”\n\n“Children?” Lebeziatnikov exclaimed, eager. “They’re a social question. \n\nSome refuse children. They challenge the family institution.”\n\nHe paused, deep in thought. “Honour is my weak point. \n\nThat military expression is nonsense. \n\nFree marriage means no deception. \n\nIt’s a protest, a corrective.”\n\nLuzhin frowned. \n\nLebeziatnikov continued, “If I were married, I’d respect my wife. \n\n‘You’ve shown you can protest!’ I’d say.”\n\nLuzhin laughed, shaking his head. \n\n“Prejudices cloud your mind,” Lebeziatnikov declared. \n\n“Deception in legal marriage is despicable. \n\nOpen deception? Unthinkable.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Luzhin argues that legal marriage is necessary to avoid humiliation and deception, while Lebeziatnikov contends that free marriage eliminates such issues by allowing open relationships."
