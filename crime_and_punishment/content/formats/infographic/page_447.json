Tears filled her eyes. \n\n“I’m sorry,” she whispered.\n\nRaskolnikov turned away, sitting at the table. \n\nHe scanned the room quickly. \n\nThree windows faced the canal, but light barely reached them. \n\nA bedstead and a chair sat in the corner. \n\nA plain table covered with a blue cloth stood by the door. \n\nTwo rush-bottom chairs flanked it. \n\nA small chest of drawers seemed lost in the emptiness. \n\nThe walls were yellow and scratched, corners black with damp. \n\nSonia trembled, watching him inspect her poverty. \n\n“What do you think?” she asked, her voice barely a whisper. \n\nHe didn’t answer.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov visits Sonia's impoverished and dismal room, reflecting the starkness of her living conditions."
