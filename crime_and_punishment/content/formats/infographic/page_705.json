I pulled you from the gutter!\" \n\nThe other man sat, eyes glazed, wanting to sneeze. \n\nSvidrigaïlov peered through the crack. \n\nA candle flickered on the table. \n\nGlasses held dregs of vodka and stale tea. \n\nHe turned away, indifferent, and sat on his bed. \n\nThe ragged attendant returned with tea. \n\n\"Anything else?\" he asked. \n\n\"Nothing, nothing,\" Svidrigaïlov replied. \n\nHe drank the tea quickly but felt feverish.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov observes a heated argument between two men in an adjacent room while feeling feverish and indifferent to his surroundings."
