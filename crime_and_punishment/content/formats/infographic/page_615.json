We’ll talk soon,” Svidrigaïlov continued. \n\nHe stepped aside for the priest and server. \n\n“Fresh air is what you need,” he added, then left.\n\nRaskolnikov followed the priest into Sonia’s room. \n\nHe paused at the door. \n\nThe requiem service began, slow and mournful. \n\nChildren knelt by the coffin, tears in their eyes. \n\nDeath felt oppressive, haunting him. \n\nHe remembered the weight of loss.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Svidrigaïlov discusses the placement of orphans and expresses concern for Raskolnikov's well-being while preparing for a requiem service."
