  "text": "A man sat before a pot of beer. He was an artisan, drunk but not too much. Beside him, a stout man with a grey beard slept on the bench. \n\nThe stout man stirred, cracking his fingers. He hummed a tune, trying to remember the words. \n\n“His wife a year he fondly loved...” \n\nHe woke suddenly, “Walking along the crowded row...” \n\nNo one joined him. The artisan’s companion watched, filled with hostility. \n\nIn the corner, a retired clerk sipped his drink, eyes darting around the room. He felt restless, anxious in the noise.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov observes a drunken man in a tavern, highlighting the contrasting emotions and social dynamics present in the scene."
