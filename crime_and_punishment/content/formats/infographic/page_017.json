Without thinking, he descended the steps. \n\nHe had never entered a tavern before. \n\nHe sat at a sticky table in a dark corner. \n\n“I need a drink,” he muttered. \n\nHe ordered beer and gulped it down. Relief washed over him. \n\n“All that’s nonsense,” he said, hopeful. “Just a drink and some bread.” \n\nHe smiled, feeling lighter, free from a heavy burden. \n\nYet, a shadow of doubt lingered. \n\nThe tavern was nearly empty now. Raskolnikov glanced around, searching for comfort.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, feeling giddy and tormented by thirst, enters a tavern for the first time, seeking relief through beer, which temporarily clears his mind but also raises concerns about his mental state."
