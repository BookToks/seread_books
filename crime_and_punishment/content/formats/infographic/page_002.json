  "text": "Dostoevsky grew up in a cramped apartment. His parents worked hard and prayed deeply. They read serious books to their five children each evening.\n\nSickly and delicate, he excelled in school. He ranked third in the Petersburg Engineering exam. He began writing \"Poor Folk.\" \n\nThe poet Nekrassov published it. Acclamations followed. He felt like a celebrity.\n\nThen came 1849. He was arrested. \n\nDostoevsky wasn't a revolutionary. He joined a group to discuss ideas. They read Fourier and Proudhon. \n\nHe faced accusations of conspiracy. The weight of censorship loomed over him.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dostoevsky, despite his promising beginnings and literary acclaim, faced arrest and condemnation due to his involvement in discussions against censorship."
