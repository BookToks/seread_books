  "text": "Dostoevsky grew up in a cramped two-room flat. \n\nHis parents worked hard and prayed deeply. \n\nEvenings were filled with serious readings. \n\nSickly and delicate, he excelled in school. \n\nHe ranked third at the Petersburg Engineering school. \n\nHis first story, ‘Poor Folk,’ gained acclaim. \n\nSuddenly, he was a young celebrity. \n\nBut hope faded fast. \n\nIn 1849, he was arrested. \n\nNot a revolutionary by nature, he joined discussions. \n\nThey read Fourier and Proudhon. \n\nHe faced accusations of subversion. \n\nHis dreams shattered under Nicholas I.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dostoevsky, despite his promising beginnings as a writer, faced arrest in 1849 for his involvement in discussions against censorship."
