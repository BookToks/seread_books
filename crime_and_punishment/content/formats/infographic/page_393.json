A fly buzzed against the window. \n\nHe noticed a cloak in the corner. \n\n“Why is that here?” he thought. \n\nHe approached quietly, sensing someone behind it. \n\nHe moved the cloak. The old woman sat, bent over. \n\n“She is afraid,” he thought. \n\nHe took the axe and struck her. Once, then again. \n\nShe didn’t stir, like wood. \n\nHe bent closer. She laughed silently, shaking with mirth. \n\nFrenzy overtook him. He struck harder. \n\nWith each blow, her laughter grew louder. \n\nHe rushed away, but the passage was crowded.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov, in a state of panic and frenzy, attacks an old woman with an axe, but is haunted by her laughter and the sounds from the bedroom."
