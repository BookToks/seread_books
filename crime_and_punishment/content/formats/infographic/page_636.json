  "text": "“Do you know, Rodion Romanovitch, the force of ‘suffering’?” \n\nThe elder’s words echoed in his mind. \n\n“It’s not for someone’s benefit. One must suffer.” \n\nHe recalled a meek prisoner. \n\nThe man read his Bible on the stove every night. \n\nHe read until he went crazy. \n\nOne day, he seized a brick. \n\nHe threw it at the governor, but missed. \n\n“Well, we know what happens to a prisoner,” he mused. \n\n“Now Nikolay wants to take his suffering. \n\nHe doesn’t know I know.” \n\n“Do you think he’ll hold out?” \n\n“I’ve come to like Nikolay,” he said, studying him closely. \n\n“He answered me plausibly on some points. \n\nBut on others, he’s simply at sea.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The discussion revolves around the concept of suffering among individuals, particularly in the context of a prisoner influenced by religious beliefs and the expectations of enduring hardship."
