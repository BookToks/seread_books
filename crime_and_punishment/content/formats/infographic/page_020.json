A retired clerk stared back. \n\nThe clerk looked weary, yet condescending. \n\n\"Why do you watch me?\" Raskolnikov asked. \n\nThe clerk smirked, his eyes gleaming. \n\n\"Curiosity,\" he replied, voice low. \n\nHe wore a ragged coat, only one button remaining. \n\nHis face was bloated, yellowish, almost mad. \n\nRaskolnikov felt a strange connection. \n\n\"Have you seen much?\" he probed. \n\nThe clerk leaned closer. \n\n\"Too much,\" he whispered, a hint of despair. \n\nSomething flickered in his eyes. \n\nRaskolnikov shivered.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov is intrigued by a peculiar retired clerk in a tavern, who exudes a mix of intelligence and madness despite his disheveled appearance."
