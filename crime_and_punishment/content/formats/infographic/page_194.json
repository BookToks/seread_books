No mushrooms or meat.”\n\nRazumihin met Zossimov’s gaze. \n\n“Tomorrow evening, I’ll take him for a walk. Yusupov garden, Palais de Crystal.”\n\n“I wouldn’t disturb him tomorrow,” Zossimov replied. “Maybe a little.”\n\nRazumihin sighed. \n\n“What a nuisance! I have a house-warming party tonight. He could lie on the sofa.”\n\n“Are you coming?” Razumihin asked.\n\n“Later,” Zossimov said. \n\n“Just tea, vodka, herrings. Pie, too,” Razumihin added.\n\n“Who’s coming?” Zossimov inquired.\n\n“Neighbors, mostly. My uncle just arrived.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Zossimov monitors a patient's condition while discussing plans for a house-warming party with Razumihin."
