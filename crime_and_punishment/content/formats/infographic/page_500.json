He turned back. \n\n“Why comical?” Porfiry Petrovitch asked, intrigued.\n\n“You’ve tortured poor Nikolay till he confessed. Now you’ll vivisect him again.”\n\nPorfiry chuckled. “You noticed I said it wasn’t his tale?”\n\n“How could I not?”\n\n“You’re quick-witted. They say that’s Gogol’s trait.”\n\n“Yes, of Gogol.”\n\n“I look forward to meeting you.”\n\n“So shall I.”\n\nRaskolnikov walked home, muddled and bewildered.
