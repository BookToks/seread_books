They need me.” \n\nBut she hid the truth. \n\nThe authorities watched him through her. \n\nRaskolnikov grew pale and silent. \n\nHis fellow prisoners avoided him. \n\nThen came the news. \n\nHe was seriously ill, in the hospital.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Raskolnikov's isolation and declining health in prison distress Sonia, who remains devoted to him despite her own struggles."
