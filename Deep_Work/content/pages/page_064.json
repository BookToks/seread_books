  "simplified_text": "In the 1920s, Jung was trying to break away from his mentor, Sigmund Freud. To help with this, he started going to a simple stone house he built in the woods near Bollingen. Every morning, he would lock himself in a basic room to write without being disturbed. After writing, he would meditate and walk in the woods to clear his mind for the next day’s work. I believe he did this to make his deep work stronger so he could compete with Freud and his followers.\n\nIt's important to note that Jung didn’t live a completely isolated life focused only on deep work. Unlike Donald Knuth and Neal Stephenson, who tried to cut out distractions completely, Jung only did this during his time at the retreat. The rest of the time, he was busy in Zurich, where he saw patients late into the night, enjoyed the coffeehouse scene, and gave lectures at universities. Interestingly, Einstein, who studied and taught in Zurich, also knew Jung, and they had dinners together to talk about Einstein’s ideas.\n\nJung’s way of working is what I call the bimodal philosophy of deep work. This means you split your time between focused deep work and everything else. When doing deep work, you focus intensely without interruptions. During the other times, you don’t need to concentrate as much. You can plan this on different scales. For example, you might spend a long weekend on deep work and the rest of the week on other things. Or, you could dedicate a whole season to deep work, like many teachers do in the summer.\n\nThe bimodal philosophy believes that deep work can lead to amazing productivity, but you need to spend enough time on it to really get into the zone where big ideas happen. That’s why, for this approach, deep work usually needs to last at least a full day. Just a few hours in the morning isn’t enough to count as deep work.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Jung developed a bimodal approach to deep work, balancing intense focus with a busy life. He spent time in a retreat for deep work but was active in Zurich, showing that productivity can thrive with dedicated time for both deep and shallow tasks.",
