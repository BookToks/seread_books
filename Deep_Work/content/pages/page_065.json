For example, Jung needed his job to pay the bills and the coffeehouse scene in Zurich to inspire his ideas. Switching between these two modes helps him handle both needs effectively.\n\nA modern example of this bimodal philosophy is Adam Grant, a professor at Wharton Business School. He has talked about how he manages his work habits. During his fast rise in the academic world, he organized his classes so he could focus on deep work in one semester. In those deep work semesters, he would take a few days once or twice a month to completely shut himself off from distractions. He would close his door, set an out-of-office reply on his email, and work on his research without interruptions. When he wasn’t in deep work mode, Grant was very open and easy to reach. He even wrote a bestselling book, *Give and Take*, which encourages people to give their time and attention without expecting anything back as a way to get ahead in their careers.\n\nPeople who use the bimodal philosophy of deep work admire how productive those who focus deeply can be, but they also see the benefits of lighter tasks in their jobs. One big challenge to using this philosophy is that even short periods of deep work need a level of flexibility that many people worry they don’t have. If just being away from your email for an hour makes you anxious, then the idea of being unavailable for a day or more seems impossible. But I think bimodal working can fit into more jobs than you might think. For example, a study by Harvard Business School professor Leslie Perlow showed that a group of management consultants were asked to disconnect for one full day each week. They were scared their clients would get upset, but it turned out the clients didn’t mind at all. As Jung, Grant, and Perlow’s subjects found out, people usually respect your need to be unavailable if you plan these times well and let others know about them. Outside of these focused periods, you can still be easily reached.\n\nIn the early days of the *Seinfeld* show, Jerry Seinfeld was a working comic with...\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The bimodal philosophy helps people balance serious work with lighter activities. Adam Grant is a modern example, using deep work periods to boost productivity. Studies show that with proper planning, people can disconnect without negative consequences.",
