  "simplified_text": "“undoubtedly true”: This is a quote from Jim Manzi’s review of Piketty’s book in the National Review, published on July 7, 2014. I found the mention of Piketty in this review.\n\nThe Principle of Least Resistance: At first, the team didn’t want to do something that could risk their jobs. They wanted to make sure they delivered a better product to the client. You can read more about Leslie Perlow’s research on this in her article in the Harvard Business Review from October 2009. For more information on David Allen’s task management system, check out his book, \"Getting Things Done,\" published in 2001. You can also find his task management flowchart online.\n\nBusyness as a Proxy for Productivity: The h-index is a way to measure how successful an academic is. It’s the highest number x that means they have published at least x papers that have been cited x times. This shows both how many papers they’ve written and how often others reference them. You can’t just write a lot of low-quality papers or a few popular ones to get a high score. This number usually increases as someone progresses in their career, which is why many fields set h-index goals for certain career milestones.\n\n“To do real good physics work”: This quote comes from a 1981 TV interview with Richard Feynman on the BBC. The interview was also shown in the U.S. on NOVA. I watched it on YouTube, but it was taken down due to copyright issues. You can find transcripts of the important parts on various websites.\n\n“Managers themselves inhabit a bewildering psychic landscape”: This quote is from Matthew Crawford’s book, \"Shop Class as Soulcraft,\" published in 2009. The phrase “cranking widgets” is a common metaphor used in discussions about David Allen’s task management system. There are several articles and podcasts that talk about this idea.\n\nMore on Marissa Mayer’s working-from-home prohibition: There’s an article by Nicholas Carlson that explains how Marissa Mayer figured out that some employees at Yahoo were slacking off while working from home.\n\nThe Cult of the Internet: Alissa Rubin tweets at @Alissanyt. I don’t have proof that she was pressured to tweet, but it’s a common concern in today’s work culture.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** This passage discusses various topics like productivity, task management, and the pressures of modern work culture. It references several authors and their works, explaining concepts like the h-index and the challenges faced by managers and employees in today's environment.",
