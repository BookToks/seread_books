  "text": "The CEO of a $40 billion company shared a vague value statement that included common ideals like passion and innovation, which offered no real guidance for employees facing tough choices. In contrast, Johnson & Johnson's Credo provides a clear hierarchy of values, prioritizing customer safety over profits. This clarity helped the company make a difficult decision during a crisis, demonstrating the importance of having defined values.\n\nThe CEO's value statement lacked specificity and failed to help employees navigate conflicting priorities. When faced with a crisis, such as the Tylenol tampering incident, Johnson & Johnson relied on their Credo, which clearly outlined their commitment to customer safety above all else. This prioritization allowed them to make a difficult yet necessary decision to recall their product, despite the significant financial loss it would incur. Having a well-defined set of values can guide organizations through complex situations, ensuring that they make choices aligned with their core principles.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A clear prioritization of values, as exemplified by Johnson & Johnson's Credo, is essential for making difficult trade-off decisions in organizations."
