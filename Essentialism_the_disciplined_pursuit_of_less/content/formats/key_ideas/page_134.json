  "text": "Investing too much time or money into a project can lead to a sunk-cost bias, where people feel compelled to continue despite knowing it may not succeed. This mindset makes it difficult to admit mistakes and consider other options. It's important to recognize these traps and learn how to gracefully exit a situation without incurring further losses.\n\nThe sunk-cost bias occurs when individuals struggle to let go of a failing project because they’ve already invested significant resources. This feeling can cloud judgment, making it hard to see that continuing may lead to more losses. Recognizing this bias is crucial for making rational decisions. Instead of clinging to past investments, it’s healthier to assess the current situation and potential future outcomes. By learning to cut losses, you can redirect your time and resources toward more promising opportunities, ensuring that past mistakes don’t dictate your future choices.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sunk-cost bias can lead to a reluctance to abandon failing projects, making it essential to recognize and avoid this and other commitment traps."
