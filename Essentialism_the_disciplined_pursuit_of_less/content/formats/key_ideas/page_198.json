By stopping to breathe deeply and let go of work-related thoughts, he can be more present with his family. This practice aligns with mindfulness principles, which encourage living in the moment and recognizing happiness in simple experiences.\n\nRodgers' technique of pausing allows him to leave work behind and engage fully with his family. This brief moment of deep breathing serves as a mental reset, helping him to focus on what truly matters at home. Similarly, Thich Nhat Hanh highlights the value of mindfulness, suggesting that being fully present in everyday activities, like drinking tea, enhances our experience of life. By recognizing and writing down moments of clarity throughout the day, we can better understand what distracts us and cultivate a greater sense of presence in our lives.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The concept of \"the pause that refreshes\" emphasizes the importance of taking a moment to clear one's mind of work-related thoughts to be fully present with family and in the moment."
