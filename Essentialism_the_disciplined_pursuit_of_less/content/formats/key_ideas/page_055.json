  "text": "Trade-offs are essential in decision-making, as they force us to prioritize what truly matters. Instead of trying to do everything, we should focus on what we can excel in and be willing to let go of less important options. This approach leads to more meaningful outcomes in our lives.\n\nWhen we face choices, we often feel the pressure to balance multiple aspects, like family, friends, health, and work. A humorous analogy compares our lives to a four-burner stove, where each burner represents a different priority. To achieve success, we might need to turn down or even turn off some burners. This doesnâ€™t mean we must sacrifice important areas of our lives, but rather that we should thoughtfully consider which priorities deserve our attention at any given moment. Embracing trade-offs allows us to make better decisions and ultimately lead a more fulfilling life.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Trade-offs should be embraced and made deliberately to achieve desired outcomes."
