  "text": "To achieve progress, it's crucial to identify and remove obstacles that hinder completion. This may involve addressing slow-moving individuals such as a hesitant boss or unresponsive clients. By approaching these people with a helpful attitude rather than making demands, you can foster cooperation and find solutions together. \n\nRecognizing and eliminating barriers can lead to significant improvements in productivity. Think of it like pushing a boulder down a hill; a small effort can create momentum that makes everything easier. For instance, when faced with challenges at home, a couple realized that by carving out time for planning, they could engage more fully with their children.
