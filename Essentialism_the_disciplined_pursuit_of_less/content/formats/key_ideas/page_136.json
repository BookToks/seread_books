  "text": "Instead of focusing on the value of what we own, we should consider how much we would pay for it if we didn’t already possess it. This shift in perspective can help us evaluate opportunities and commitments more objectively. By asking ourselves how much we would sacrifice for something we don’t have, we can make better decisions without being influenced by the endowment effect.\n\nTo overcome the endowment effect, we can reframe our thinking about ownership. Instead of clinging to what we have, we can assess the true value of opportunities by imagining we don’t own them. This approach helps us avoid being trapped by our past investments. For instance, if we have two ski trip tickets but prefer one, we might still choose the more expensive option just to avoid feeling like we wasted money. Recognizing this bias can free us to make choices that align with our current preferences rather than being shackled by past decisions.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To counter the endowment effect, we should evaluate items and opportunities as if we do not own them, focusing on their true value rather than our attachment."
