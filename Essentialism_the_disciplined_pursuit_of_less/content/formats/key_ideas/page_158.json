  "text": "In this chapter, the story of Joseph from the Hebrew Bible illustrates the importance of preparation and foresight. Joseph interpreted Pharaoh's dream, predicting seven years of abundance followed by seven years of famine. He advised the Pharaoh to store a portion of the harvest during the plentiful years to create a buffer for the future, which ultimately saved Egypt and his family during the famine.\n\nThis narrative emphasizes the value of creating a buffer to handle life's uncertainties. Just like Joseph prepared for the unexpected famine, we should set aside resources, time, or energy to cushion against unforeseen challenges. In a world where unpredictability is the norm, having a buffer allows us to navigate difficulties more smoothly. Itâ€™s about being proactive rather than reactive, ensuring we are ready for whatever comes our way. This approach not only aids in execution but also fosters resilience in the face of adversity.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialists create buffers to prepare for the unpredictable challenges of life, ensuring effortless execution of their plans."
