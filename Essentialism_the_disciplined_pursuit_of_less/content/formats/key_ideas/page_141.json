  "text": "Editing is often overlooked, yet it plays a crucial role in filmmaking. While the \"Best Picture\" award receives much attention, the award for film editing is equally important, as many winning films have been nominated for it. Michael Kahn, a highly respected film editor, has worked on numerous acclaimed movies but remains relatively unknown to the general public. This highlights how editing is considered an \"invisible art\" that focuses on removing unnecessary elements to enhance the final product.\n\nEditing is essential because it shapes the viewer's experience by cutting out what doesnâ€™t serve the story. Just like a sculptor removes excess marble to reveal a statue, a skilled editor eliminates distractions, ensuring that only the most impactful scenes remain. This process is often unnoticed, but it is vital for creating a cohesive narrative. The success of a film often hinges on the editor's ability to make tough decisions about what to keep and what to cut, underscoring the importance of this craft in filmmaking.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Film editing, often overlooked, is a crucial \"invisible art\" that embodies the Essentialist principle of eliminating the trivial to highlight what truly matters."
