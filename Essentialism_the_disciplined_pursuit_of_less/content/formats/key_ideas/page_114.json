  "text": "People often get sidetracked by their personal interests when there’s no clear direction, which can undermine the team's long-term goals. Although their intentions may be good, these individual pursuits can lead to a lack of cohesion and progress. Without a unified purpose, even well-meaning efforts can end up being counterproductive, preventing meaningful contributions.\n\nWhen teams lack clear direction, members may focus on their own short-term objectives rather than the collective mission. This can result in a mix of conflicting activities that don’t effectively move the team forward. Similarly, individuals juggling multiple good activities may find they don’t contribute to a significant goal, akin to pursuing various majors without completing a degree. Clarity of purpose is essential; without it, good intentions alone cannot yield impactful results. As Emerson noted, straying from a main goal leads to wasted efforts.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Without clear direction, individuals and teams may pursue well-intentioned activities that ultimately detract from their long-term mission and contributions."
