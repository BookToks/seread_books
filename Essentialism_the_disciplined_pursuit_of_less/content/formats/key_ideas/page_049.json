  "text": "Southwest Airlines, under Herb Kelleher's leadership, achieved remarkable financial success by making intentional trade-offs in their business strategy. Instead of trying to do everything, they focused on a few key choices, like offering only point-to-point flights and eliminating costly services like meals and assigned seating. This deliberate approach helped them maintain low costs and stand out in a challenging industry.\n\nHerb Kelleher's strategy for Southwest Airlines illustrates the power of making clear choices. By deciding what to exclude rather than trying to cater to every customer preference, the airline streamlined its operations and kept prices low. For instance, they chose not to serve meals or offer first-class service, which allowed them to focus on efficiency and customer satisfaction in a different way. This approach not only set them apart from competitors but also ensured that their resources were directed toward what truly mattered, leading to consistent profitability.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Herb Kelleher's Essentialist approach at Southwest Airlines involved deliberate trade-offs to maintain low costs and achieve consistent financial success."
