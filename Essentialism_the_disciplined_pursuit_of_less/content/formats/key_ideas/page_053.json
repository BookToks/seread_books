  "text": "We cannot avoid making trade-offs in life, as they are a necessary part of decision-making. An executive team struggled to prioritize their projects, with one manager insisting on too many priorities. This led to spreading resources too thin and not achieving desired results. Essentialists recognize that they cannot have everything and focus on choosing what matters most.\n\nTrade-offs are a reality we all face, whether in work or personal life. When we try to juggle too many priorities, like a manager who wanted to tackle eighteen projects, we often fail to achieve meaningful results. Instead of asking how to do it all, Essentialists ask which priority truly matters. This approach allows them to make intentional choices and focus their efforts where they will have the most impact. Acknowledging that we cannot have everything frees us to pursue what truly aligns with our goals.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Trade-offs are an unavoidable reality that require deliberate decision-making to prioritize effectively."
