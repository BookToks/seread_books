  "text": "Essentialists tend to say \"no\" more often than they use the actual word. They find various polite ways to decline requests while clearly communicating their limits. Understanding what they give up by saying \"yes\" makes it easier for them to refuse, as they recognize the value of their time. Additionally, being aware that everyone is trying to persuade them helps them make more thoughtful decisions about how to spend their time.\n\nTo effectively say \"no,\" Essentialists often use alternative phrases that convey their unavailability without directly rejecting the request. This approach allows them to maintain politeness while protecting their time. Recognizing the opportunity cost of saying \"yes\" helps them prioritize better and avoid overcommitting. Furthermore, they realize that saying \"no\" can sometimes lead to a temporary dip in popularity, but it ultimately earns them respect as they assert the value of their time and commitments.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialists often say \"no\" gracefully by recognizing the trade-offs involved and understanding that everyone is seeking to exchange something for their time."
