  "text": "Changing routines doesn't require altering behaviors directly; instead, it's about identifying the cues that trigger nonessential actions and linking them to essential activities. For example, if passing a bakery leads you to buy a doughnut, use that moment to remind yourself to pick up something healthier. With practice, these new associations become automatic.\n\nTo effectively change behaviors, we can create new cues that prompt essential routines. For instance, the author struggled with maintaining a journaling habit until he placed his journal next to his phone. This simple adjustment allowed the sight of his phone to trigger the action of writing, making it a natural part of his daily routine. Over time, this practice became instinctive and enjoyable, demonstrating how small changes in cues can lead to significant habit formation.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To change nonessential routines, we should identify and modify the cues triggering those behaviors, associating them with essential activities instead."
