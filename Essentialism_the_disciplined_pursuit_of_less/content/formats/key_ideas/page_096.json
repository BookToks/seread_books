  "text": "The main idea is about making better choices by being more selective. By applying a strict test to decisions, we can determine what we truly want to pursue and what to reject. This approach helps clarify our priorities and focus on what matters most.\n\nTo make choices that align with our true desires, we need a method to filter out options. One effective technique is to ask ourselves if we feel a strong, enthusiastic \"yes\" about a decision. If we don’t feel that level of excitement, it’s better to say no. This strategy encourages us to only engage in activities that genuinely resonate with us, leading to a more fulfilling life. By setting high standards for our commitments, we can avoid spreading ourselves too thin and concentrate on what brings us joy and purpose.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** We must become more selective in our choices by applying extreme criteria to determine what truly deserves our commitment."
