  "text": "Boundaries can often feel restrictive, but they can actually provide freedom. By establishing clear rules ahead of time, we can avoid the need to say \"no\" directly, making it easier to manage our time and commitments.\n\nWhen we think of boundaries as limitations, we may resist setting them, fearing they will confine us. However, viewing boundaries as a form of liberation allows us to take control of our lives. By defining our limits in advance, we create a framework that helps us navigate demands on our time without feeling guilty or overwhelmed. This proactive approach not only protects our personal space but also simplifies decision-making, allowing us to focus on what truly matters to us.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Boundaries can be perceived as either constraining or liberating, with the latter allowing for pre-established rules that reduce the need for direct refusals."
