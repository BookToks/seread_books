  "text": "Seven students were asked how long they believed their senior thesis would take to complete. When estimating under ideal conditions, they predicted an average of 27.4 days. However, when considering worst-case scenarios, their estimate rose to 48.6 days, while the actual time taken was 55.5 days. Only 30% managed to finish within their initial estimates. This tendency to underestimate time is often influenced by social pressure, leading to delays in various tasks. To counter this, adding a 50% time buffer to estimates can help reduce stress and improve time management.\n\nPeople often misjudge how long tasks will take, usually underestimating due to a mix of optimism and social expectations. This can lead to frustration, as we frequently find ourselves late for meetings or tasks. A practical solution is to add a time bufferâ€”essentially increasing our estimates by 50%. This not only alleviates the pressure of running late but also allows for a pleasant surprise if tasks take less time than anticipated. By planning this way, we can create a more relaxed and effective execution of our responsibilities.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** People tend to underestimate the time required to complete tasks due to social pressure and the planning fallacy, leading to frequent delays."
