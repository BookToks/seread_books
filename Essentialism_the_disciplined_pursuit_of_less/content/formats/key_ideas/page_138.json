  "text": "The main idea is that we often continue with commitments simply because we've always done so, a phenomenon known as status quo bias. This can lead to wasted time and resources. To combat this, we can use a method called zero-based budgeting, which requires us to justify every commitment from scratch rather than relying on past decisions.\n\nTo fully understand these concepts, consider how easy it is to stick with outdated practices just because theyâ€™re familiar. Many organizations fall into this trap, failing to question longstanding systems. Zero-based budgeting offers a solution by forcing a fresh evaluation of every commitment. Instead of assuming that past choices were correct, this method requires a thorough justification for each item, ensuring resources are allocated based on current needs. This approach not only highlights unnecessary commitments but also sharpens focus on objectives and their alignment with expenses.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Admitting mistakes and questioning established commitments can liberate us from nonessential investments and improve decision-making."
