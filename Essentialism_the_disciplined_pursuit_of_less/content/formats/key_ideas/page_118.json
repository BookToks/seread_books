  "text": "To effectively coordinate efforts and energy, teams need a clear purpose that allows everyone to assess new ideas based on their alignment with that purpose. This clarity fosters greater contributions and collaboration, even if the ultimate goal isnâ€™t fully achieved. Crafting a statement of purpose should focus on substance over style, avoiding trivial word choices that lead to vague statements. Instead, teams should ask what they would excel at if they could only focus on one thing. Inspiration is important, but it should be grounded in concrete objectives that define success.\n\nA clear purpose empowers teams by ensuring everyone understands how their actions contribute to a common goal. When everyone can evaluate new ideas against this purpose, it promotes a culture of accountability and collaboration. Crafting a meaningful statement of purpose requires prioritizing clarity and substance over stylistic concerns. By focusing on what truly matters and asking what one thing they want to excel at, teams can create a powerful intent that motivates action. This intent should also include measurable objectives, allowing teams to recognize when they have succeeded.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** An essential intent is a clear and inspiring statement of purpose that guides decision-making and aligns actions towards a meaningful goal."
