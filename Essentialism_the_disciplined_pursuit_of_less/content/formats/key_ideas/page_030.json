  "text": "The principle of “less but better” emphasizes the importance of being selective about our actions. By eliminating nonessential tasks, we gain freedom and power to focus on what truly matters. This shift can lead to greater contributions not just in our personal lives, but also in our communities and workplaces.\n\nWhen we prioritize quality over quantity, we unlock new possibilities for achievement. Imagine schools that focus on meaningful projects instead of busywork, or businesses that eliminate pointless meetings to foster creativity. This mindset encourages us to reject societal pressures to accumulate more and instead cherish the value of simplicity. By celebrating meaningful interactions and thoughtful reflection, we can transform our lives and the world around us into a space for genuine growth and fulfillment.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The principle of \"less but better\" empowers individuals to eliminate nonessentials and focus on their highest contributions, leading to greater freedom and achievement."
