  "text": "Trade-offs are a crucial aspect of decision-making that can lead to significant opportunities. When we carefully weigh our options and make strategic choices, we enhance our chances of achieving our desired outcomes. Essentialists view trade-offs positively, focusing on what they want to prioritize rather than what they must give up.\n\nEssentialists recognize that every choice involves a trade-off, which can be beneficial. For example, a parent might decide to withdraw their child from an activity that isnâ€™t a strong fit to focus on their goal of getting them accepted to a prestigious school. Similarly, a couple may choose not to engage in social clubs to spend more quality time with their children, strengthening their family bond. By shifting the mindset from loss to opportunity, Essentialists can make more meaningful choices and achieve greater success in their personal and professional lives.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialists view trade-offs as opportunities for strategic decision-making to achieve their desired outcomes."
