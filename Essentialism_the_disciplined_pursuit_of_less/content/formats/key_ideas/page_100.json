  "text": "Mark Adams, managing director of Vitsoe, has spent years applying selective criteria in his work. Vitsoe, known for its singular focus on the 606 Universal Shelving System, prioritizes quality over quantity in both its products and hiring practices. They prefer to be understaffed rather than hire unsuitable candidates quickly, employing a rigorous selection process that involves multiple interviews and team feedback to ensure a perfect fit.\n\nVitsoe's approach highlights the importance of being selective in both product offerings and hiring. By focusing on one exceptional product, they embody the \"less but better\" philosophy. Their hiring process is designed to ensure that only the best candidates are chosen, with an emphasis on team compatibility. This thorough vetting allows both the company and potential employees to assess fit without pressure, fostering a culture where everyone is aligned and motivated to contribute effectively.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Vitsoe exemplifies the Essentialist principle of \"less but better\" by maintaining selective hiring practices and focusing on a single, high-quality product."
