  "text": "The Essentialist approach focuses on creating routines that prioritize what truly matters, making it easier to achieve essential goals. While hard work is still necessary at times, having the right routine allows efforts to produce significantly better results. \n\nEssentialists differ from nonessentialists by intentionally designing their routines to prioritize essential tasks. Instead of forcing themselves to focus on whatâ€™s important, they establish a system where essential actions become automatic. This means that, over time, what is truly important becomes the standard way of operating, requiring less mental effort to maintain. By making essential tasks the default, they can achieve more with less struggle, leading to greater efficiency and effectiveness in pursuing their goals.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The Essentialist creates a routine that prioritizes essential tasks, making their execution nearly effortless."
