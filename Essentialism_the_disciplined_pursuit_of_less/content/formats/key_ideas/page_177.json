  "text": "The implementation of a system that rewards minimal effort can lead to significant positive changes. By encouraging small, manageable progress, nonessential activities decrease while essential tasks increase. This approach can be applied both at home and work, focusing on celebrating small wins to foster motivation.\n\nCreating systems that emphasize minimal viable progress helps streamline efforts toward important goals. Instead of striving for perfection, itâ€™s more effective to ask what the smallest step forward is that can still add value. This method mirrors practices in creative industries, where initial ideas are tested and refined through feedback, allowing for quick learning and adaptation with minimal effort. By starting small and iterating, we can achieve meaningful results without overwhelming ourselves.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Investing small initial efforts in creating systems can lead to significant reductions in nonessential activities and increases in essential activities."
