  "text": "To achieve our goals, whether at work or in personal life, we often view execution as a challenging task that requires effort. However, the Essentialist perspective suggests that instead of forcing things to happen, we should focus on creating systems that remove obstacles and simplify the execution process. The steps of exploring, eliminating, and executing are interconnected and should be applied continuously for the best results.\n\nThe Essentialist approach transforms how we think about achieving our goals. Rather than seeing execution as a struggle, it encourages us to build systems that streamline our efforts. By identifying and removing barriers, we can make the process smoother and more efficient. This means that the steps of exploring what’s essential, eliminating what’s not, and executing our plans work together in a cycle. By consistently applying this method, we can enhance our productivity and achieve better outcomes with less friction.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The Essentialist approach focuses on creating systems to remove obstacles and simplify execution rather than forcing it."
