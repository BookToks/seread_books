  "text": "To enhance focus and creativity, it’s beneficial to set aside time for deep thinking and reading. Bill Gates exemplifies this by dedicating a week twice a year to read and reflect, even during busy periods. For those unable to commit to a full week, incorporating a daily practice of reading classic literature for just twenty minutes can help center thoughts and broaden perspectives.\n\nCreating space for deep thought is essential for personal and professional growth. Bill Gates’ “Think Week” shows how stepping away from daily tasks can lead to greater insights and clarity. If a full week feels unmanageable, consider carving out a short daily routine, such as reading a classic book each morning. This practice not only prevents distractions like checking emails but also enriches your mind with timeless ideas, encouraging you to reflect on what truly matters in life. Engaging with enduring literature can shift your viewpoint and inspire deeper thinking.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Creating dedicated time for reflection and reading, as exemplified by Bill Gates' \"Think Week,\" can enhance focus and broaden perspective amidst daily distractions."
