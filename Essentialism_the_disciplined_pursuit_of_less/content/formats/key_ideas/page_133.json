  "text": "The sunk-cost bias can trap individuals into continuing with losing investments because they have already spent money or time that cannot be recovered. This often leads to a cycle where the more one invests, the harder it becomes to let go. Essentialists recognize this trap and have the confidence to cut their losses, while nonessentialists struggle to move on despite the costs incurred.\n\nUnderstanding the sunk-cost bias helps clarify why we often stick with poor choices, like watching a bad movie or pouring money into a failing project. The more we invest, the more we feel compelled to see it through, even when itâ€™s clear we should walk away. Essentialists, however, can break free from this cycle. They assess situations without the weight of past investments and choose to uncommit when necessary, allowing them to redirect their resources toward more valuable pursuits.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sunk-cost bias leads individuals to continue investing in losing propositions, while Essentialists have the courage to cut their losses and uncommit."
