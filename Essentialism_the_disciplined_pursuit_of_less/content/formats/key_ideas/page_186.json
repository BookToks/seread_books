  "text": "Many of our daily choices are made unconsciously, which can lead to both good and bad habits. While we can develop beneficial routines, we often fall into nonessential habits that waste our time and energy. To change these habits, we need to identify the cues that trigger them and replace them with cues that promote more essential behaviors.\n\nChanging habits can feel overwhelmingly difficult because of the strong pull of our established routines. Each habit consists of a cue that activates it, the routine itself, and a reward that reinforces it. Understanding this cycle helps us recognize how to replace nonessential habits with more productive ones by focusing on the triggers that initiate them.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Our unconscious choices can lead to both unproductive routines and the opportunity to develop new, instinctive abilities."
