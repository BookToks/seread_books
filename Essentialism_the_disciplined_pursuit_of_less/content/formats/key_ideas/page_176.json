  "text": "The Stanford prison experiment showed how quickly people can adapt to roles of power and submission, leading to negative behaviors. This raises the question of whether similar conditioning could promote positive actions. Philip Zimbardo's Heroic Imagination Project aims to teach heroism principles to encourage courageous behavior, suggesting that we can design systems that make good actions easier to perform.\n\nZimbardo's experiment illustrates how environment and expectations shape behavior. Just as students quickly took on the roles of prisoners and guards, we can harness that same principle to foster positive actions. By creating systems that reward good behavior, like the token system used by the author's family to limit screen time, we can encourage children to engage in more productive activities. This approach shifts the focus from policing undesirable behavior to promoting and rewarding positive choices, ultimately making goodness a natural part of daily life.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The Stanford prison experiment illustrates how conditioning can lead to negative behaviors, prompting the idea that similar methods could foster positive actions through structured systems."
