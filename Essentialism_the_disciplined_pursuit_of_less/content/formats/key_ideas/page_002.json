It encourages individuals to make deliberate choices about where to invest their time and energy, leading to greater fulfillment and effectiveness.\n\n**Explanation**  \nEssentialism is about cutting through the noise of everyday life to focus on what is genuinely important. It teaches that not every opportunity or demand deserves our attention. By honing in on what aligns with our values and goals, we can make better choices that enhance our lives. Imagine a cluttered room; by removing unnecessary items, you create space for what you truly love. Similarly, when we eliminate distractions and non-essential tasks, we free ourselves to pursue meaningful activities that lead to satisfaction and success. This disciplined approach enables us to live with intention and purpose.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The book \"Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less\" by Greg McKeown emphasizes the importance of focusing on what truly matters by eliminating the non-essential."
