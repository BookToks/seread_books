  "text": "Saying no is a crucial skill for those who want to focus on what truly matters. It’s important to have different ways to decline requests gracefully, whether it’s by explaining the need to prioritize other commitments or using humor. By responding thoughtfully, you can maintain respect for both your time and the other person's needs.\n\nMastering the art of saying no can free you to concentrate on your most important tasks. When faced with a request, consider how accepting it might impact your ability to fulfill existing responsibilities. For instance, you might ask a superior which projects you should set aside to accommodate a new task, highlighting the trade-offs involved. Alternatively, you can use humor or frame your response to show willingness in a limited way, like offering help without taking on the full burden. This approach fosters mutual respect and keeps your priorities in focus.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialists develop a repertoire of responses to gracefully say no to requests that compromise their priorities."
