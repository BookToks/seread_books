  "text": "The main idea is that many people underestimate the time and effort needed for tasks, leading to rushed or incomplete work. In contrast, Essentialists plan ahead, anticipate challenges, and build in extra time to handle unexpected issues, ensuring better outcomes.\n\nEssentialists take a proactive approach by preparing for potential setbacks and creating a buffer for unforeseen circumstances. This means they donâ€™t just hope for the best but instead expect challenges and plan accordingly. For instance, while a Nonessentialist might spend a sudden financial gain right away, an Essentialist would save and invest it to protect against future difficulties. This foresight allows Essentialists to maintain high performance even when surprises arise, contrasting sharply with those who react only when problems occur.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The Essentialist prepares for the unexpected by planning ahead and creating buffers, while the Nonessentialist assumes the best-case scenario and reacts to problems as they arise."
