  "text": "One key insight into forgetting our ability to choose comes from research on \"learned helplessness\" by Martin Seligman and Steve Maier. They found that dogs who experienced shocks but could control them learned to escape, while those who faced uncontrollable shocks became passive and did nothing to avoid pain. This illustrates how a lack of control can lead to a belief that one has no options.\n\nSeligman and Maier's experiments reveal how we can lose sight of our choices. The dogs that could stop their shocks learned to take action when faced with a new situation, while those that were powerless became resigned and did not try to escape. This parallels human behavior; when we repeatedly encounter situations where we feel we lack control, we may stop seeking solutions altogether. Understanding this can help us recognize our inherent ability to choose and take action in difficult circumstances.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** We often forget our ability to choose due to experiences of learned helplessness, as demonstrated in experiments with dogs."
