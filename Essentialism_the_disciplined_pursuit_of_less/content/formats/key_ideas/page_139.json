  "text": "You can use zero-based budgeting in your own life by starting fresh with your time and commitments. Instead of sticking to what youâ€™ve always done, evaluate what truly deserves your attention and energy. If something no longer fits your priorities, it's time to let it go. \n\nTo effectively manage your commitments, treat each one as if it needs to earn its place in your life. This means actively choosing what to keep or discard rather than passively accepting obligations. Many people unintentionally fill their schedules with casual commitments made in conversations. By pausing before agreeing to new tasks, you can better assess their importance. If you find yourself regretting a commitment, it's okay to politely withdraw. Overcoming the fear of missing out can help you focus on what truly matters and avoid unnecessary obligations.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Applying zero-based budgeting to personal commitments encourages starting from scratch to evaluate and eliminate nonessential obligations."
