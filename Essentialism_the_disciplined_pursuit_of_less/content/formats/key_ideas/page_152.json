  "text": "Their problems can often become our own, especially when people in our lives demand our time and attention without regard for our boundaries. This can distract us from our own goals and drain our energy. It's important to recognize when helping someone is actually enabling them, as taking on their issues prevents them from finding their own solutions.\n\nSetting boundaries is crucial in both personal and professional relationships. When we allow others to impose their agendas on us, we risk losing focus on what truly matters to us. Like a neighbor who constantly borrows tools but never returns them, we can become burdened by others' problems if we don't establish limits. By doing so, we not only protect our time and energy but also encourage others to address their own challenges, fostering independence and growth.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Setting boundaries is essential to prevent others from making their problems our own and to maintain focus on our own priorities."
