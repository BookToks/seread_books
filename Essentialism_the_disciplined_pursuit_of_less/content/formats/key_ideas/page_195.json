  "text": "Multitasking and multifocusing are different concepts. While multitasking refers to doing multiple activities simultaneously, it is possible to perform tasks together, like listening to music while cleaning. However, true focus requires concentrating on one task at a time. The author shares an experience where a former classmate was distracted by his phone during a conversation, making it clear that being present in mind is essential for meaningful interactions.\n\nThe distinction between multitasking and multifocusing is crucial for understanding how we engage with tasks and people. Multitasking allows us to juggle simple activities, but it doesn't enable genuine concentration. For instance, you can wash dishes while listening to music, but if youâ€™re trying to engage deeply with someone while texting, you lose the essence of the conversation. Being present means dedicating your mental energy to one thing, ensuring that your interactions are meaningful and your work is effective. This focus is what truly drives success in both personal and professional settings.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialists prioritize being focused on one task at a time rather than attempting to multitask, which leads to greater presence and effectiveness."
