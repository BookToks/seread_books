  "text": "The right moment to say \"no\" can significantly influence events, as demonstrated by Rosa Parks's refusal to give up her bus seat, which played a crucial role in the civil rights movement. Her decision stemmed from a strong personal conviction rather than an assertive personality. Parks's experience shows that understanding what is essential to us can empower us to stand firm against pressure.\n\nRosa Parks's act of defiance on that bus was a pivotal moment in history, showing how a simple \"no\" can spark change. Unlike what many might expect, her courage did not come from being naturally assertive; instead, it arose from a profound sense of purpose. She felt a strong determination to stand against humiliation, which made her willing to face arrest. While most of us may never encounter such extreme circumstances, we can still draw strength from her example when we need to assert our own values and say no to nonessential demands.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The power of a well-timed \"no,\" exemplified by Rosa Parks, can significantly influence history and inspire others to stand firm in their convictions."
