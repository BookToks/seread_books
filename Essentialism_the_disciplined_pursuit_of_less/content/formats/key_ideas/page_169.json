  "text": "Instead of simply adding more resources to achieve goals, Essentialists believe in producing better results by removing unnecessary obstacles. This approach emphasizes clarity about desired outcomes to identify what needs to be eliminated. By focusing on constraints rather than just increasing efforts, one can work more efficiently and effectively.\n\nTo truly improve results, it's important to understand what you want to achieve first. Without a clear goal, any changes made can feel random and ineffective. By defining what success looks like, you can pinpoint specific barriers that hinder progress. This method shifts the focus from simply doing more to strategically eliminating what is unnecessary, allowing for a more streamlined and productive execution.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** An Essentialist achieves greater results by focusing on removing obstacles rather than adding more efforts."
