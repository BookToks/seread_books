  "text": "Being selective about which opportunities to pursue can be challenging, especially when unexpected offers arise. The temptation to say yes to easy rewards can lead to missing out on more meaningful options later. Nancy Duarte's experience illustrates this; by focusing on a niche—designing presentations—rather than accepting various unrelated projects, her agency became a leader in that field. \n\nTo effectively navigate opportunities, it's crucial to filter them based on clear criteria. Start by identifying minimum requirements for what you will consider. Then, establish ideal standards for what would make an opportunity truly worthwhile. This process helps ensure that you prioritize meaningful engagements over tempting but less significant offers, allowing you to concentrate your efforts on what truly matters and can lead to greater success.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Being selective about opportunities is crucial to avoid diluting focus and to excel in a chosen specialty."
