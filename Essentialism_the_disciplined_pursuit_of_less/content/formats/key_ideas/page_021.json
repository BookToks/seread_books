  "text": "The struggle to prioritize can lead to feeling overwhelmed when we try to manage too many commitments. If we donâ€™t intentionally choose where to focus our time and energy, we risk allowing others to dictate our lives. This can result in regrets about not living authentically, emphasizing the need to eliminate nonessential tasks and make room for what truly matters.\n\nOur lives can become cluttered with obligations, much like an unorganized closet filled with clothes we rarely wear. Without a deliberate strategy for prioritization, we may find ourselves stuck with too many commitments, leading to frustration and dissatisfaction. By consciously deciding what to keep and what to eliminate, we can simplify our lives and focus on what is genuinely important, avoiding the pitfalls of regret and disconnection from our true selves.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To live a meaningful life, we must deliberately eliminate nonessentials and focus on what truly matters, rather than allowing others to dictate our priorities."
