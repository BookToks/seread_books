  "text": "Essentialists prioritize hiring the right people and focus on removing obstacles to foster team success. They avoid the chaos of hiring too many unsuitable candidates, which can dilute a team's effectiveness. Instead, they are selective and ensure every team member contributes positively to the group's goals.\n\nBy being highly selective in hiring, Essentialists build strong teams that excel together. Nonessentialists, on the other hand, often hire hastily, leading to a mix of talents that may hinder progress. This chaotic approach can result in a team that barely advances in any direction. In contrast, Essentialists take the time to find the best candidates and are willing to let go of those who don't fit, creating a unified group that thrives and achieves significant results together.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The Essentialist approach to leadership emphasizes being highly selective in hiring to build a unified team of top performers, contrasting with the Nonessentialist tendency to hire impulsively, leading to mediocrity."
