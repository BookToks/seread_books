  "text": "Kelleher’s approach at Southwest Airlines exemplified Essentialist thinking by focusing on what the company was and was not. He emphasized making deliberate trade-offs to avoid distractions that wouldn’t contribute to their goals. While critics doubted this strategy, Southwest's success led competitors to mimic their model, often without fully committing, which ultimately undermined their effectiveness.\n\nKelleher understood that to succeed, Southwest needed to embrace its identity as a low-cost airline and reject unnecessary offerings. This clear focus allowed them to thrive, while competitors like Continental Airlines attempted to adopt similar practices without fully abandoning their existing strategies. By straddling two approaches, Continental failed to achieve the operational efficiencies necessary to compete on price, leading to compromised service quality. This illustrates that a strong strategic position relies on making clear trade-offs rather than diluting focus by trying to do everything.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Southwest Airlines succeeded by making deliberate trade-offs in their strategy, while competitors like Continental Airlines struggled by trying to adopt conflicting approaches."
