  "text": "Essentialists often choose to say \"no\" more frequently than they actually use the word. They can communicate their refusal politely and clearly without being blunt. While there may be short-term social costs to saying no, gaining respect in the long run is far more valuable than seeking popularity.\n\nSaying no can feel uncomfortable, but it is essential for establishing boundaries and valuing one's time. For instance, when graphic designer Paul Rand told Steve Jobs he would only provide one logo solution instead of multiple options, he demonstrated professionalism and confidence. This approach might lead to temporary discontent, but ultimately it earns respect. A definitive \"no\" is often better than vague responses that can lead to misunderstandings and resentment. By embracing the ability to say no gracefully, Essentialists prioritize respect over fleeting popularity.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Saying \"no\" respectfully and clearly is more valuable than vague commitments, as it fosters respect over popularity."
