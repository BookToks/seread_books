  "text": "The effort we put into tasks doesn't always lead to proportional results. Through personal experiences, the author learned that focusing on the most valuable outcomes, rather than just working harder, can yield greater rewards. This principle, known as \"less but better,\" emphasizes the importance of quality over quantity in our efforts.\n\nThe author illustrates this concept through their journey from delivering newspapers to exploring more efficient ways to earn money, such as washing cars. This shift allowed them to maximize their earnings with less effort. Later, while working in customer service, they realized that retaining customers was more valuable than simply clocking hours. By prioritizing impactful results, they achieved success. The example of Ferran Adri√†, a renowned chef, further emphasizes this idea; he simplifies dishes to their essence and limits his restaurant's capacity to focus on quality, showcasing that sometimes doing less can lead to better outcomes.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Effort does not always correlate with results, and focusing on \"less but better\" can yield greater rewards."
