  "text": "To make better choices, we should apply strict criteria to our decisions. If we don't feel a strong, enthusiastic yes about something, we should say no. This approach helps us focus on what truly matters in our lives, leading to more meaningful experiences and opportunities.\n\nUsing extreme criteria allows us to filter out the unnecessary and prioritize what we genuinely value. For example, instead of keeping clothes we might wear someday, asking if we truly love an item helps us declutter our lives. This principle can be applied to various choices, from job candidates to living locations, ensuring we invest our time and energy only in what excites and fulfills us. By adopting this mindset, we create space for better opportunities and experiences.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Using extreme criteria for decision-making helps prioritize what truly matters and eliminate unnecessary clutter in our lives."
