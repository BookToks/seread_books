  "text": "Amundsen's preparation for his journey contrasts sharply with Scott's minimal planning. While Amundsen built in extra time and resources, Scott relied on ideal conditions, leading to disastrous consequences for his team. This highlights the importance of thorough preparation in both exploration and business, as successful companies often acknowledge the unpredictability of challenges and prepare accordingly.\n\nThe story of Amundsen and Scott illustrates a crucial lesson about the dangers of underestimating time and resources. Amundsen's success came from anticipating difficulties and allowing for contingencies, while Scott's reliance on favorable circumstances resulted in tragedy. This principle applies to everyday life and work; many people fall into the \"planning fallacy,\" underestimating how long tasks will take. This can lead to stress and inefficiency, as seen in the example of someone who consistently misjudges travel time. By recognizing the need for buffers in our plans, we can reduce stress and improve our effectiveness.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Amundsen's success in extreme conditions highlights the importance of preparedness and realistic time estimation in achieving goals."
