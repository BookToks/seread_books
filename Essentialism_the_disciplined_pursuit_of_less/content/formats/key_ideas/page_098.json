  "text": "Assigning numerical values to our options helps us make clear and rational decisions instead of acting on impulse. It requires discipline to set strict criteria, but not doing so can be costly. Nonessentialists often rely on vague criteria, such as feeling obligated to take on tasks because someone asked them to. This mindset can lead to overwhelming workloads and a lack of purpose, especially in a world where social media amplifies the pressure to engage in nonessential activities. In contrast, essentialists focus on a select few opportunities that truly align with their goals.\n\nUsing numerical values encourages thoughtful decision-making, steering us away from impulsive choices. Nonessentialists tend to follow unspoken rules, taking on tasks simply because others do. This can lead to burnout and a loss of direction, as team members may feel overwhelmed and disconnected from meaningful work. Essentialists, however, define clear criteria to choose only the most relevant projects, fostering a sense of purpose and helping them stand out in their field.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Nonessentialists make decisions based on implicit criteria, leading to overwhelm and lack of purpose, while essentialists use explicit criteria to focus on the most valuable opportunities."
