  "text": "Applying stricter criteria to major life choices helps us utilize our brain's capabilities more effectively. By focusing on specific questions about passion, talent, and the needs of the world, we can narrow our options. This approach leads us to discover our most significant contributions instead of just settling for good opportunities.\n\nWhen we refine our search for opportunities, we move from a broad inquiry to a targeted one. For instance, instead of asking for a good job, we can ask what truly excites us and where we can make a real impact. This method is exemplified by Enric Sala, who shifted from academia to a role that aligned with his passion for ocean exploration. He prioritized finding a position that allowed him to dive into remote waters and influence global policy, demonstrating that waiting for the right opportunity can lead to fulfilling work that utilizes our unique strengths.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Applying stricter criteria to major life decisions helps individuals identify and pursue their highest contributions."
