  "text": "Sam Elliot, a Silicon Valley executive, realized he was overwhelmed after his company was acquired. He started saying no to requests that didn't align with his priorities, which surprised him by earning him respect rather than disappointment. By being selective about his commitments, he regained control of his time, allowing him to focus on what truly mattered, both at work and at home.\n\nBy evaluating each request against a higher standard, Sam transformed his approach to work. Initially, he felt guilty refusing requests, but he soon discovered that prioritizing his time led to greater respect from colleagues. This newfound selectivity freed him from unnecessary obligations, enabling him to focus on significant projects. As a result, he not only improved his work quality but also reclaimed his personal life, enjoying more time with his family and reducing the stress of constant demands. This shift allowed him to make meaningful progress rather than just minimal advancements in many directions.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** By selectively refusing non-essential requests, Sam Elliot regained control over his time and improved both his work quality and personal life."
