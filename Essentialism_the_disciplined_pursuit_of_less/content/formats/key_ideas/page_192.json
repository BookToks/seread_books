  "text": "Think about how often you get caught up in past mistakes or future worries. Many people spend their time focused on things they can't control instead of what truly matters in the present. The ancient Greeks had two concepts of time: chronos, which is about clock time, and kairos, which refers to the right moment. Living in the now allows us to engage fully with life and prioritize whatâ€™s important.\n\nTo truly live, we need to embrace the present moment rather than being consumed by what has happened or what might come next. While nonessentialists often dwell on past failures or future uncertainties, essentialists concentrate on the here and now. This shift in focus helps us appreciate life more deeply and take meaningful actions. By tuning into the present, we can prioritize what is truly significant and make the most of our time.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Focusing on the present moment is essential for effectively engaging with what truly matters in life."
