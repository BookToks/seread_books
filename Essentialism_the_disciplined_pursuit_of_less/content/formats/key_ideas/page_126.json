  "text": "Essentialists prioritize their commitments by learning to say no to nonessential requests. While many people feel pressured to say yes to avoid social awkwardness, Essentialists recognize that this often leads to regret and resentment. They focus on saying no gracefully to protect their time and energy for what truly matters.\n\nTo say no gracefully, it’s important to separate the request from the relationship. When someone asks for help, it can be easy to feel that denying the request means rejecting the person. By understanding that the decision to decline is about prioritizing one’s own values and responsibilities, individuals can confidently refuse requests while maintaining their relationships. This approach allows them to focus on what is truly important and necessary in their lives.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialists prioritize saying no to nonessentials in order to focus on what truly matters."
