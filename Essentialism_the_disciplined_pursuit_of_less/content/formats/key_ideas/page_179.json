  "text": "Progress is more motivating when we can see it clearly. By starting with small steps and rewarding ourselves for achievements, we can reach our goals more effectively than by aiming for large, unrealistic ones. This approach not only leads to greater success but also enhances our enjoyment of the journey toward our goals.\n\nWhen we begin with manageable tasks, it becomes easier to stay motivated and track our progress. Just like earning a star for cleaning your room encourages continued effort, applying this method to larger objectives can lead to greater accomplishments. The satisfaction from these small wins not only boosts our confidence but also makes the entire process more enjoyable, reinforcing our commitment to achieving our essential goals.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Starting small and rewarding progress leads to greater achievements and increased satisfaction compared to setting lofty goals."
