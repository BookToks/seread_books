  "text": "Stress negatively impacts our ability to think clearly by increasing emotional responses while hindering cognitive functions. Engaging in play can counteract this effect, helping to reduce stress and restore mental clarity. Play also enhances executive functions, which are essential for effective decision-making and problem-solving.\n\nWhen we experience stress, our brain's emotional center becomes overactive, leading to confusion and forgetfulness. However, activities like drawing can quickly alleviate stress, allowing for clearer thinking and exploration. Play nurtures both logical reasoning and creative exploration, which is crucial for innovation. Historically, many significant discoveries, from Columbus's realization about the Earth's shape to Einstein's thought experiments, occurred during playful moments, highlighting the importance of play in fostering creativity and problem-solving skills.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Play enhances cognitive function and creativity, helping to alleviate stress and stimulate innovative thinking."
