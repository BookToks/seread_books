  "text": "Getting accustomed to the concept of \"less but better\" can be challenging, especially since society often rewards us for doing more. However, pushing for more effort can lead to diminishing returns, where progress stalls. Research shows that a small portion of our efforts can yield the majority of our results, as illustrated by the Pareto Principle. This principle highlights that focusing on a few vital tasks can lead to significant improvements, a strategy that has been successfully applied in various fields, including business.\n\nThe idea of focusing on \"the vital few\" rather than \"the trivial many\" is crucial for maximizing effectiveness. Many believe that working harder always leads to better results, but studies suggest otherwise. The Pareto Principle shows that a small percentage of efforts often leads to the majority of outcomes. For instance, Warren Buffett's investment strategy exemplifies this; he chooses only a few investments he believes in strongly, which has resulted in most of his wealth. This approach emphasizes the importance of prioritizing essential tasks to achieve significant success.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The concept of \"less but better\" emphasizes that focusing on a few vital efforts can lead to significantly greater results than trying to do more."
