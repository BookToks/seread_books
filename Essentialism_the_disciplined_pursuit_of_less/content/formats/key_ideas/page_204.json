  "text": "People who embrace Essentialism deeply gain much more from their efforts than those who only superficially engage with it. The benefits of focusing on what truly matters accumulate over time, making essential choices habitual. As this focus grows, it increasingly overshadows distractions from nonessential pursuits. However, success can create a paradox where new opportunities distract us, leading to a lack of clarity and spreading ourselves too thin.\n\nWhen we commit to Essentialism, each decision to prioritize what is essential reinforces our ability to do so, turning it into a natural part of our lives. Over time, this focus on meaningful pursuits expands, pushing aside the less important. Yet, as we succeed, we may find ourselves faced with numerous new options, which can cloud our judgment and dilute our effectiveness. Instead of making significant strides in our core goals, we risk becoming overwhelmed by lesser tasks and distractions.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Embracing Essentialism leads to greater cumulative benefits and a clearer focus on meaningful accomplishments by eliminating the nonessential."
