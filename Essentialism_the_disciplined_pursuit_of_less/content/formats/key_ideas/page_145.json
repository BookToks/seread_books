  "text": "Doing less can be challenging in both art and life, as it requires that every element has significant value. An editor focuses on making each word count, aiming for clarity and conciseness. This principle of condensing applies to life as well, allowing us to achieve more with fewer resources by prioritizing meaningful activities.\n\nCondensing means eliminating unnecessary elements to enhance clarity and efficiency. In editing, this involves asking whether every word serves a purpose and if ideas can be expressed more succinctly. In life, condensing translates to focusing on impactful activities rather than spreading oneself too thin. For instance, someone might skip lengthy meetings to spend time on more meaningful tasks, effectively turning two hours into ten minutes of essential work. This approach reduces waste and increases the value of our efforts, leading to a more fulfilling and productive life.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Condensing in both editing and life involves eliminating waste to enhance clarity and meaning, allowing for greater contributions with less effort."
