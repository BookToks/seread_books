  "text": "William James emphasized the importance of believing in our own free will. The key skill to develop is the ability to make choices in every aspect of life. Nonessentialists often feel trapped by their circumstances, saying \"I have to,\" which takes away their power to choose. In contrast, essentialists embrace their ability to choose, recognizing that surrendering this power allows others to make decisions for them.\n\nThe journey toward essentialism begins with acknowledging our freedom to choose. When we adopt a mindset of helplessness, we gradually lose control over our lives, becoming influenced by others' decisions or our past actions. This can lead to a cycle where we feel powerless. Essentialists, however, actively celebrate their choices, understanding that relinquishing this power means allowing others to dictate their paths. By choosing to embrace our ability to make decisions, we reclaim our autonomy and direct our lives more purposefully.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The key skill in life is to recognize and exercise the power of choice, as surrendering it leads to helplessness and allows others to dictate our decisions."
