  "text": "Creating space to explore ideas and possibilities is crucial for an Essentialist mindset. This approach encourages flexibility in thinking, allowing individuals to adjust their focus rather than fixate on a single point. A course called “Designing Life, Essentially” exemplifies this by providing students with dedicated time to reflect and prioritize what truly matters in their lives.\n\nThe concept of creating space for exploration emphasizes the importance of stepping back from distractions to engage in deeper thinking. In the course, students are encouraged to disconnect from technology and instead harness their mental energy to identify what is essential versus what is merely good. This practice is not limited to a classroom setting; anyone can cultivate this habit in their daily lives to gain clarity and focus on their true priorities.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Creating space for exploration and focused thinking allows individuals to discern the essential from the non-essential in their lives."
