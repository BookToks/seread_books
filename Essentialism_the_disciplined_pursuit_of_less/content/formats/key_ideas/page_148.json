  "text": "Jin-Yung, an employee at a technology company, learned to set boundaries when she told her manager \"No\" to an additional project while preparing for her wedding. This marked a turning point for her, as she had always said yes to every request, often at the cost of her own well-being. Her decision not only allowed her to focus on her wedding but also encouraged her teammates to assert their own boundaries.\n\nBy saying \"No\" for the first time, Jin-Yung took control of her time and priorities, which had significant implications for her team. This shift in behavior highlighted the importance of setting limits to maintain personal balance. When she declined the extra project, it inspired her colleagues to do the same, demonstrating that collective boundary-setting can lead to shared accountability. This experience taught Jin-Yung that respecting her own needs can foster a healthier work environment for everyone.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Jin-Yung learns the importance of setting boundaries by saying \"No\" to additional work, which leads to unexpected support from her team."
