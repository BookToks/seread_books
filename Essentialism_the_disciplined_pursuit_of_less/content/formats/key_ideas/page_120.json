  "text": "Essential intent goes beyond job roles or mission statements; it serves as a guiding force for one's life purpose. Nelson Mandela exemplified this by using his twenty-seven years in prison to focus on eliminating apartheid, letting go of distractions and resentment. Crafting an essential intent requires courage and discipline to prioritize what truly matters.\n\nCreating a clear essential intent is challenging but vital for meaningful impact. It demands deep reflection to identify which actions will lead to your greatest contributions. This process involves tough decisions and sacrifices, as you must let go of competing priorities that divert your focus. However, when you achieve clarity about your purpose, you empower yourself and your team to work effectively towards excellence. Just as Mandelaâ€™s commitment shaped history, a well-defined intent can guide you to make significant changes in your own life and beyond.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essential intent is a guiding principle that helps individuals focus on their true purpose and eliminate distractions to achieve excellence."
