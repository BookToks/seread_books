  "text": "Alex changes his strategy by placing the slowest boy, Herbie, at the front of the group, allowing everyone to move together. This approach means the whole troop will travel at Herbie's pace, which is slower, but any small improvement in Herbie's speed will benefit the entire group. Alex realizes that this method can also help improve his production plant by identifying the slowest part of the process and focusing on enhancing its efficiency.\n\nBy identifying and addressing the slowest part of a process, you can create a ripple effect that boosts overall performance. Instead of making random improvements that may not yield significant results, it's crucial to pinpoint the main obstacle holding you back. This focused approach helps streamline efforts and reduces unnecessary friction, ultimately leading to more effective execution of essential tasks.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To enhance overall productivity, identify and remove the key obstacle that slows down progress in any system."
