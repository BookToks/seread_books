  "text": "Quick Summary  \nThe text discusses the concept of loss aversion and how people often hold onto their possessions too tightly. This tendency can lead to poor decision-making, as individuals may avoid letting go of items or investments even when it would be more beneficial.\n\nExplanation  \nLoss aversion is a psychological phenomenon where the fear of losing something outweighs the pleasure of gaining something new. Imagine holding onto a broken toy because you once loved it, even though it no longer brings you joy. This attachment can cloud judgment, causing people to stick with unwise choices. For instance, a person might continue investing in a failing project simply because theyâ€™ve already invested time and money into it. Understanding this tendency can help individuals make clearer decisions by recognizing when it's time to let go and pursue better opportunities.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The text references various sources discussing concepts related to decision-making, biases, and the importance of prioritization in life and work."
