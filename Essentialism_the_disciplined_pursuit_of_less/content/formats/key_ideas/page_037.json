  "text": "Many people have followed a path set by someone else without questioning it. This experience is common and highlights how easily we can lose our sense of direction. \n\nWhen we allow others to dictate our choices, we may stray from our own desires and goals. This can lead to feelings of dissatisfaction or confusion about our true purpose. It's essential to recognize this tendency and reclaim our ability to make decisions that align with our own values and aspirations. By doing so, we empower ourselves to pursue a life that truly reflects who we are, rather than merely conforming to someone else's expectations.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Many people unconsciously follow paths set by others instead of making their own choices."
