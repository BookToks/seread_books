  "text": "When executives are asked to define their boundaries, they often struggle to articulate them. It's important to identify dealbreakersâ€”requests or activities that conflict with personal priorities. Noticing feelings of resentment from minor violations can help uncover these boundaries. Additionally, establishing clear social contracts with colleagues can enhance collaboration by outlining priorities and limits, preventing misunderstandings and ensuring that both parties can focus on what truly matters.\n\nIdentifying your dealbreakers is crucial for maintaining focus on your essential goals. Many people find it difficult to express their boundaries, which can lead to others unknowingly crossing them. By reflecting on moments when you feel uncomfortable or burdened by requests, you can pinpoint what is unacceptable to you. Creating social contracts with colleagues fosters a clear understanding of each person's priorities and limits, allowing for a more productive working relationship. This proactive approach helps avoid wasted time and energy on unaligned tasks, enabling both parties to contribute effectively to shared objectives.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Identifying and articulating personal boundaries, or dealbreakers, is essential for maintaining focus on one's priorities and achieving effective collaboration."
