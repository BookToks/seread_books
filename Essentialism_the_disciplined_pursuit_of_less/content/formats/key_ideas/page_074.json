  "text": "Get Out into the Field  \nJane Chen and her classmates worked on a project to create a low-cost baby incubator. They realized that simply reducing the price wouldn't solve the problem, as many babies were born at home without electricity. By visiting Nepal, they understood the real needs and developed a solution that didn't require power, leading to the creation of the \"Embrace Nest.\"\n\nBy stepping into the field, Jane and her team gained crucial insights that transformed their approach to the problem. They discovered that the majority of low-birthweight babies were born in rural areas without access to hospitals or electricity. This understanding shifted their focus from merely creating a cheaper incubator to designing a solution that worked in the specific context of these communities. The \"Embrace Nest\" became a practical and effective tool, using a heated waxlike substance to keep babies warm for hours. This experience highlights the importance of firsthand exploration in problem-solving, ensuring that solutions address the true needs of those affected.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** By immersing themselves in the real-world context of their challenge, Jane Chen and her team were able to identify the true needs and create an effective, electricity-free solution for low-birthweight infants."
