  "text": "In the first pattern, teams become fixated on gaining their manager's approval. When there’s no clear goal, team members create their own competitions, focusing on impressing the manager rather than contributing meaningfully. This behavior is not only unproductive but also harmful. Similarly, in personal lives, lacking a clear purpose leads to distractions, where people prioritize superficial achievements over what truly matters, like relationships and well-being.\n\nWithout a clear direction, teams often chase after the manager's attention instead of focusing on their contributions. This results in team members competing against each other, trying to appear more important or aligned with the manager’s views. Such actions detract from the team's overall effectiveness. In our personal lives, when we lack clarity about our goals and values, we can easily get sidetracked by superficial comparisons, leading us to overlook essential activities that enrich our lives, such as spending time with loved ones or caring for our health.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** When teams lack a clear purpose, they engage in counterproductive activities focused on gaining favor rather than making meaningful contributions."
