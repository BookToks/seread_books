  "text": "The concept of \"decision fatigue\" highlights how an overwhelming number of choices can lead to poorer decision-making. Additionally, the rise of social pressure, fueled by technology, has intensified the influence of others on our decisions. The belief that we can do everything and have it all is pervasive, but it's increasingly harmful as expectations and choices multiply, leading to stress and confusion about priorities.\n\nThe idea of decision fatigue suggests that when faced with too many options, our ability to make good choices declines. This is compounded by social pressure, as technology allows more people to express their opinions on what we should prioritize. The myth that we can achieve everything is deeply ingrained in society, yet it creates unrealistic expectations. Many feel the need to juggle numerous responsibilities, resulting in stress and a chaotic life. Historically, the term \"priority\" meant one primary focus, but its pluralization has led to the misconception that we can have multiple top priorities, which is fundamentally contradictory.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The overwhelming number of choices and social pressures today lead to decision fatigue and the false belief that we can have and do it all."
