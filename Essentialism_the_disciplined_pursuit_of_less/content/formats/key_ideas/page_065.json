  "text": "Frustration can arise when we feel our schedules control us instead of the other way around. However, creating space to think allows leaders to focus on essential questions about their company's future and recharge emotionally. This practice is integral to a broader philosophy that emphasizes the importance of disciplined decision-making over the undisciplined pursuit of more.\n\nBy intentionally setting aside time to reflect, leaders can address critical issues such as long-term company vision, product improvement, and competitive strategy. This space not only fosters creativity and problem-solving but also helps leaders transition between different roles, such as from problem-solver to coach. For some, like Jeff, this approach goes beyond mere practice; it embodies a philosophy that recognizes the negative consequences of trying to do too much at once. Embracing this mindset can lead to more effective leadership and a healthier work environment.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Creating space for reflection and strategic thinking is essential for effective leadership and personal well-being."
