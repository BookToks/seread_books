  "text": "Starting early and investing minimal effort can significantly ease the stress of meeting deadlines. By dedicating just a few minutes to prepare in advance, you can avoid last-minute panic. Simple actions, like jotting down ideas or setting objectives, can lay the groundwork for success without requiring a large time commitment.\n\nWhen tackling important goals, there are two approaches: starting early with small steps or waiting until the last minute to do everything at once. Investing even a brief amount of time ahead of a deadline can prevent frantic scrambling later. For instance, beginning to outline a presentation now, even for just a few minutes, can make a huge difference. Similarly, taking a moment to note objectives before a meeting can streamline preparation. These small, early efforts can lead to more organized and less stressful outcomes, much like watching a progress chart rise can motivate and encourage continued effort.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Starting early with minimal preparation can significantly reduce stress and enhance productivity."
