  "text": "To maintain a clutter-free closet, an Essentialist takes a systematic approach. First, they evaluate items by asking if they truly love and frequently wear them. Next, they confront the challenge of letting go of items, using a question about their potential purchase value to overcome attachment. Finally, they establish a routine for organizing, ensuring that their space remains tidy and focused on what truly matters.\n\nAn Essentialist's method for managing their closet can be applied to life in general. By critically assessing what we own or do, we can identify what truly contributes to our goals. The process involves asking tough questions to determine value, and then actively removing non-essential items or tasks. This not only clears physical space but also mental clutter, allowing us to focus on what enhances our lives. Regularly maintaining this system is key to ensuring ongoing clarity and purpose.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** An Essentialist approach involves exploring, evaluating, eliminating, and executing to focus on activities that contribute the most to one's goals."
