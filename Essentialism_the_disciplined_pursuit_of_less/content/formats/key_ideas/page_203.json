  "text": "Artists contribute significantly in various ways, but they all share a common trait: they fully embrace the concept of \"less but better.\" This mindset is not just an occasional practice; it can be a way of life. Regardless of our profession, we all have the opportunity to adopt this Essentialist approach. \n\nTo truly embody Essentialism, one must move beyond merely applying its principles from time to time. It’s about recognizing the distinction between being a Nonessentialist who occasionally practices Essentialist habits and being an Essentialist who consistently prioritizes what truly matters. The key question is identifying which mindset—Essentialist or Nonessentialist—dominates your core values. By doing so, you can shift towards a more intentional and focused way of living.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To truly embrace Essentialism, one must choose to become an Essentialist at their core rather than merely practicing it occasionally."
