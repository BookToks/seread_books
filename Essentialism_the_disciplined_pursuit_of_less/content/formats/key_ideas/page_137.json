  "text": "Admitting when we’ve made a mistake is crucial for moving forward. Denial keeps us stuck in unproductive patterns, while acknowledging our errors allows us to learn and grow. Similarly, trying to force situations that aren’t working can lead to wasted time and energy. Seeking an unbiased perspective can help us recognize when it’s time to let go of something that isn’t a good fit.\n\nTo progress in life, we must be willing to recognize our missteps. Just like a friend who refuses to ask for directions, clinging to mistakes can lead to aimless wandering. Accepting failure is not a sign of weakness; it shows growth. Additionally, when we push to make something work that clearly isn’t right, we waste valuable resources. By consulting someone who isn’t emotionally tied to the situation, we can gain clarity and the courage to move on from what doesn’t serve us.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Admitting failure allows us to move forward and avoid wasting time on mismatched commitments."
