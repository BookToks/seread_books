  "text": "For a long time, we have focused too much on the choices available to us and not enough on our own power to make decisions. This distinction is significant because while options can be removed, our fundamental ability to choose remains intact. Ultimately, this ability cannot be lost or surrendered; it can only be overlooked or forgotten.\n\nRecognizing our inherent power to choose is crucial. While we often feel constrained by external options, the reality is that our ability to make decisions is always within us. Just like a muscle that can weaken from disuse, our capacity for choice can diminish if we neglect it. By acknowledging that we have the freedom to choose our actions, we empower ourselves to take control of our lives, regardless of the circumstances we face. Understanding this can lead to greater confidence and clarity in our decision-making.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** We often overlook our inherent ability to choose, focusing instead on external options that can be taken away."
