  "text": "experienced how projects and commitments often take longer than expected, filling the time we allocate for them. This is common in meetings and presentations, where speakers try to fit too much content into limited time. A facilitator once created a workshop that allowed ample time for questions, which proved beneficial when discussions naturally extended. Similarly, a mother learned to pack for vacations well in advance, allowing for a smoother, stress-free departure. This approach contrasts with the typical mindset of assuming everything will go perfectly, which often leads to last-minute chaos and rushed outcomes.\n\nMany people underestimate the time needed for tasks, leading to stress and rushed work. In presentations, for example, speakers often try to cram too much information into a short period, resulting in missed opportunities for meaningful engagement. A facilitator who allowed extra time for questions showed how beneficial it can be to plan for the unexpected. Similarly, a mother discovered that packing early for a trip made for a more enjoyable journey. By preparing for potential delays, both learned the value of building in extra time, leading to smoother experiences and better outcomes.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Projects and commitments often expand to fill the time allotted, leading to rushed outcomes unless a buffer is built in."
