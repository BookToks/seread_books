  "text": "Avoiding commitment traps involves recognizing the endowment effect, which is our tendency to overvalue what we own. This can lead us to hold onto things or commitments that no longer serve us. For example, we may cling to projects at work or volunteer roles simply because we initiated them, even if they are not beneficial anymore.\n\nTo better understand this, consider how ownership influences our perception. We often assign greater value to items we possess, like a mug we received for free, compared to what we would pay for it if we didn't own it. This bias extends beyond physical objects to commitments and activities. A project or task we lead may feel more vital than it truly is, making it tough to let go. Recognizing this pattern can help us make clearer, more objective decisions about what to keep in our lives.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The endowment effect leads us to overvalue what we own, making it difficult to let go of nonessential commitments and possessions."
