  "text": "The 90 Percent Rule suggests that when making decisions, we should only consider options that score 90 percent or higher based on our criteria. If an option falls below this threshold, we should reject it outright. This method helps us avoid indecision and unnecessary commitments, allowing us to focus on better opportunities.\n\nBy applying the 90 Percent Rule, we streamline our decision-making process. When faced with choices, we assign a score to each based on the most important criterion. If an option scores less than 90, it becomes a no-go, freeing us from the burden of second-guessing ourselves. This approach also highlights the importance of trade-offs; sometimes, we must let go of good options to make room for better ones. Ultimately, it encourages us to take control of our choices, ensuring we pursue only those that truly align with our goals.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The 90 Percent Rule encourages making decisions by rejecting any option that scores below 90 percent, promoting a disciplined approach to selecting only the best choices in life."
