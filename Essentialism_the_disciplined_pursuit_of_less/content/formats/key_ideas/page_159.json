  "text": "Creating buffers in our lives and work helps us manage the unexpected. We often face uncertainties, like traffic or last-minute changes at work. By preparing ahead and allowing extra time or space, we can reduce stress and avoid last-minute chaos.\n\nBuffers act as protective measures, giving us room to respond to surprises without panicking. For instance, when driving, keeping a safe distance from the car ahead allows us to react to sudden stops or changes. In the same way, incorporating buffers in our schedules or projects helps us stay on track despite unforeseen challenges. If we neglect these buffers, we may find ourselves scrambling to meet deadlines or deal with crises, leading to unnecessary stress. Thus, maintaining these buffers is crucial for smooth and effective execution of our essential tasks.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Creating buffers in our lives helps us manage the unexpected and reduces friction in executing essential tasks."
