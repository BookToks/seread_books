  "text": "Setting boundaries is essential to prevent others from taking advantage of your time and energy. Just like a fence protects your yard, clear boundaries help you maintain control over your own life. Without them, you risk being overwhelmed by others' demands, limiting your own freedom and choices.\n\nBoundaries act as protective barriers, allowing you to focus on what truly matters to you. When you establish clear limits, you empower yourself to choose how to spend your time and energy. This is similar to how a fence around a playground allows children to explore freely within a safe space. Without boundaries, you may find yourself constrained by others' expectations, but with them, you can enjoy greater freedom and a wider range of options in your life.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Setting clear boundaries allows individuals to protect their time and energy, leading to greater freedom and productivity."
