This allowed them to concentrate on the most valuable work that set them apart in the market. Additionally, it empowered employees to choose projects where they could contribute the most, giving them a voice in decision-making that they previously lacked.\n\nBy defining selective and explicit criteria, teams can systematically identify what truly matters and discard the non-essential tasks. This approach not only streamlines efforts but also encourages team members to engage actively in discussions about priorities. For instance, one junior employee felt empowered to question a senior executive about whether a project aligned with their established criteria. This shift fosters a culture where everyone can contribute to decision-making, ensuring that the focus remains on high-impact work.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Identifying selective and explicit criteria enables individuals and teams to focus on essential work while empowering them to contribute meaningfully."
