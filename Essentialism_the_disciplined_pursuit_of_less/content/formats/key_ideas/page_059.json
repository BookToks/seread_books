Once a month, he gathers all employees for a day without phones or emails, allowing them to think and converse freely. This break helps them focus on what truly matters, fostering innovation and clarity. O’Brien believes that if employees are too busy to attend this meeting, it signals inefficiencies or the need for more staff.\n\nO’Brien’s approach emphasizes the importance of taking a step back from daily demands to gain perspective. By creating a space for uninterrupted thought, employees can better identify what is essential in their work. This practice not only boosts creativity but also serves as a diagnostic tool for the company’s workload. If employees find themselves overwhelmed and unable to participate, it indicates a need to reassess priorities and resources. In a world where busyness often overshadows productivity, such moments of solitude are crucial for meaningful progress.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Frank O’Brien's practice of designating a day for employees to think and talk without distractions highlights the necessity of solitude to identify what is truly essential in a fast-paced work environment."
