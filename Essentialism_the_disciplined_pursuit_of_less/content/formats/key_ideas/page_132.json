  "text": "Half of life's problems stem from agreeing too quickly and not declining soon enough. The Concorde jet was an impressive engineering feat, allowing rapid transatlantic flights, but it ultimately lost money for decades. Despite knowing it was unlikely to become profitable, the British and French governments kept investing due to a psychological tendency known as \"sunk-cost bias.\"\n\nSunk-cost bias occurs when people continue to pour resources into a project or decision because they have already invested so much, even when it's clear that the outcome will be negative. In the case of the Concorde, officials were aware that the financial returns were unlikely to justify the ongoing expenses. However, their commitment to the project made it difficult to back out, leading them to throw good money after bad. This illustrates how our emotions can cloud judgment, making it hard to let go of failing endeavors.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The Concorde jet exemplifies how sunk-cost bias can lead to continued investment in a failing project despite clear evidence of its financial impracticality."
