  "text": "To evaluate opportunities effectively, first identify the specific opportunity being presented. Next, create a list of three minimum criteria that the opportunity must meet to be considered. Lastly, outline three ideal or extreme criteria that would elevate the opportunity to a higher standard. If the opportunity fails to meet any of the minimum criteria, it should be rejected outright. Additionally, if it does not satisfy at least two of the extreme criteria, it should also be declined.\n\nEvaluating opportunities requires a structured approach. Start by clarifying what is being offered, which helps focus your decision-making. Then, establish a set of minimum criteria—these are the basic requirements that any opportunity must fulfill for you to consider it. Following that, define your ideal criteria, which represent your highest standards. This two-tiered system allows you to make informed choices. If an opportunity doesn’t meet the minimum criteria, it’s a definite no. Even if it passes the minimum, failing to meet two of the extreme criteria suggests it may not be worth pursuing.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To effectively evaluate opportunities, establish minimum and extreme criteria that must be met for consideration."
