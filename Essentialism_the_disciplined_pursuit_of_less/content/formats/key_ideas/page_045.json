  "text": "Some people think the connection between effort and results isn't straightforward. According to the power law theory, certain efforts yield much greater results than others. For instance, top software developers can be up to 10,000 times more productive than average ones. This highlights that while many tasks may seem valuable, only a few truly stand out as exceptionally important.\n\nThe idea presented here is that not all efforts are equal; some can lead to vastly superior outcomes. This is illustrated by the concept of the power law, which suggests that a small number of actions can produce significant results compared to the majority of tasks that yield little. Essentially, in our busy lives, we often focus on many tasks that arenâ€™t truly meaningful. Recognizing the few high-impact efforts can help us prioritize better and achieve more with less effort.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Certain efforts yield exponentially better results than others, highlighting the importance of focusing on what is truly valuable."
