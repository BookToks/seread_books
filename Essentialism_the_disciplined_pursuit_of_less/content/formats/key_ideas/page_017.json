  "text": "Many successful companies have experienced significant failures due to their relentless pursuit of growth and expansion. Jim Collins, in his book \"How the Mighty Fall,\" highlights that this lack of discipline often leads to their downfall. This issue is not just limited to organizations; individuals in these companies can also suffer from the consequences of chasing too many goals without focus.\n\nThe idea of the \"undisciplined pursuit of more\" refers to the tendency to take on too much, whether in business or personal life. Companies that once thrived can lose their way by trying to do everything at once, leading to confusion and inefficiency. Similarly, employees may find themselves overwhelmed by numerous demands, preventing them from excelling in any one area. This concept emphasizes the importance of focus and discipline, suggesting that success comes from prioritizing what truly matters rather than spreading oneself too thin.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The undisciplined pursuit of more leads to failure for both companies and individuals."
