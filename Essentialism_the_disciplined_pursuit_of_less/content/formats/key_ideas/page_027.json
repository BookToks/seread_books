  "text": "By using stricter criteria, we can better utilize our brain's ability to search for opportunities. Instead of looking for many good options, we should focus on what truly inspires us, where our talents lie, and what significant needs exist in the world. This targeted approach helps us identify our most meaningful contributions rather than just any good idea. Essentialists prioritize exploration, but it serves the purpose of distinguishing the most important choices from the less significant ones.\n\nEssentialists enhance their decision-making by refining their search for opportunities. Rather than settling for a broad range of options, they focus on what genuinely inspires them, aligns with their skills, and addresses real-world needs.

Their exploration involves deep thinking and discussion, but it’s not just for the sake of it; it’s about finding the most impactful paths to pursue, ensuring their efforts lead to meaningful contributions.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** By applying tougher criteria and asking specific questions, we can focus on identifying our highest level of contribution rather than being overwhelmed by numerous good opportunities."
