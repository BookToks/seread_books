  "text": "Many people experience learned helplessness, which can happen when they feel powerless to change their situation. This can lead to two main responses: some may stop trying altogether, while others may become overly active, taking on too many tasks because they believe they have no choice. Recognizing our ability to choose is crucial, as it empowers us to make decisions rather than feeling forced into actions.\n\nUnderstanding our capacity for choice is essential for personal growth. When we feel helpless, like a child struggling with math, we might give up or overcompensate by trying to do everything at once. This behavior often masks a lack of true choice. Everyday pressures, like marketing tactics or social obligations, can make it hard to recognize that we have options. Embracing our ability to choose is a fundamental aspect of becoming an Essentialist, allowing us to reclaim our power and make intentional decisions.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Humans can learn helplessness when they believe their efforts do not matter, leading to a loss of the ability to choose."
