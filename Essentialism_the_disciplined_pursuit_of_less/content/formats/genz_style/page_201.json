  "text": "When Gandhi passed, people said he was the voice of humanity. He turned humility and simple truths into something more powerful than entire empires. 🌍 Einstein chimed in too, saying future generations would hardly believe someone like him ever existed.\n\nNo doubt, Gandhi lived a life that truly mattered. \n\nBut here’s the thing: we don’t need to be Gandhi to learn from him. We can all clear out the clutter in our lives and embrace the Essentialist mindset—each in our own way, at our own pace, and on our own terms. We can live simply but also contribute a lot and find real meaning in our lives. ✨\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** We can all embrace the way of the Essentialist by purging nonessential elements from our lives to live with simplicity, high contribution, and meaning."
