  "text": "### CUTTING OUT THE TRIVIAL MANY\n\nA lot of us say yes to stuff because we want to please others and make an impact. But here’s the kicker: saying no might actually let us make our biggest contributions. Peter Drucker nailed it when he said, “People are effective because they say ‘no,’ because they say, ‘this isn’t for me.’” \n\nSaying no often means disappointing someone. It can feel tough, especially when there’s social pressure. Doing this well takes guts and kindness. So, cutting out the nonessentials isn’t just about mental strength; it’s also about having the emotional discipline to resist that pressure.\n\nLet’s face it: we can’t do everything. The real question isn’t how we can do it all; it’s who gets to decide what we do and don’t do. If we give up our right to choose, someone else will decide for us. We can either make intentional choices about what to skip or let ourselves get pulled into things we don’t really want to do. \n\nThis section will give you a way to cut out the nonessentials, freeing up time to focus on what really matters. Only then can we create a system that makes execution feel effortless. 🚀\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Eliminating nonessentials requires the courage to say no, allowing us to focus on what truly matters and make our highest contributions."
