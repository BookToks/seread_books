  "text": "**Shattering the Sleep Stigma**\n\nSo, if “protecting the asset” (your brain) is crucial, why do we ditch sleep so easily? For overachievers, it might be because they believe the myth that less sleep equals more success. But research shows that getting good sleep actually boosts our productivity, not the other way around.\n\nIn K. Anders Ericsson’s famous study on violinists (you know, the “10,000-Hour Rule” popularized by Malcolm Gladwell), he found that the best violinists practiced more than just the good ones. This backs up the Essentialist idea that mastery comes from focused effort. The cool part? It means anyone can achieve excellence, not just the naturally talented. \n\nBut here’s the catch: this can lead to the dangerous mindset of “I have to do it all,” which justifies working longer hours with less return. \n\nNow, let’s look at another finding from the same study: the second biggest factor separating the best violinists from the good ones was actually sleep. The top violinists averaged 8.6 hours of sleep every night—about an hour more than the average American. Plus, they took about 2.8 hours of naps during the day—two hours more than most people. The study concluded that sleep helped these top performers recharge so they could practice with better focus. So yes, they practiced more, but they also got way more out of that practice because they were well-rested.\n\nIn a Harvard Business Review article called “Sleep Deficit: The Performance Killer,” Charles A. Czeisler, a sleep medicine expert at Harvard, explained how lack of sleep wrecks high performance. He compared sleep deprivation to being drunk, saying that pulling an all-nighter (going 24 hours without sleep) or getting just four or five hours of sleep for a week can impair you as much as a blood alcohol level of 0.1%.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The belief that sacrificing sleep leads to greater achievement is challenged by research showing that adequate sleep enhances productivity and performance."
