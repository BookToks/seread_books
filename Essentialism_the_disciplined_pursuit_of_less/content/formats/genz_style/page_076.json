  "text": "**Clarify the Question**\n\nEver notice how politicians can dodge questions like pros? We all feel the urge to avoid tough questions sometimes. It's way easier to give a vague answer than to dig up the facts for a solid response. But dodging just leads to more confusion and misinformation. The key to breaking that cycle? Clarifying the question.\n\nTake Elay Cohen, a senior VP at Salesforce. He was in a crowded hotel room with five others, gearing up for a business simulation. They had to tackle a series of hypothetical management questions. But instead of diving in, Elay's team got stuck. Every answer sparked more opinions, turning a simple task into a messy debate. \n\nI was there to coach them and after fifteen minutes of chaos, I had to step in. ‚ÄúWhat question are you trying to answer?‚Äù I asked. Silence. No one knew. Then someone veered off topic again.\n\nI asked again. And again. Finally, they paused and really thought about their goals and the decisions they needed to make. They stopped the side chatter, sifted through the random ideas, and found the common themes. That‚Äôs when they shifted from being stuck to gaining momentum. They created a game plan, made decisions, and assigned tasks. In the end, Elay's team crushed it! üèÜ\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Clarifying the question is essential to avoid vagueness and misinformation, enabling teams to focus on their goals and make informed decisions."
