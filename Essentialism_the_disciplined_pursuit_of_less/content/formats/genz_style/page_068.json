  "text": "CHAPTER 6  \nLOOK  \nSee What Really Matters  \n\nWHERE IS THE KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE LOST IN INFORMATION?  \n—T. S. Eliot  \n\nNora Ephron is famous for movies like *Silkwood*, *Sleepless in Seattle*, and *When Harry Met Sally*—all Oscar nominees. Her success as a writer and screenwriter comes from her knack for capturing the heart of a story. This skill started back in her high school days when she took a Journalism 101 class taught by Charlie O. Simms at Beverly Hills High School. \n\nOn the first day, Simms kicked things off by explaining the concept of a “lead.” This is the part of a story that tells you the why, what, when, and who. It’s the core info you need. Then he gave the class their first task: write a lead for a story. \n\nHe laid out the facts: “Kenneth L. Peters, the principal of Beverly Hills High School, announced today that the entire high school faculty will travel to Sacramento next Thursday for a colloquium in new teaching methods. Among the speakers will be anthropologist Margaret Mead, college president Dr. Robert Maynard Hutchins, and California governor Edmund ‘Pat’ Brown.” \n\nThe students typed away on their manual typewriters, trying to keep up. They submitted their quickly written leads, each aiming to summarize the who, what, where, and why as clearly as possible.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Nora Ephron's success as a writer stems from her ability to distill the essence of a story, a skill she learned in high school journalism."
