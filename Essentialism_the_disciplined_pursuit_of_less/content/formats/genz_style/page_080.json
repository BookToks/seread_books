  "text": "A Mind Invited to Play\n\nPlay is super important in our lives. Studies on animals show that play is vital for developing key skills and might even help a species survive. Bob Fagan, who has studied grizzly bears for 15 years, found that bears who play the most tend to live longer. He explained, “In a world full of challenges and uncertainty, play helps these bears adapt.”\n\nJaak Panksepp reached a similar conclusion in his book, Affective Neuroscience. He noted that during play, animals act in flexible and creative ways. \n\nHumans, according to Stuart Brown, are the biggest players of all. We’re made to play and grow through it. When we engage in play, we express our true selves. It’s no surprise that our best memories often come from moments of play. 🎉\n\nPlay expands our minds, letting us explore new ideas and view old ones differently. It makes us curious, open to new experiences, and more engaged. Play is essential for living like an Essentialist because it fuels exploration in three key ways.\n\nFirst, play broadens our options. It helps us see possibilities we might miss and connect ideas we wouldn’t normally link. It opens our minds and challenges old beliefs, making us more open to new ideas. It allows us to let our thoughts flow and create new stories. As Einstein said, “The gift of fantasy has meant more to me than my talent for absorbing positive knowledge.” ✨\n\nSecond, play fights stress, which is crucial since stress not only kills productivity but can also shut down our thinking.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Play is essential for cognitive development and exploration, enhancing creativity and reducing stress."
