  "text": "In your daily life, you need to spot the “slowest hiker.” 🥾 \n\nA Nonessentialist reacts to everything. They’re always putting out fires instead of planning ahead. This leads to quick fixes—like sticking a finger in a leaking dam and praying it doesn’t burst. They think if they’re good with a hammer, everything’s a nail. So they just keep pushing harder, which creates more friction and frustration. Sometimes, pushing too hard just makes people push back harder. \n\nEssentialists don’t settle for Band-Aid fixes. They don’t just focus on the obvious problems. Instead, they dig deeper and find what’s really slowing them down. They ask, “What’s blocking my path to what really matters?” While the Nonessentialist is busy piling on quick fixes, the Essentialist invests in removing obstacles once and for all. This isn’t just about solving problems; it’s about cutting down your effort to get better results. \n\n| Nonessentialist                   | Essentialist                     |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Piles on quick-fix solutions       | Removes obstacles to progress    |\n| Does more                          | Brings forth more                |\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialists focus on removing obstacles to progress rather than applying quick-fix solutions, leading to greater results with less effort."
