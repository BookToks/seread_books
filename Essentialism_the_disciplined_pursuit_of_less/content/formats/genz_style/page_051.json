  "text": "They lost hundreds of millions because of delayed flights. According to Porter, “late flights and cancellations generated a thousand complaints a day.” The CEO ended up getting fired. The takeaway? Ignoring trade-offs is a bad move for any organization. And guess what? It’s a bad move for individuals too. \n\nEver hang out with someone who always tries to squeeze in one more thing? They know they have ten minutes to get to a meeting that takes ten minutes to walk to, yet they still stop to answer a couple of emails first. Or they agree to finish a report by Friday, even though they have another huge deadline that same day. Maybe they promise to swing by their cousin’s birthday party on Saturday, even though they have tickets to a show that starts at the exact same time. Their logic? “I can do both.” The problem? That logic is totally flawed. \n\nInevitably, they’re late to the meeting, miss one or both deadlines (or do a half-hearted job on both), and either don’t make it to their cousin’s party or miss the show. The truth is, saying yes to one opportunity means saying no to several others. \n\nTrade-offs are real, both in our personal and professional lives. Until we accept this, we risk becoming like Continental Airlines—stuck in a “straddled strategy” that forces us to make sacrifices we might not have chosen otherwise. \n\nIn an insightful op-ed for the New York Times, Erin Callan, the former CFO of Lehman Brothers, shared her experience with trade-offs. She said, “I didn’t start out with the goal of devoting all of myself to my job. It crept in over time.” Each year, small changes became the new normal. First, she spent half an hour on Sunday organizing her email and calendar to make Monday easier. Then, she was working a few hours on Sunday, then all day. Her boundaries faded until work was all that was left. \n\nHer story shows a crucial truth: we can either make tough choices for ourselves or let others—like colleagues, bosses, or customers—make them for us. In my experience, senior executives are often the worst at accepting the reality of trade-offs.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Ignoring the reality of trade-offs leads to poor outcomes in both personal and professional contexts."
