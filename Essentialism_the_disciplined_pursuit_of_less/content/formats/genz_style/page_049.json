  "text": "**CHAPTER 4: TRADE-OFF**\n\n**Which Problem Do I Want?**\n\nStrategy is all about making choices and trade-offs. Itâ€™s about intentionally choosing to stand out. \n\nImagine you could go back to 1972 and invest a dollar in every company in the S&P 500. Which one would give you the biggest return by 2002? GE? IBM? Intel? According to Money magazine and Ned Davis Research, itâ€™s none of those. The real winner is Southwest Airlines. Crazy, right? The airline biz usually struggles with profits. But Southwest, led by Herb Kelleher, has crushed it year after year. His Essentialist mindset is key to this success.\n\nI once saw Herb speak about his business strategy. It was insightful, but what really caught my attention was how deliberate he was about the trade-offs at Southwest. Instead of trying to fly everywhere, they focused on point-to-point flights. They skipped the pricey meals to keep costs low. Instead of pre-assigning seats, they let passengers pick their own as they boarded. And forget fancy first-class service; they only offered coach.\n\nThese trade-offs werenâ€™t random; they were strategic choices to keep costs down. Sure, he risked losing customers who wanted more options, but it paid off big time. ðŸŒŸ\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Herb Kelleher's Essentialist approach at Southwest Airlines involved deliberate trade-offs to maintain low costs and achieve consistent financial success."
