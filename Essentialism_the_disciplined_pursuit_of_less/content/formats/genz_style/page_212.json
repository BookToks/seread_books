  "text": "### APPENDIX  \n### Leadership Essentials  \n\nNever doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; it’s the only thing that ever has. —Margaret Mead  \n\nLinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner believes in doing “fewer things better” as the key to strong leadership. When he took over LinkedIn, he could have followed the usual Silicon Valley playbook and chased every opportunity. Instead, he turned down some really good chances to focus on the best ones. He uses the acronym FCS (which stands for FOCUS) to share his approach with his team. It means:  \n- Fewer things done better  \n- Communicating the right info to the right people at the right time  \n- Speed and quality in decision-making  \n\nThis is what it means to lead with essentialism.  \n\n### ESSENTIALIST TEAMS  \n\nThinking and acting with essentialism is just as important in leading teams and companies as it is in our personal lives. I first realized many of these ideas while working with executive teams.  \n\nI gathered insights from over five hundred people about their experiences on more than one thousand teams. I asked them to share what it was like to be part of a unified team, the role their manager played, and what the outcomes were. Then, I had them compare this with their experiences on disunified teams, including how their manager influenced things and how it affected the results.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Leadership effectiveness is enhanced by focusing on fewer priorities to achieve better outcomes."
