  "text": "Give yourself permission to skip the polish in your first draft. By tackling the biggest hurdle first, you make everything else easier. \n\nThe “slowest hiker” might not just be you—it could be someone else. Think about a boss who won’t approve your project, the finance team delaying the budget, or a client dragging their feet on a signature. \n\nTo ease the friction with these people, try the “catch more flies with honey” method. Instead of sending a demanding email, go talk to them. Ask, “What’s holding you back from getting this done, and how can I help?” Instead of being a bother, show genuine support. You’ll get a much better response than just firing off another email. \n\nWhen my kids were really young and I was in grad school, my wife felt overwhelmed with the daily demands of parenting. I was reading about the Theory of Constraints, which got me thinking. We figured out that the main thing keeping her from being fully involved with our kids was a lack of time to plan and prepare. With three little ones, uninterrupted time was a rare luxury. \n\nSo, we worked to fix that. I cut back on extracurriculars to be home in the evenings, and we found someone to watch the kids for a few hours during the week. This let us be more engaged and present when we were with them. We ended up doing less overall, but it was way better quality time. \n\nRemoving obstacles doesn’t have to be a huge struggle. You can start small. It’s like pushing a boulder at the top of a hill. Just a little shove can get it rolling, and then the momentum takes care of the rest. 💪\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Identifying and removing obstacles can significantly enhance productivity and engagement in both personal and professional contexts."
