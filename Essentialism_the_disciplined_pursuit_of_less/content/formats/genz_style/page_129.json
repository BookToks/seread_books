This is the most socially acceptable way to say no. It doesn’t mean they don’t want to reply; they just can’t right now. So, why save this for vacations only? When I was writing this book, I set up an email bounceback that said…\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialists regularly incorporate a variety of graceful responses into their \"no\" repertoire to effectively decline requests."
