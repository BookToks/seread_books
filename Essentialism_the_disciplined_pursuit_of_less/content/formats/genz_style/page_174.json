  "text": "Clapham’s method showed how powerful celebrating progress can be. Take this story: a cop stopped a teen who saved a girl from getting hit by a car. He gave the kid a Positive Ticket and said, “You did a great thing today. You can make a difference.” The teen went home and put that ticket on his wall. Weeks later, his foster mom asked if he was going to cash it in. To her surprise, he said no. An adult had told him he could be someone special, and that felt way more valuable than free pizza or bowling. 🍕🎳\n\nNow, imagine if that kind of positive feedback happened 40,000 times a year for ten years. You can see how it made a difference. Each time a young person was recognized for doing something good, they got more motivated to keep it up. Eventually, doing good just felt natural and easy.\n\nWhen we want to create big change, we often think we need to start with something huge. Like the executive who made a big deal about building an elaborate dollhouse for his daughters but then ditched the project because it felt too overwhelming. It’s tempting to think that to do something big, we have to start big. But look at all those hyped-up initiatives in organizations that never really went anywhere—just like that dollhouse.\n\nResearch shows that the best motivator for people is progress. Why? Because even a small win builds momentum and boosts our belief in future success. In a famous 1968 Harvard Business Review article, Frederick Herzberg found that the two main motivators for people are achievement and being recognized for it.\n\nMore recently, Teresa Amabile and Steven Kramer collected diary entries from tons of people over thousands of workdays. They discovered that “everyday progress—even a small win” can totally change how people feel and perform. They said, “Of all the things that can boost emotions, motivation, and perceptions during a workday, the single most important is making progress in meaningful work.” 🌟\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Celebrating small achievements fosters motivation and encourages continued positive behavior."
