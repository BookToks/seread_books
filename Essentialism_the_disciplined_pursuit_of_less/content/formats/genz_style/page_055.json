  "text": "Thinks, “I can do both.”  \nAsks, “How can I do it all?”  \nAsks, “What trade-off am I willing to make?”  \nAsks, “What can I really go big on?”  \n\nIn a piece called “Laugh, Kookaburra” from The New Yorker, David Sedaris shares a funny story about his time exploring the Australian bush. While hiking, his friend and guide shares a lesson from a management class: “Picture a four-burner stove,” she says. “One burner is for family, one for friends, one for health, and the last one for work. To be successful, you have to turn off one burner. To be really successful, you need to turn off two.” \n\nOf course, she’s joking. I’m not saying that being an Essentialist means choosing between family, health, and work. What I’m saying is that when you have to choose between family and other priorities like friends, health, or work, you need to ask yourself, “Which problem do I want to tackle?” \n\nTrade-offs aren’t something to ignore or complain about. They’re opportunities to embrace and make thoughtfully and strategically.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Trade-offs should be embraced and made deliberately to achieve desired outcomes."
