  "text": "Here’s how to decide if an opportunity is worth your time:\n\nFirst, figure out what opportunity you’re being offered. \n\nSecond, jot down three “minimum criteria” that this option must meet to be considered. \n\nThird, list three “extreme criteria” that would make this option a must-have. \n\nIf it doesn’t meet your minimum criteria, then it’s a no-brainer: say no. But if it fails to meet two of your three extreme criteria, that’s another no. \n\nKeep it simple:  \n- **What opportunity is being offered to you?**  \n- **What are your minimum criteria for this option?**  \n- **What are your ideal criteria for approval?**\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To effectively evaluate opportunities, establish minimum and extreme criteria that must be met for consideration."
