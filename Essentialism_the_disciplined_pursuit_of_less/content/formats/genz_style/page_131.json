  "text": "Our help is super valuable, but often when people ask for it, they don’t care who gives it—just that they get it. \n\nKay Krill, the CEO of Ann, Inc. (yep, that’s Ann Taylor and LOFT), used to struggle with saying no to social invites. She’d end up at networking events she didn’t want to attend and regretted going to office parties as soon as she arrived.\n\nThen one day, a mentor told her to ditch the people and things that didn’t matter. This advice changed everything. Now, she can choose what to engage with. After some practice, turning down invites became a breeze. Kay says, “I say no very easily because I know what’s important to me. I just wish I’d learned how to do that earlier in life.”\n\nSaying no is a leadership skill, not just a side gig. We all start off not knowing how to do it. At first, we’re total beginners. Then we pick up some basic techniques, make mistakes, learn from them, and get better. Eventually, we build a whole toolkit for handling requests with style. \n\nTom Friel, the former CEO of Heidrick & Struggles, once told me, “We need to learn the slow ‘yes’ and the quick ‘no.’”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Learning to say no effectively allows individuals to focus their energy on what truly matters to them."
