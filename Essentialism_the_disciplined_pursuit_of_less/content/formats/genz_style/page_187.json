  "text": "To change your routine, you don’t need to overhaul your behavior. You just need to identify the cue that triggers your nonessential habits and link it to something essential instead. For example, if passing the bakery makes you want to grab a doughnut, use that same cue to remind yourself to pick up a salad from the deli across the street. Or if your alarm makes you want to check emails, let it remind you to get up and read instead. At first, it might be tough to resist the bakery or the email temptation, but each time you choose the salad or reading, you strengthen the connection in your brain. Soon, the new routine will become automatic. \n\n**CREATE NEW TRIGGERS**  \nYou’re not stuck with your current cues; you can create new ones to kickstart essential habits. I used this method to build my daily journaling routine, and it worked wonders. I used to write in my journal only occasionally. I’d put it off all day, then tell myself, “I’ll do it in the morning.” But morning would come, and I’d skip it, leaving me with two days’ worth to write at night. Total overwhelm!  \n\nThen I heard about someone who wrote a few lines at the same time each day. It sounded doable, but I knew I needed a cue to remind me. So, I started keeping my journal in my bag next to my phone. Now, when I pull out my phone to charge it (a habit I already had), I see my journal and it reminds me to write. It’s become second nature. I look forward to it. It’s been ten years, and I’ve hardly missed a day. \n\n**DO THE MOST DIFFICULT THING FIRST**\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To change nonessential routines, we should identify and modify the cues triggering those behaviors, associating them with essential activities instead."
