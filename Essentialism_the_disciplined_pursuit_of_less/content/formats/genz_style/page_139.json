  "text": "You can totally use zero-based budgeting for your own projects. Forget about your current commitments and start fresh. Imagine all your past obligations are wiped clean. Now, think about what you’d choose to take on today. This applies to everything—money, projects, even relationships. Every minute, ounce of energy, or resource needs to prove its worth. If it doesn’t fit anymore, cut it out.\n\n**STOP MAKING CASUAL COMMITMENTS**  \nA lot of people fill their days with random commitments they didn’t even mean to make. You know the vibe—chatting with a neighbor about PTA stuff, a colleague about a new project, or a friend about a cool restaurant, and suddenly you’re roped in. \n\n**FROM NOW ON, PAUSE BEFORE YOU SPEAK**  \nIt might seem basic, but taking just five seconds to think before you say “yes” can save you from a commitment you’ll regret. Before you blurt out, “That sounds great, I’d love to,” ask yourself, “Is this essential?” If you’ve already said yes to something you regret, just be honest. Apologize and explain that you didn’t fully get what it would involve when you agreed.\n\n**GET OVER THE FEAR OF MISSING OUT**  \nMany of us are naturally afraid of losing out on opportunities. This fear can hold us back from letting go of commitments that no longer serve us.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Applying zero-based budgeting to personal commitments encourages starting from scratch to evaluate and eliminate nonessential obligations."
