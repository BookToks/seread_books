  "text": "**CHAPTER 18: FLOW**  \n**The Genius of Routine**  \n\nRoutine is a sign of ambition. —W. H. Auden  \n\nBefore Michael Phelps snagged gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, he had a strict routine for every race. He showed up two hours early.  \n\nHe warmed up in a specific order: eight hundred meters of mixing, fifty freestyle, six hundred kicking with a kickboard, and four hundred pulling a buoy. After warming up, he dried off, put in his earphones, and sat—never lay down—on the massage table. From then on, he and his coach, Bob Bowman, wouldn’t talk until after the race.  \n\nForty-five minutes before the race, he suited up. Thirty minutes out, he’d hit the warm-up pool for six to eight hundred meters. With ten minutes left, he’d walk to the ready room. He always sat alone, keeping space on both sides for his gear: goggles on one side, towel on the other.  \n\nWhen his race was called, he’d head to the blocks. He’d stick to his routine: two stretches, starting with a straight-leg stretch and then a bent-knee one. Left leg first, every time. When his name was announced, he’d take out the right earbud. He stepped onto the block from the left side, dried it off—always—and then flapped his arms so his hands hit his back.  \n\nPhelps said, “It’s just a routine. My routine. It’s the routine I’ve gone through my whole life. I’m not going to change it.” 🏊‍♂️\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Michael Phelps' consistent pre-race routine exemplifies how structured habits can lead to success."
