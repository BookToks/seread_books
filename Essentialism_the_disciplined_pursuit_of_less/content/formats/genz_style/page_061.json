  "text": "### Space to Design\n\nCreating space to explore is super important, especially in my work at the d.school at Stanford (officially the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford). When I first walked into the teaching room, I noticed there were no traditional chairs. Instead, there were foam cubes to sit on—pretty uncomfortable, as I quickly found out. But that’s the point! The design encourages students to stand up, move around, and engage with each other, not just the folks sitting next to them. \n\nThe school uses physical space to spark new ways of thinking and interacting. They even have a small hideaway called “Booth Noir.” This room is designed for just one to three people. It’s windowless, soundproof, and distraction-free. As Scott Doorley and Scott Witthoft say in their book *Make Space*, it’s “beyond low-tech. It’s no tech.” You won’t stumble upon it; it’s tucked away on the ground floor, not on the way to anywhere else. The only reason to go there is to think. \n\nBy creating space for thought and focus, students can step back and see things more clearly. There’s a common misconception about focus. People often think of it as just a thing we have. Sure, focus is something we possess, but it’s also something we actively do. To truly focus, we need to escape distractions and find that space.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Creating intentional space for exploration and thinking enhances engagement and clarity in learning environments."
