  "text": "the product and the company. The candidate did well installing the shelving system. But after the day wrapped up, Mark and his team had a concern. When packing up, the candidate just tossed the tools into the box and slammed the lid shut. To us, that might seem like a small mistake—not enough to overshadow a day of great work. But for the team, it showed a lack of care that didn’t match their vision of the ideal hire. Mark listened, agreed, and politely told the candidate he wasn’t the right fit for Vitsoe’s culture. For Mark and his team: \n\nIf it’s not a clear yes, then it’s a clear no. \n\nBut their selective hiring process isn’t just a gut feeling (though that matters too). What seems like a random choice is actually the result of a disciplined, ongoing effort to figure out what works. For example, they found a strong link between how much someone played with Legos as a kid and how well they fit into Vitsoe’s culture. They didn’t just pull that from thin air; they’ve tested all sorts of things over the years—some stuck, but many didn’t.\n\nThe team also uses a clear set of criteria for evaluations. Their main question is, “Will this person be a natural fit?” That’s why they have multiple interviews and a workday trial run. It’s why they send out a questionnaire. Like any true Essentialist, they’re gathering relevant info to make smart, deliberate decisions.\n\nBox CEO Aaron Levie has a similar hiring rule. He simply asks if the person is someone he’d want to work with every day.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Vitsoe's selective hiring process emphasizes finding candidates who align perfectly with their company culture and standards."
