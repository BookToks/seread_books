  "text": "Start with leaders and create a risk management plan. For example, Erwann worked with the World Bank to find the most vulnerable countries. Morocco, ranked 58 out of 85, now has a plan to tackle risks.\n\nWhen Erwann teams up with national governments to craft these strategies, he recommends starting with five key questions:  \n1. What risks are we facing, and where?  \n2. What assets and people are at risk, and how much?  \n3. How vulnerable are they?  \n4. What financial strain do these risks put on individuals, businesses, and the government?  \n5. How can we invest to lower risks and boost economic and social strength?\n\nYou can use these five questions for your own projects, whether at work or home. Think about your most important task and ask:  \n1. What risks do I face?  \n2. What’s the worst-case scenario?  \n3. What social impact could this have?  \n4. What financial fallout might occur?  \n5. How can I invest to reduce risks or build resilience?  \n\nYour answer to the fifth question is key. It might mean adding 20% to your budget, hiring a PR person to handle bad press, or calling a meeting to manage shareholder expectations. These buffers help protect you from the unexpected.\n\nEssentialists know we can’t predict every outcome. Instead, they create buffers to ease the bumps caused by surprises.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialists create buffers to mitigate risks and uncertainties in projects, acknowledging the unpredictability of the future."
