Back in the day, when we lived in tribes, fitting in was crucial for survival. Even though we don't face life-or-death situations anymore, that urge to conform is still strong.\n\nThis is why, whether it’s an old friend inviting you to dinner, a boss asking you to take on a big project, or a neighbor begging for help with the PTA bake sale, saying no can feel really uncomfortable. We feel guilty. We don’t want to let anyone down or mess up relationships. But these feelings cloud our judgment. The truth is, if we say no, we might regret it for a few minutes.

One of the secrets of productivity is…”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Our innate fear of social awkwardness often prevents us from saying no to nonessential requests, but learning to do so can lead to greater respect and clarity in our lives."
