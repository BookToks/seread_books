  "text": "I used to deliver newspapers in the U.S. It was a grind‚Äîshoving papers into a tiny mailbox. I earned my pocket money the hard way. \n\nThat effort changed how I viewed the cost of things I wanted. I started thinking about purchases in terms of how many days of delivering papers it took to afford them. One pound meant one hour of work. I realized saving for that MicroMachine toy would take a while.\n\nThen I had a lightbulb moment: instead of just delivering papers, I could wash neighbors‚Äô cars on Saturday mornings. I charged two pounds per car and could clean three in an hour. Suddenly, my earnings jumped from 1:1 to 1:6. I learned that some efforts pay off way more than others.\n\nYears later, in college, I worked at a coaching company‚Äôs customer service for $9 an hour. It was tempting to think about that job in terms of time and pay. But I knew the real goal was about time and results.\n\nSo, I asked myself, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best result I can get here?‚Äù It turned out winning back customers who wanted to cancel was key. I focused on convincing them to stay and soon had a zero cancellation rate. Since I got paid for each client I kept, I learned more, earned more, and contributed more.\n\nPutting in hard work matters, but more effort doesn‚Äôt always mean better results. ‚ÄúLess but better‚Äù is the way to go.\n\nFerran Adri√†, one of the best chefs ever, shows this perfectly. At El Bulli, he takes traditional dishes and strips them down to their essence, then reimagines them in new ways. Plus, even though he gets about 2 million dinner requests a year, he only serves 50 people a night and takes six months off each year. At one point, he even stopped serving food altogether to focus on food innovation. üçΩÔ∏è\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Effort does not always correlate with results, and focusing on \"less but better\" can yield greater rewards."
