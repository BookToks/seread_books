  "text": "The Big Picture  \nOn December 29, 1972, Eastern Air Lines Flight 401 crashed into the Florida Everglades, killing over a hundred people. 😢 It was the first crash of a wide-body aircraft and one of the worst airline disasters in U.S. history. Investigators were stunned to find that the plane was in perfect working order. So, what went wrong?  \n\nThe Lockheed jet was getting ready to land when first officer Albert Stockstill noticed that the landing gear indicator—a small green light showing the nose gear was locked—hadn’t lit up. But the gear was locked; the issue was just with the light. While the crew fixated on that indicator, they didn’t realize the autopilot was off until it was too late. The nose gear wasn’t the problem; it was their failure to see the bigger issue—the plane’s altitude.  \n\nBeing the journalist of your own life means you have to stop sweating the small stuff and start seeing the big picture. You can use journalist skills in any field—even your personal life. By training yourself to look for “the lead,” you’ll start noticing what you’ve been missing. Instead of just seeing the daily details, you’ll connect the dots to spot trends. You’ll move from just reacting to facts to focusing on the bigger issues that truly matter. 🧐\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The crash of Eastern Air Lines Flight 401 illustrates the danger of losing sight of the bigger picture by focusing too much on minor details."
