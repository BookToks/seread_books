  "text": "Some companies let employees come in late if they stayed late the night before. These leaders get that “protecting their assets” means looking after their team’s well-being. \n\nI recently checked out Google’s famous nap pods for some book research. Picture a white spaceship pod, kind of like something from that old show *Mork and Mindy*. It was about twenty square feet—big enough to lie down but not fully flat. It had a dome cover that hid most of my body, which made me a bit self-conscious at first. I wasn’t sure if I could actually fall asleep. But after thirty minutes, the pod gently vibrated to signal my nap was over, and I didn’t have to wonder anymore.\n\nWhen I woke up, I felt how much I needed that nap. I was clearer, sharper, and way more alert. \n\nTo use the pods at Google, you sign up on a calendar. I wondered how many people used it that week. On a floor of fifty people, I figured at least ten or twenty would take advantage. Nope. Only one person had signed up for a recharge with thirty minutes of midday sleep. Still, just having the pod there sends a strong message: sleep matters.\n\nOur top priority? Protecting our ability to prioritize. \n\nIn this part of the book, we’re diving into how to explore and weigh options to figure out what’s essential versus what’s just noise. This is all about prioritization—filtering out the options that seem good at first but aren’t really worth your time.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Companies like Google emphasize the importance of sleep to enhance employee productivity and prioritization."
