  "text": "Seven students were asked how long they thought their senior thesis would take. When asked for their best-case estimate, they said 27.4 days. But when asked for their worst-case guess, they estimated 48.6 days. In reality, it took them an average of 55.5 days. Only 30% finished on time. \n\nInterestingly, people often underestimate how long things take while still believing their estimates are spot on. ðŸ¤” \n\nOne reason for this gap? Social pressure. A study showed that when people estimated time anonymously, they stopped falling for the planning fallacy (the tendency to think things will take less time than they actually do). \n\nThis suggests that we know we canâ€™t always meet our timelines, but we donâ€™t want to admit it to others. The result? We end up being lateâ€”whether itâ€™s to meetings, work deadlines, or paying bills. Execution becomes frustrating when it could be smooth. \n\nTo combat this, add a 50% buffer to your time estimates. If you think a task will take an hour, block off an extra 30 minutes. If you think getting to soccer practice will take 10 minutes, leave 15 minutes early. This helps reduce stress about being late (imagine how much easier traffic would feel if you werenâ€™t rushed). Plus, if you finish faster than expected (which is rare), that extra time feels like a win! ðŸŽ‰ \n\n**CONDUCT SCENARIO PLANNING**  \nErwann Michel-Kerjan, director of the Risk Management and Decision Processes Center at Wharton, suggests that everyone...\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** People tend to underestimate the time required to complete tasks due to social pressure and the planning fallacy, leading to frequent delays."
