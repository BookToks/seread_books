To gain wisdom, subtract things every day.” —Lao-tzu  \n\nIn the business story *The Goal*, Alex Rogo is a fictional character drowning in the stress of saving a failing production plant in just three months. 😰 At first, he thinks it’s impossible. Then, a mentor steps in and tells him he can make huge strides quickly if he finds the plant’s “constraints.” Constraints are the roadblocks holding everything back. Even if he improves everything else, if he doesn’t tackle these constraints, the plant won’t really get better.  \n\nWhile grappling with this advice, Alex goes hiking with his son and some friends. As the Scout leader, it’s his job to get all the boys to the campsite before dark. But anyone who’s hiked with a group of young boys knows it’s trickier than it sounds. Alex quickly faces a challenge: some Scouts are speedy while others lag behind. One boy, Herbie, is the slowest. The distance between the fast hikers and Herbie grows to miles.  \n\nInitially, Alex tries to fix this by having the fast group stop and wait for the others. This keeps everyone together for a bit, but as soon as they start walking again, the gap reappears.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To achieve significant improvement, one must identify and address the constraints that hinder progress."
