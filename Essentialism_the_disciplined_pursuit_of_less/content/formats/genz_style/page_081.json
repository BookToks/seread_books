  "text": "Stress can mess with your brain. When youâ€™re overwhelmed, your mind gets foggy. You lose your keys, bump into stuff, and forget important things. Research shows that stress ramps up activity in your amygdala (the emotional center) while slowing down your hippocampus (the part that helps with thinking). The result? You canâ€™t think straight. \n\nIâ€™ve seen how play can flip this around with my kids. When theyâ€™re stressed, I have them draw. Almost instantly, the stress fades, and they can explore ideas again.\n\nEdward M. Hallowell, a psychiatrist who knows brain science, says play boosts your brain's executive functions. These skillsâ€”like planning, prioritizing, and decision-makingâ€”are crucial for success in business. ðŸ§  \n\nPlay fires up the brain areas for both logical thinking and free exploration. So, it makes sense that some of historyâ€™s biggest ideas came during playtime. Hallowell points out that Columbus was playing when he realized the world was round. Newton had his breakthrough about gravity while pondering under an apple tree. Watson and Crick were goofing around with DNA shapes when they discovered the double helix. Shakespeare and Mozart were always playing with their art. Even Einsteinâ€™s thought experiments show how a playful mind can lead to genius. ðŸŽ¨âœ¨\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Play enhances cognitive function and creativity, helping to alleviate stress and stimulate innovative thinking."
