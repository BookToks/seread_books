  "text": "In a piece called \"Laugh, Kookaburra\" in The New Yorker, David Sedaris shares a funny story about his trip through the Australian bush. While hiking, his friend and guide drops some wisdom she picked up in a management class. She says to imagine a four-burner stove. Each burner stands for a different part of your life: one for work, one for family, one for friends, and one for yourself. \n\nThis idea highlights how we can only focus on a few things at once. If you try to heat up all four burners, youâ€™ll end up with a mess. Itâ€™s about knowing where to put your energy. ðŸ”¥\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialists explore and evaluate a wide range of options before making commitments, unlike Nonessentialists who react to everything and end up exploring less."
