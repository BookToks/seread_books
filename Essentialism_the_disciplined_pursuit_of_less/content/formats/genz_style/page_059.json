  "text": "### CHAPTER 5  \n**ESCAPE**  \n**The Perks of Being Unavailable**  \n\n\"Without great solitude, no serious work is possible.\" — Pablo Picasso  \n\nFrank O’Brien runs a marketing company called Conversations in New York. It’s made the Inc. 500/5000 list of America’s fastest-growing private companies. To tackle the crazy pace of today’s work life, he’s introduced a bold practice.  \n\nOnce a month, he gathers all fifty employees for a full day. No phones. No emails. No agenda. The goal? Just to think and talk. And he doesn’t pick a lazy Friday when productivity is low. He chooses the first Monday of the month. Clients know not to expect replies on this “Do-Not-Call-Monday.” 📅  \n\nHe understands that his team can’t figure out what truly matters if they’re always on call. They need room to think. He says, \"It’s critical to set aside time to breathe, look around, and think. You need that clarity to innovate and grow.\"  \n\nPlus, this meeting acts as a reality check. If someone can’t attend because they’re too busy, it signals a problem. He notes, \"If they can’t make it due to too much going on, we’re either inefficient or need more people.\" If his team is too swamped to think, they’re just too swamped.  \n\nWe all need space to escape and figure out the essential from the trivial. Sadly, in our time-crunched lives, we often don’t get that chance. ⏳\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Frank O’Brien's practice of designating a day for employees to think and talk without distractions highlights the necessity of solitude to identify what is truly essential in a fast-paced work environment."
