  "text": "**CHAPTER 8: SLEEP  \nProtect the Asset**\n\nEvery night, when I go to sleep, I die. Then, when I wake up, Iâ€™m reborn.  \nâ€”Mahatma Gandhi\n\nGeoff shot up in bed, panicking. It felt like a bomb went off in his head. He was sweating and confused. What was happening? Everything was silent. Was it something he ate? He tried to drift off again.\n\nThe next night, it hit him again. A few days later, it struck in the middle of the day. Just back from India, he thought it might be a side effect of the malaria meds he was taking with Benadryl for jet lag. But as things got worse, he realized it was something deeper. It felt like anxiety attacks without any actual anxietyâ€”just the physical symptoms.\n\nGeoff was the ultimate overachiever, driven to make a difference (his granddad was an early Peace Corps admin). He was ambitious and dedicated: on the board of Kiva, named Ernst & Youngâ€™s Entrepreneur of the Year, recognized as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum, co-founder of a successful impact investment fund, and CEO of a global microcredit organization helping over 12 million poor families worldwide. At thirty-six, he was crushing it.\n\nBut constant travel made sleep a challenge. ðŸ˜´\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Geoff, a high-achieving CEO, experiences severe health issues due to his relentless travel and lack of sleep."
