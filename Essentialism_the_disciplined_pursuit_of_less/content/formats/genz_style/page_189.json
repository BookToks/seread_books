He sticks to this routine every week, no exceptions. Over time, people catch on and can plan their meetings and requests around it.\n\n**TACKLE YOUR ROUTINES ONE BY ONE**\n\nDon’t get so obsessed with the idea of routine that you try to change everything at once. Remember, big results come from small steps. So, pick one change in your daily or weekly routine and start there.\n\nI’m not saying this is easy. Many of our old routines are tied to strong emotions and experiences. Thinking we can just switch them out like that? That’s unrealistic. Learning new, essential skills takes effort. But once you nail them and make them second nature, you’ve achieved something huge. Those skills stick with you for life. The same goes for routines. Once they’re set, they keep giving back. 🎁\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Establishing and mastering essential routines one at a time can lead to lasting benefits and greater focus amid chaos."
