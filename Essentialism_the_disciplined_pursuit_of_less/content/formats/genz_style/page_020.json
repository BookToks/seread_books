  "text": "Psychologists call it “decision fatigue”: the more choices we have to make, the worse our decisions get. 😩\n\n**TOO MUCH SOCIAL PRESSURE**  \nIt’s not just that we have too many choices; it’s also that outside influences are stronger than ever. We’re hyperconnected, and while that can be distracting, the real issue is the social pressure that comes with it. Technology makes it super easy for others to weigh in on what we should focus on. It’s not just info overload; it’s opinion overload.\n\n**THE IDEA THAT “YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL”**  \nThe belief that we can have it all and do it all is nothing new. This myth has been around for so long that almost everyone today has caught it. It’s pushed in ads, celebrated in companies, and found in job listings that demand long lists of skills and experiences. College applications expect tons of extracurriculars, too.\n\nWhat’s new is how damaging this myth is today. With choices and expectations skyrocketing, people are stressed, trying to fit even more into their already packed schedules. Companies talk about work/life balance but still expect employees to be glued to their phones 24/7. Meetings often feature ten “top priorities” without a hint of irony.\n\nThe word \"priority\" came into English in the 1400s as a singular term, meaning the very first thing. For 500 years, it stayed singular. Only in the 1900s did we start using \"priorities\" and thought we could have multiple “first” things. People and companies often try to do just that. One leader shared how his company discussed...\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The overwhelming number of choices and social pressures today lead to decision fatigue and the false belief that we can have and do it all."
