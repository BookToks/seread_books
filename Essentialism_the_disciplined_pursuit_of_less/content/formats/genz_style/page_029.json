  "text": "**STEP 3. EXECUTE: REMOVE OBSTACLES AND MAKE IT EASY**\n\nWhen we want to finish a work project, climb the career ladder, or throw a birthday bash for our partner, we often see execution as a tough grind. It feels like we have to push hard to “make it happen.” But here’s the Essentialist twist: instead of forcing it, Essentialists focus on building a system that clears away obstacles, making execution smooth and effortless. \n\nThink of it this way: the three steps—explore, eliminate, execute—aren't just one-off tasks; they’re a cycle. When we keep applying this cycle, we unlock bigger and better rewards. 🌟\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The Essentialist approach focuses on creating systems to remove obstacles and simplify execution rather than forcing it."
