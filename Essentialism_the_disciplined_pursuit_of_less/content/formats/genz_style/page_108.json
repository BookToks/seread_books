  "text": "**ELIMINATE**  \n**How Can We Cut Out the Trivial Many?**  \n\nThink back to the closet metaphor from chapter 1. By now, you’ve sorted your stuff into “must keep” and “probably should get rid of.” But are you actually ready to bag up that “probably should get rid of” pile and send it off?  \n\nIt’s not enough to just figure out which activities aren’t helping you shine. You need to actively ditch the nonessentials. Part Three of this book will teach you how to cut out the fluff so you can focus on what really matters. Plus, you’ll learn to do it in a way that earns you more respect from your colleagues, bosses, clients, and peers. 🙌  \n\nLetting go of those old clothes is tough. There’s always that annoying “what if” nagging at you—what if you regret giving away that blazer with the big shoulder pads and loud pinstripes? This feeling is totally normal. Studies show we tend to overvalue what we own, making it harder to part with. If you’re struggling to let go of that metaphorical blazer, ask yourself this killer question: “If I didn’t already own this, how much would I pay to buy it?”  \n\nSimilarly, when deciding what activities to cut, ask: “If I didn’t have this opportunity, what would I be willing to do to get it?”  \n\nSaying no to opportunities—often good ones—can be way harder than tossing out old clothes. But you need to find that discipline. Remember, every time you don’t say “no” to something nonessential, you’re saying yes by default. So, once you’ve got enough clarity…\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To make a higher level of contribution, it is essential to actively eliminate nonessential activities and opportunities from your life."
