  "text": "Efforts don’t come with an expiration date. If we don’t have a plan to clear them out, they’ll stick around forever. Here’s how an Essentialist would tackle that closet.\n\n1. **EXPLORE AND EVALUATE**  \nInstead of asking, “Will I wear this someday?” get real with yourself. Ask, “Do I love this?” “Do I look great in it?” “Do I wear this often?” If the answer is no, it’s time to let it go.  \nIn life, this means asking, “Will this activity help me reach my goals?” Part One of this book will help you figure out what those activities are.\n\n2. **ELIMINATE**  \nImagine you’ve sorted your clothes into “must keep” and “probably should get rid of.” But are you ready to toss the “probably should get rid of” stuff? It’s tough because of sunk-cost bias (basically, we value what we own more than it’s worth). If you’re hesitating, ask yourself, “If I didn’t own this, how much would I pay for it?” That usually helps.  \nIt’s not enough to just find what doesn’t contribute to your goals; you actually have to get rid of it. Part Two of this book will show you how to eliminate the nonessentials and earn respect while doing it.\n\n3. **EXECUTE**  \nTo keep your closet organized, you need a routine. Have one big bag for stuff to throw away and a small pile for what you want to keep. You need to know the drill.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** An Essentialist approach involves exploring, evaluating, eliminating, and executing to focus on activities that contribute the most to one's goals."
