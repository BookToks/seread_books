  "text": "We often throw time and energy into losing causes just because we’ve already spent money or effort that we can’t get back. This can trap us in a cycle: the more we invest, the more we feel we have to stick it out to make it worth it. Take the Concorde, for example. It cost about $1 billion to develop. The more money the British and French governments put in, the harder it was to walk away. \n\nPeople are just as prone to this sunk-cost bias. Ever sat through a terrible movie just because you bought a ticket? Or kept sinking cash into a home renovation that never finishes? Maybe you've waited forever for a bus that never shows up instead of just grabbing a cab. And then there’s the story of Henry Gribbohm, who blew his life savings—$2,600—at a carnival game trying to win an Xbox Kinect. The more he spent, the more he felt he had to win it back. He said, “You just get caught up in the whole ‘I’ve got to win my money back,’ but it didn’t turn out that way.” The more he invested in that pointless game, the harder it was to walk away.\n\nHave you ever kept pouring time or effort into a project that wasn’t worth it? Or kept spending on a bad investment instead of cutting your losses? Maybe you’ve trudged down a dead-end path, unable to admit, “I shouldn’t have gone this way in the first place.” Ever felt stuck in a cycle of “throwing good money after bad”? A Nonessentialist can’t break free from these traps. But an Essentialist has the guts to admit mistakes and uncommit, no matter what they’ve already invested. \n\n**Nonessentialist**: “Why stop now when I’ve already put so much in?”  \n**Essentialist**: “If I weren’t already invested in this project, how much would I invest now?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sunk-cost bias leads individuals to continue investing in losing propositions, while Essentialists have the courage to cut their losses and uncommit."
