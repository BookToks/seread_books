  "text": "right. Editing can be as simple as fixing grammar or as complex as reshaping an argument. To do it well, an editor needs to grasp the main purpose of what they’re working on. Michael Kahn, for example, doesn’t just follow Spielberg’s orders; he figures out what Spielberg really wants. This understanding lets him make changes that even Spielberg might not articulate. \n\nIn our own lives, whether at work or home, we can also make adjustments by sticking to our core purpose. Having a clear intent (like we talked about in chapter 10) helps us check in on ourselves—are our actions aligning with our true goals? If not, it's time to edit.\n\nEDIT LESS  \nThis might sound weird, but the best editors don’t feel the need to change everything. They know that sometimes, it’s smarter to leave things as they are. This is part of their skill. Just like the best surgeon isn’t the one who cuts the most, the best editors can be the ones who make the fewest changes.\n\nBeing an editor in our lives means knowing when to hold back. For instance, when we join an email thread, we can resist the urge to jump in first. In meetings, we can hold off on sharing our thoughts right away. We can observe and see how things unfold. Doing less isn’t just a smart Essentialist move; it’s a solid editing strategy too.\n\nA Nonessentialist tends to see editing as something to do only when things get too chaotic. But waiting too long to edit can force us into making big cuts we didn’t want. By continuously refining our time and activities, we can make smaller, intentional tweaks along the way. Embracing Essentialism means making these adjustments regularly.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Becoming an Essentialist involves continuously editing our lives by aligning our activities with our core purpose and knowing when to show restraint."
