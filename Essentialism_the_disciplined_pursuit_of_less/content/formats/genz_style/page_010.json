  "text": "The Way of the Essentialist\n\nDieter Rams was the main designer at Braun for years. He believed most things are just noise. To him, only a few things are truly essential. His job? Cut through the noise to find the essence. \n\nWhen he was just 24, he was asked to work on a record player. Back then, the norm was to cover it with a solid wooden lid or integrate it into living room furniture. But Rams and his team stripped away the clutter and created a player with just a clear plastic cover on top. It was a bold move—so bold that people thought it might bankrupt the company because no one would buy it. But it took guts to ditch the nonessential. By the 60s, this minimalist look started to catch on and eventually became the standard for all record players.\n\nDieter's design philosophy can be summed up in three German words: Weniger aber besser, which means \"Less but better.\" This perfectly captures the essence of Essentialism.\n\nThe way of the Essentialist is all about the relentless pursuit of less but better. It’s not just about occasionally saying “no” or cleaning out your inbox. It’s about constantly asking yourself, “Am I investing my time in the right activities?” There are way more activities and opportunities than we can handle. While many might be good or even great, most are trivial, and only a few are vital. The Essentialist learns to spot the difference—filtering through options to choose only what truly matters.\n\nEssentialism isn’t about getting more done; it’s about getting the right things done. It’s not just about doing less for the sake of it either. It’s about making the smartest possible investment of your time and energy. 💡\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The way of the Essentialist is the disciplined pursuit of less but better, focusing on identifying and investing in truly essential activities."
