Did you think, ‚ÄúIs this going to be a good ticket or a bad one?‚Äù Probably not. We all know tickets are bad news, right? But one police precinct in Richmond, Canada, is flipping that idea on its head.\n\nTraditionally, the way to tackle crime has been to create tougher laws and harsher punishments. Basically, just do more of what we‚Äôve always done, but with a heavier hand. The Richmond Police Department followed this playbook for years, and guess what? Recidivism (repeat offenses) was at 65%, and youth crime was on the rise. That changed when a fresh-thinking superintendent, Ward Clapham, stepped in.\n\nHe asked a game-changing question: Why are we always reacting to crime instead of preventing it? What if, instead of just punishing criminals after the fact, the police focused on stopping crime before it happens? To quote Tony Blair, what if they could be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime?\n\nThis led to a groundbreaking idea: Positive Tickets. Instead of just catching kids doing wrong, the police would reward young people for doing something good. üéüÔ∏è\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The Richmond Police Department implemented a \"Positive Tickets\" program to encourage good behavior among youth instead of solely punishing criminal acts."
