  "text": "Instead of going all out at the start and ending up with nothing but wasted time and energy, we should kick things off small and build momentum. That momentum helps us tackle the next win, and the next one, and so on, until we hit a major breakthrough. When that happens, our progress will feel so smooth and easy that it’ll seem like it happened overnight. \n\nAs former Stanford professor Henry B. Eyring put it, “My experience has taught me this about how people and organizations improve: the best place to look is for small changes we could make in the things we do often.” There’s real power in being steady and repeating actions. \n\nWhen I had lunch with Dr. Phil Zimbardo, the former president of the American Psychological Association, I mainly knew him as the guy behind the famous Stanford prison experiment. In the summer of 1971, he took healthy Stanford students, gave them roles as either “guards” or “inmates,” and locked them in a makeshift prison. 🏫\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To achieve significant breakthroughs, we should start small to build momentum, leading to effortless progress over time."
