  "text": "**CHAPTER 7**  \n**PLAY**  \n**Embrace the Wisdom of Your Inner Child**\n\n“A little nonsense now and then is cherished by the wisest men.” — Roald Dahl\n\nIn the classic musical *Mary Poppins*, Mr. Banks comes home after getting fired. Instead of being upset, he’s weirdly happy—so much so that one servant thinks he’s lost it, and even his son notices, “It doesn’t sound like Father.” Mr. Banks is practically a new man as he gives his kids a repaired kite and breaks into the song “Let’s Go Fly a Kite.” Free from his boring bank job, his inner child bursts out. This good vibe lifts everyone in the house, turning the gloomy Banks family into a joyful one. It’s a fictional story, sure, but it shows how important play is in our lives.\n\nMost of us didn’t get a formal education on how to play as kids; we just figured it out naturally. Think about a baby’s pure joy during a game of peekaboo. Or a group of kids diving into their imaginations with make-believe games. Picture a child in “flow” (that awesome state of total focus) as they build a mini-kingdom from cardboard boxes.\n\nBut then we grow up, and things change. We start hearing that play is pointless. It’s a waste of time. It’s childish. Sadly, many of these negative vibes come from the very places where we should be encouraged to play.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Restoring play to our lives can rejuvenate our spirits and foster joy and creativity."
