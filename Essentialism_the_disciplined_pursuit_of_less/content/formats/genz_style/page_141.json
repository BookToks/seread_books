  "text": "**CHAPTER 13: EDIT**  \n*The Invisible Art*  \n\n“I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free.” —Michelangelo  \n\nEvery year at the Oscars, the biggest buzz is around “Best Picture.” The media talks about it for weeks, and viewers stay up late just to see who wins. But there’s another award that gets way less attention: Best Film Editing. Let’s be real—most people change the channel or head to the kitchen for more popcorn when that one gets announced.  \n\nHere’s the kicker: the two awards are super connected. Since 1981, no film has won Best Picture without at least a nomination for Film Editing. In fact, about two-thirds of the time, the film nominated for Film Editing goes on to snag Best Picture. 📽️  \n\nWhen it comes to film editors, Michael Kahn is the real deal. He has eight nominations—more than anyone else—and three wins. Not exactly a household name, but the films he’s worked on are legendary: *Saving Private Ryan*, *Raiders of the Lost Ark*, *Schindler’s List*, and *Lincoln*. For over thirty-seven years, he’s edited almost all of Steven Spielberg’s films, becoming his go-to guy. Still, only a few people know who Kahn is. That’s why film editing is often called the “invisible art.”  \n\nEditing is all about cutting out the unnecessary stuff. It’s a true Essentialist skill. So, what makes a great editor?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Film editing, often overlooked, is a crucial \"invisible art\" that embodies the Essentialist principle of eliminating the trivial to highlight what truly matters."
