When the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences picks nominees for film editing, they really try not to get distracted by everything else. 🎬 \n\nA solid film editor highlights what’s important by cutting out everything unnecessary. \n\nIn Chapter 6, we compared exploring to being a journalist—asking questions, listening, and connecting the dots to figure out what really matters. So, it makes sense that the next step in becoming an Essentialist is to play editor in your life and leadership.\n\nJack Dorsey, the guy behind Twitter and Square, has a unique take on management. At a dinner I attended, he described being a CEO as being the chief editor of the company. He said, “There are a thousand things we could be doing, but only one or two that really matter. Ideas and input from engineers, support teams, and designers are always coming in, and as an editor, I’m constantly deciding which ones make sense for us.” \n\nBeing an editor isn’t just about saying no. Even a toddler can do that. An editor doesn’t just cut things out; they actually add value. A good editor uses deliberate subtraction to breathe life into ideas, settings, plots, and characters.\n\nIn your life, disciplined editing boosts your contribution. It helps you focus on what really matters and gives your meaningful relationships and activities room to grow. Editing makes it easier to execute the Essentialist mindset by removing distractions and unnecessary stuff. As one book editor put it: “My job is to make life as effortless as possible for the reader. The goal is to help them grasp the most important message or takeaway.” 📚\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A good editor enhances clarity and focus by eliminating nonessential elements, allowing the most important ideas to shine through."
