I can’t respond like I want to, and I’m sorry about that.—Greg.” And guess what? Everyone handled my absence just fine. \n\n5. Say, “Yes. What should I deprioritize?”  \nTelling a senior leader “no” feels impossible for many people. But if saying yes means you can’t do your best work, then you have to say no. It’s not just okay; it’s necessary. A smart way to do this is to remind your boss what you’d be dropping if you take on the new task. \n\nFor example, if your manager asks you to do X, respond with, “Sure, I can prioritize this. Which of my other projects should I deprioritize?” Or simply say, “I want to do great work, but with my current commitments, I can’t give this the attention it deserves.” \n\nI know a leader who got this kind of response from a team member. He didn’t want to disrupt that organized employee, so he handed the extra project to someone else who was less on top of things!\n\n6.

It’s a solid way to handle requests you want to support but can’t fully commit to. \n\nI like this approach because it respects both your choices and the other person’s. It reminds everyone that there are options available. \n\n8. “I can’t do it, but X might be interested.”  \nIt’s easy to think that...\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialists develop a repertoire of responses to gracefully say no to requests that compromise their priorities."
