Here are some easy tips to help you out. \n\n**FIGURE OUT WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW**\n\nI recently led a full day on Essentialism for an executive team in New York. I had a blast and felt totally present. But once I got back to my room, I felt pulled in a million directions. My surroundings screamed at me: check emails, listen to messages, read that book I felt I had to finish, prep for a presentation weeks away, jot down cool ideas from the day, and so much more. It wasn’t just the sheer number of tasks that felt overwhelming; it was that familiar stress of everything demanding my attention at once. \n\nAs anxiety kicked in, I paused. I knelt down, closed my eyes, and asked myself, “What’s important now?” After a moment, I realized that to figure out what mattered right now, I first had to identify what was truly important.\n\nI stood up, tidied my space, and put everything away so it wouldn’t distract me every time I walked by. I turned off my phone—such a relief to block out those texts! I opened my journal and wrote about my day. That helped me center myself. I made a list of everything on my mind and then asked, “What do you need to do to sleep peacefully?” I decided that connecting with my wife and kids was essential. Then I focused on just a few tasks to make the next morning easier: schedule a wake-up call and breakfast in my room, load my slides onto the computer, and iron my shirt. I crossed off everything else that wasn’t important right then.\n\nWhen you’re faced with too many tasks and can’t figure out where to start, stop. Take a deep breath. Get present and ask yourself what’s most important this very second.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To be fully present, identify and focus on what is most important right now amidst distractions and obligations."
