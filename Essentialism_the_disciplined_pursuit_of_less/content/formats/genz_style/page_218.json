By checking in regularly to celebrate small wins and help remove roadblocks, they boost the team's motivation and focus, allowing for real progress (check out chapter 17 for more on the power of progress). \n\nLeading with the idea of \"less but better\" helps your team step up their game and achieve something truly amazing. \n\nEla Bhatt, a classic Essentialist and visionary leader, has done incredible things, like winning the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace and founding many organizations to help poor women in India. She says, \"Of all virtues, simplicity is my favorite. I believe simplicity can solve most problems, both personal and global. When life is simple, thereâ€™s less need to lie, argue, steal, envy, or hate. Everyone can have enough, so no one needs to hoard or gamble. When your character shines, youâ€™re beautiful. Thatâ€™s the beauty of simplicity.\" \n\nAnd thatâ€™s the beauty of leading like an Essentialist. ðŸŒŸ\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialist leaders enhance team motivation and progress by focusing on simplicity and prioritizing one key initiative."
