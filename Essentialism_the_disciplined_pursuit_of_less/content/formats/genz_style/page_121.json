  "text": "**CHAPTER 11: DARE**  \n**The Power of a Graceful “No”**\n\nCourage is grace under pressure. —Ernest Hemingway\n\nA well-timed “no” can change everything. Take Rosa Parks, for instance. Her calm refusal to give up her seat on a segregated bus in Montgomery was a turning point for the civil rights movement. She remembered, “When [the bus driver] saw me still sitting, he asked if I was going to stand up, and I said, ‘No, I’m not.’”\n\nContrary to what many think, her brave “no” didn’t come from a super assertive personality. In fact, when she became the secretary for the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP, she admitted, “I was the only woman there, and they needed a secretary, and I was too timid to say no.”\n\nHer decision on the bus was driven by a strong belief in what she wanted to stand for. When the driver told her to move, she felt a determination wash over her, “like a quilt on a winter night.” She had no idea her choice would ignite a global movement, but she was clear about her values. Even as she was being arrested, she knew, “it was the very last time that I would ever ride in humiliation of this kind.” For her, avoiding that humiliation was worth the risk of going to jail. It was essential.\n\nWe might not face a situation like Rosa Parks did, but we can still draw strength from her story. Remember her example when you need the courage to say no. ✊\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The power of a well-timed \"no,\" exemplified by Rosa Parks, can significantly influence history and inspire others to stand firm in their convictions."
