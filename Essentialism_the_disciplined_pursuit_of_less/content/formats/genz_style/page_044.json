  "text": "Getting used to “less but better” can be tougher than it sounds. We’ve been praised for doing more… and more… and more. But eventually, piling on effort leads to a plateau—our progress just stalls. Sure, it feels fair to think that more effort equals better results. But research shows something different.\n\nMost people know about the “Pareto Principle.” This idea, introduced by Vilfredo Pareto in the 1790s, says that 20% of our efforts lead to 80% of our results. Later, Joseph Moses Juran, a quality movement pioneer, called this the “Law of the Vital Few.” He found that fixing a tiny fraction of problems could massively boost product quality. \n\nIn Japan, which had a rep for low-quality goods, Juran’s approach changed everything. By focusing on just a few key issues, the phrase “made in Japan” transformed into a mark of quality. This shift played a huge role in Japan becoming an economic powerhouse.\n\nYou can apply the idea of separating the “trivial many” from the “vital few” to anything in life. Richard Koch has written a bunch about using the Pareto Principle (or 80/20 Rule) in daily life. \n\nLook at Warren Buffett. He famously said, “Our investment philosophy borders on lethargy.” What he means is that he and his firm make a few key investments and hold onto them for a long time. In *The Tao of Warren Buffett*, Mary Buffett and David Clark explain that he realized early on he couldn’t make hundreds of right investment choices. So, he decided to invest only in businesses he was absolutely sure of and then go all in. He owes 90% of his wealth to just ten investments. Sometimes, what you don’t do is just as crucial as what you do. \n\nIn short, Buffett makes big bets on the essential few investment opportunities. 💰\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The concept of \"less but better\" emphasizes that focusing on a few vital efforts can lead to significantly greater results than trying to do more."
