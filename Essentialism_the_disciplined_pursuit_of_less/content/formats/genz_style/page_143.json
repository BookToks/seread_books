  "text": "Editing isn’t just about cutting stuff out; it’s about making tough choices. Instead of cramming everything in—every character, plot twist, and detail—an editor asks, “Does this really make it better?” For creators—whether they're making movies, writing books, or crafting articles—it’s easy to get attached to ideas or pieces of work you’ve poured your heart into. Letting go of passages, pages, or even whole chapters can sting, especially if you spent weeks, months, or even years on them. But this kind of tough love is essential. As Stephen King puts it, “Kill your darlings, kill your darlings, even when it breaks your egocentric little scribbler’s heart, kill your darlings.” 💔\n\nHere’s the difference:\n\n**Nonessentialist**  \n- Thinks improving means adding more.  \n- Gets attached to every word, image, or detail.  \n\n**Essentialist**  \n- Believes improvement comes from subtracting.  \n- Cuts out distractions and clutter.  \n\nEditing a film or book isn’t the same as editing your life. In real life, we can’t rewind a chat we just had or redo a presentation. But the principles of editing still apply when it comes to cutting out the nonessentials in our lives. ✂️\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Editing involves making trade-offs by eliminating nonessential elements to enhance the overall quality of a work."
