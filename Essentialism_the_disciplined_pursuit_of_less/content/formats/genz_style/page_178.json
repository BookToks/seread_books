As John Lasseter, the chief creative officer at Pixar and now Disney, said, “We don’t actually finish our films, we release them.” 🎬\n\n**DO THE MINIMAL VIABLE PREPARATION**\n\nWhen you’re chasing a big goal or deadline, you’ve got two options: start early and small or start late and big. “Late and big” is all about cramming at the last minute—think all-nighters and stress. “Early and small” means kicking things off as soon as you can with the least time commitment.\n\nJust ten minutes spent on a project two weeks before it’s due can save you from a crazy scramble later. So, look at your upcoming goal and ask yourself, “What’s the smallest thing I can do right now to get ready?”\n\nOne inspiring leader preps for his big speeches six months in advance. But he doesn’t write the whole thing; he just starts. If you’ve got a big presentation coming up, open a file now and spend four minutes jotting down any ideas. Then close it. Just four minutes. That’s it. Just get started. \n\nA colleague in New York has a simple hack: whenever she sets up a meeting or call, she spends fifteen seconds writing down the main goals for that meeting. Then, when it’s time to prep talking points, she can refer back to them. No need for a full agenda—just a few seconds of prep can make a huge difference. \n\n**VISUALLY REWARD PROGRESS**\n\nRemember when you were five and your school had a fundraiser? There was that big thermometer showing how close you were to the goal. Watching it rise every day was exciting and motivating, right? Or maybe your parents had a star chart. Every time you ate your spinach or went to bed on time, you got a star. 🌟\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Starting early with minimal preparation can significantly reduce stress and enhance productivity."
