  "text": "**Escape: The Perks of Being Unavailable**\n\nWithout some serious alone time, you can't do serious work. â€”Pablo Picasso\n\nFrank Oâ€™Brien runs a successful marketing company in New York called Conversations. To keep up with the crazy work pace, heâ€™s started a bold practice. Once a month, he gathers all fifty employees in one room for a full day. No phones allowed. ðŸ“µ\n\nOne leader I met realized he stayed at his job five years too long. Why? He was so busy that he never took a minute to think if he even wanted to be there. Daily demands kept him from stepping back and seeing the bigger picture.\n\nA senior VP at a huge tech company told me he spends thirty-five hours a week in meetings. Heâ€™s so caught up in them that he canâ€™t find even an hour a month to plan his own career or think about how to elevate his team. Instead of using that time to discuss what really matters, heâ€™s stuck in endless presentations and pointless meetings where nothing gets decided.\n\nTo figure out whatâ€™s essential, you first need to explore your options. Nonessentialists jump at the latest idea or respond to every email without thinking. Essentialists, on the other hand, carve out time to explore and reflect. \n\n**Nonessentialist vs. Essentialist:**\n- Too busy doing to think about life\n- Creates space to escape and explore life\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Creating space to escape and explore is essential for evaluating what is truly important in life and work."
