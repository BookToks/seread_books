I first shared this in a blog post for Harvard Business Review called “The Disciplined Pursuit of Less,” August 8, 2012, http://blogs.hbr.org/2012/08/the-disciplined-pursuit-of-less/.\n\n10. CLARIFY\n\n1. This exercise and other parts of this chapter were originally published in Harvard Business Review, titled “If I Read One More Platitude-Filled Mission Statement, I’ll Scream,” October 4, 2012.\n\n2. Big shoutout to Gary Hamel and C. K. Prahalad for their awesome piece in Harvard Business Review, “Strategic Intent,” May 1989, http://hbr.org/1989/05/strategic-intent/ar/1. They talked about how Japanese companies aimed to push beyond their limits. Over time, I’ve found this idea super helpful but it’s evolved enough to be called something else: essential intent.\n\n11.

This story pops up in a few spots, but I got this version from my interview with Cynthia Covey in 2012.\n\n6. Stephen R. Covey and Roger and Rebecca Merrill, First Things First.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The chapter emphasizes the importance of clarifying one's essential intent to focus on what truly matters."
