  "text": "The opportunities we chase often arenâ€™t worth the time compared to the few that really matter. Once we get this, we start looking for those vital few and ditch the trivial many. Thatâ€™s how we can say no to good opportunities and yes to the truly great ones. \n\nAn Essentialist takes the time to explore all options. That extra effort pays off because some things are so much more important that they repay the effort tenfold. In short, an Essentialist figures out what matters more so they can do less. \n\n**Nonessentialist vs. Essentialist:**\n\n- Thinks almost everything is essential.\n- Views opportunities as basically equal.\n\n**Essentialist:**\n\n- Thinks almost everything is nonessential.\n- Distinguishes the vital few from the trivial many.\n\nMany capable people struggle to level up because they believe everything is important. But an Essentialist knows how to tell whatâ€™s truly important from the rest. To practice this Essentialist skill, we can start small. Once it becomes second nature for daily decisions, we can apply it to bigger areas in our lives. Mastering this will take a major shift in thinking, but itâ€™s definitely possible. ðŸ’ª\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** An Essentialist focuses on identifying and pursuing the few truly valuable opportunities while eliminating the trivial many."
