  "text": "**The Essential Life: Living a Life That Really Matters**\n\nAn Essentialist's life is all about meaning. It’s a life that truly matters. \n\nWhen I need a wake-up call, I think of this story. A dad lost his three-year-old daughter. In his grief, he made a video of her short life. But as he sifted through his home videos, he noticed something was off. He had tons of footage from their outings and trips—lots of sights, meals, and landmarks. But he barely had any close-ups of his daughter. He was so busy capturing the surroundings that he missed what was truly essential: her. \n\nThis story highlights two big lessons I’ve learned while writing this book. First, my family is everything. In the end, nothing else matters as much. Second, we have a shockingly small amount of time left in our lives. Instead of being depressing, this thought is thrilling. It frees me from the fear of making the wrong choices. It pushes me to be super selective about how I spend my precious (and yes, “precious” feels too tame a word) time. \n\nI know someone who visits cemeteries around the world when he travels. I thought it was strange at first, but now I see it keeps his own mortality front and center. \n\nAn Essentialist lives without regrets. When you know what truly matters and invest your time and energy in it, it’s hard to regret your choices. You feel proud of the life you’ve chosen.\n\nWill you live a life full of purpose and meaning? Or will you look back on your one and only life with regrets? If you take away just one thing from this book, let it be this: when faced with decisions or challenges, ask yourself, “What is essential?” Cut out everything else.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The life of an Essentialist is one of meaning and purpose, focused on what truly matters to avoid regret."
