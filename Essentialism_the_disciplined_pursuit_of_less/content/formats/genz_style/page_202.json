  "text": "**Living Essentially**\n\nThere are two ways to think about Essentialism. First, you can see it as something you do sometimes. Or, you can view it as something you are. The first option just adds more to your already packed life. The second? It’s a whole new vibe—a simpler way to approach everything. It becomes your lifestyle. It shapes who you are at your core.\n\nEssentialism has deep roots in many spiritual and religious traditions. For example, Gautama Buddha left his royal life to seek enlightenment, which led to Buddhism. Similarly, Moses ditched his fancy life in Egypt to live in the wilderness as a shepherd. That’s where he found his calling to lead the Israelites to freedom. \n\nThe Prophet Muhammad lived simply, mending his own clothes and milking goats, teaching his followers to do the same. John the Baptist also embraced a minimalist lifestyle—living in the desert, wearing camel hair, and eating what he could find. Groups like the Quakers practiced “the Testimony of Simplicity,” committing to only what’s essential in life. And Jesus? He was a carpenter who lived without wealth or political power.\n\nThe idea of “less but better” pops up in the lives of many influential figures—both religious and secular. Think of the Dalai Lama, Steve Jobs, Leo Tolstoy, Michael Jordan, Warren Buffett, Mother Teresa, and Henry David Thoreau, who said, “I do believe in simplicity. It’s astonishing how many trivial affairs even the wisest think they must attend to in a day; … so simplify the problem of life, distinguish the necessary and the real.”\n\nEssentialists can be found among the most successful people in every field—religious leaders, journalists, politicians, lawyers, doctors, investors, athletes, and authors. ✨\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialism can be viewed either as an occasional practice or as a fundamental lifestyle that simplifies and defines who we are."
