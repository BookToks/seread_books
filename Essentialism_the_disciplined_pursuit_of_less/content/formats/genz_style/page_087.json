  "text": "**Protecting the Asset**\n\nThe best asset we have for making a difference in the world is ourselves. If we don’t invest in our minds, bodies, and spirits, we’re damaging the very tool we need to contribute at our best. One of the biggest ways people—especially driven, successful ones—hurt this asset is by skimping on sleep. \n\nWhen we let our type A instincts take over, we risk burning out too soon, just like Geoff did. We need to be as strategic about taking care of ourselves as we are about our careers and businesses. It’s all about pacing ourselves, nurturing our well-being, and fueling our ability to explore, thrive, and perform. \n\nDuring his downtime, Geoff realized something interesting about his drive for achievement: for type A personalities, pushing hard is easy. The real challenge? It’s not about working harder. He tells fellow overachievers: “If you think you’re tough enough to do anything, here’s a real challenge: say no to an opportunity so you can take a nap.” 😴\n\nBy the time I was twenty-one, I viewed sleep as something to avoid. To me, it was just a necessary evil—a waste of time better spent being productive. The idea of being superhuman and sleeping only a few hours a night was tempting. I even tried some extreme methods to cut down on sleep. \n\nAfter reading a study where participants slept just twenty minutes every four hours, I gave it a shot. It was okay for a bit, but I quickly realized that while I could survive on that schedule, it had serious downsides. Sure, I was awake, but my brain was barely functioning. Thinking, planning, and prioritizing became tough. Making decisions felt impossible, and distinguishing the essential from the trivial was nearly out of reach. \n\nEventually, it was clear this wasn’t sustainable. But I still held on to the belief that less sleep meant getting more done. So, I started pulling all-nighters.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Investing in our well-being, particularly through adequate sleep, is crucial for maximizing our contributions to the world."
