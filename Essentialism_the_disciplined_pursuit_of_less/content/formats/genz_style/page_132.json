  "text": "**CHAPTER 12**  \n**UNCOMMIT**  \n**Win Big by Cutting Your Losses**  \n\n\"Half of the troubles of this life can be traced to saying yes too quickly and not saying no soon enough.\" —Josh Billings  \n\nThe Concorde jet was a major win in airplane tech. You could fly from London to New York in just under three hours. 🚀 That’s less than half the time of regular flights, making it the fastest passenger plane ever.  \n\nBut here’s the kicker: it was a huge financial flop. Many cool ideas and products fail, but the Concorde was different. It lost money for over forty years straight.  \n\nEvery time costs went up, the French and British governments just kept throwing in more cash. They knew they’d probably never get their money back. With limited seats, few orders, and high production costs, it was obvious the project would never turn a profit.  \n\nWhen old government documents were released, they showed that officials knew the investment \"could not stand on normal economic grounds.\"  \n\nSo why did smart government leaders keep pouring money into a sinking ship? One big reason is something called “sunk-cost bias.”  \n\nSunk-cost bias is when you keep investing time, money, or energy into something just because you’ve already put so much into it.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The Concorde jet exemplifies how sunk-cost bias can lead to continued investment in a failing project despite clear evidence of its financial impracticality."
