  "text": "### EXECUTE  \n**How to Make Execution Effortless**  \n\nThere are two ways to think about execution. Nonessentialists push through it, while Essentialists use the time they save by cutting out the fluff to create a system that makes execution almost effortless.  \n\nRemember in chapter 1 when we compared life to a cluttered closet? An Essentialist knows how to organize it. To keep your closet tidy, you need a regular routine. Get one big bag for stuff to toss and a tiny pile for what you want to keep. Know where your local thrift store is and when it‚Äôs open. Schedule a time to drop things off. üóëÔ∏è  \n\nIn short, once you know which activities matter, you need a system to execute them. Don‚Äôt wait until your closet is overflowing and then try to clean it all at once. Set up a system so keeping it neat becomes a habit‚Äîeasy and effortless.  \n\nIt‚Äôs human nature to want to do what‚Äôs easy. In this part of the book, you‚Äôll learn how to make executing the right things‚Äîthe essential things‚Äîas smooth as possible. ‚ú®\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialists create systems to make the execution of essential tasks effortless, contrasting with Nonessentialists who force execution."
