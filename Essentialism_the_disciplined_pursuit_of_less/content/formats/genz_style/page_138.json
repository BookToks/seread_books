  "text": "Looking back, the more I tried to make things work, the worse they got. But instead of stepping back, I kept pouring in more effort. I thought, “I can fix this!” I didn’t want to admit I was wasting my time. Finally, I vented to a friend who wasn’t emotionally tied to the project. They didn’t have the baggage of past efforts and could see things clearly. After listening, they said, “You’re not married to this.” That hit me hard. With those words, I finally felt free to stop investing in something that wasn’t worth it.\n\n**WATCH OUT FOR STATUS QUO BIAS**  \nThis is the habit of sticking with something just because it’s always been done that way. I once worked at a company with an outdated employee evaluation system. I got curious about how long it had been in place. When I asked around, even the head of HR didn’t know where it came from. Shockingly, in her ten years there, no one had ever questioned it. It’s way too easy to just accept things without thinking, especially if they’re already in place.\n\nOne way to break free from this bias is to use a method from accounting:  \n\n**TRY ZERO-BASED BUDGETING**  \nNormally, accountants build budgets based on last year’s numbers. But with zero-based budgeting, you start from zero. Every item in the budget has to be justified from scratch. Sure, it takes more work, but it has big perks: it helps allocate resources based on current needs, sniffs out inflated budget requests, highlights outdated practices, and pushes people to clarify their goals and how their spending lines up with those goals.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Admitting mistakes and questioning established commitments can liberate us from nonessential investments and improve decision-making."
