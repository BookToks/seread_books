  "text": "To get what an essential intent is, let’s first see what it isn’t. \n\nIn the top left corner, we have those grand mission statements like “We want to change the world.” They sound cool but are so vague that nobody really pays attention. In the bottom left, you find general values like “innovation” and “leadership.” These are nice words but don’t really inspire action.\n\nOn the flip side, in the bottom right, we have those short-term goals, like “Increase profits by 5% this year.” These might grab our attention, but they often lack any real motivation. \n\nNow, an essential intent? That’s both inspiring and clear. It’s meaningful and measurable. Think of it like choosing to become a doctor instead of a lawyer. That one big choice cuts out tons of other options and sets you on a clear path for the next five, ten, or even twenty years. Once you make that major decision, everything else becomes way easier to figure out.\n\nHere’s a quick breakdown:\n\n**Nonessentialist:**\n- Has a vague mission.\n- Sets concrete quarterly goals but lacks inspiration.\n- Has values but no clear guiding principles.\n\n**Essentialist:**\n- Has a clear, inspiring strategy.\n- Intent is both meaningful and memorable.\n- Makes one decision that simplifies a thousand later choices.\n\nTake Martha Lane Fox, for example. When the British prime minister asked her to be the U.K.’s first “Digital Champion,” she could have gone with some boring, jargon-filled description. Instead, she and her team nailed it with this essential intent: “To get everyone in the U.K. online by the end of 2012.” \n\nThat’s simple, concrete, and inspiring. It gave her team a clear goal to work towards, making it easier for everyone to know what they were trying to achieve. 🌟\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** An essential intent is a clear, inspiring, and measurable decision that simplifies future choices and focuses efforts."
