He also wrote *Living the 80/20 Way* (2004). \n\nWarren Buffett is quoted in Koch's *The 80/20 Individual*. \n\nMary Buffett and David Clark also shared insights from Warren Buffett in *The Tao of Warren Buffett: Warren Buffett’s Words of Wisdom* (2006). \n\nIn the blog post “The Unimportance of Practically Everything,” I had a conversation with someone at a meeting hosted by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle. He confirmed he believed in the idea I presented. \n\nJohn Maxwell discussed leadership in his book *Developing the Leader Within You* (1993).\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The concept of essentialism emphasizes the importance of focusing on what truly matters by recognizing the unimportance of practically everything else."
