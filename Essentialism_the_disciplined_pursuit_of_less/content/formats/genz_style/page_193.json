  "text": "**Nonessentialist vs. Essentialist**\n\n- **Mind is spinning out about the past or the future.**  \n- **Thinks about what was important yesterday or tomorrow.**  \n- **Worries about the future or stresses about the past.**  \n\n---\n\n- **Mind is focused on the present.**  \n- **Tunes in to what is important right now.**  \n- **Enjoys the moment.**  \n\n---\n\nRecently, Anna and I met for lunch during a hectic workday. Usually, we‚Äôre too busy catching up on our mornings or planning our evenings to actually enjoy lunch. But this time, Anna had an idea: let‚Äôs focus only on the moment. No rehashing meetings, no stressing about who‚Äôd pick up the kids from karate, and no dinner plans. We‚Äôd eat slowly and really be present. I was totally in.  \n\nAs I took my first bite, something clicked. I noticed my breathing. It started to slow down. Suddenly, time felt like it was moving slower. Instead of my body being here while my mind was scattered everywhere, I felt completely in the moment.  \n\nThis vibe stuck with me into the afternoon. I found I could concentrate fully on my work. Because I was calm and present, everything flowed naturally. Instead of my usual mental chaos, I was focused on what really mattered. Getting my work done became effortless and even brought me joy. What was good for my mind turned out to be good for my soul too.  \n\nJiro Ono is the world‚Äôs greatest sushi chef and the star of the movie *Jiro Dreams of Sushi*. At eighty-five, he‚Äôs a master of living in the moment. üç£\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialists focus on the present moment, allowing them to fully engage and find joy in their tasks, unlike nonessentialists who are distracted by past and future concerns."
