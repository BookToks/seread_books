  "text": "It’s true: doing less can be tough, both in art and life. Every word, scene, and activity has to matter. An editor is relentless in making each word count. Instead of two sentences, can you say it in one? Can one word replace two? As Alan D. Williams pointed out in “What Is an Editor?” there are two key questions for the author: Are you saying what you want to say? And, are you saying it clearly and concisely?\n\nCondensing means being as clear and brief as possible. In life, this also lets us do more with less. Take Graham Hill, who moved into a 420-square-foot apartment in New York. He wanted to see how much he could simplify his stuff. The result? A “little jewel box” design where every piece of furniture serves multiple purposes. For instance, one wall acts as a big projector screen for movies and hides two guest beds. Another wall folds down over the couch to reveal a queen bed. Everything pulls double or triple duty, making life in the apartment way more efficient. This idea was so clever that he turned it into a business called LifeEdited.com.\n\nBut remember, condensing doesn’t mean cramming more into one moment. It’s about reducing waste. It’s about having a better balance of words to ideas, square footage to usefulness, or effort to results. To really apply condensing in our lives, we need to shift from lots of meaningless activities to one meaningful one. For example, one employee I worked with skipped the weekly meeting and just asked others what he missed. He turned a two-hour meeting into ten minutes and spent the rest of that time getting actual work done.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Condensing in both editing and life involves eliminating waste to enhance clarity and meaning, allowing for greater contributions with less effort."
