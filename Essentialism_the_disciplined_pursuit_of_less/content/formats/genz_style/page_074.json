  "text": "**Get Out into the Field**\n\nJane Chen was part of a team in a class called “Design for Extreme Affordability.” Their mission? Design a baby incubator that costs just 1% of the usual $20,000. In the developing world, 4 million low-birthweight babies die within the first 28 days because they can’t keep their body temperature up. 😢\n\nIf they had just focused on cutting costs, they might have made a cheap electric incubator. That sounds good, but it wouldn’t have solved the real issue. Instead, they took the time to understand the problem. They traveled to Nepal to see the situation up close. That’s when they learned that 80% of babies were born at home, not in hospitals—and many rural areas had no electricity. \n\nSuddenly, the real challenge was clear: they needed to create something that didn’t need power at all. With this insight, they got serious about finding a solution. Jane and her teammates eventually launched a nonprofit called “Embrace” and created the “Embrace Nest.” This innovative incubator uses a wax-like substance heated in water, which can keep a baby warm for six hours or more.\n\nBy getting out there and really digging into the problem, they clarified what was essential and made a meaningful impact. 🌍✨\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** By immersing themselves in the real-world context of their challenge, Jane Chen and her team were able to identify the true needs and create an effective, electricity-free solution for low-birthweight infants."
