  "text": "In a class on nonprofits at Stanford Business School, we had to check out the vision and mission statements of different organizations. As we went through over a hundred examples, we noticed something surprising: some of the biggest, most ambitious statements were actually the least inspiring. \n\nTake one that aimed to “eliminate hunger in the world.” With only five people in the group, that mission felt more like empty words than a real goal. \n\nThen, out of all that vague idealism, came a statement that really hit home. It was from Brad Pitt, the actor and social entrepreneur. After seeing how slow the recovery was for New Orleans post-Hurricane Katrina, he created an organization called “Make It Right.” Their clear goal? “To build 150 affordable, green, storm-resistant homes for families in the Lower 9th Ward.” \n\nThat statement changed the vibe in the room. The specific target made it feel real. And that realness? It was inspiring. It answered the key question: “How will we know when we have succeeded?” 🌟\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Evaluating nonprofit mission statements revealed that specific, concrete goals, like Brad Pitt's \"Make It Right,\" are more inspiring than grandiose but vague ideals."
