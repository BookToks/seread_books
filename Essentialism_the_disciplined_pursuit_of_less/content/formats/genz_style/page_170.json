  "text": "is to get a draft of a fifteen-page report attached to an email and sent to the client by 2:00 P.M. on Thursday. This is a clear goal, not a vague one.\n\n2. IDENTIFY THE “SLOWEST HIKER”  \nBefore diving into the project, take a moment to think. Ask yourself, “What’s stopping me from getting this done?” Make a list of obstacles. These could include: missing info, low energy, or your need for perfection. Prioritize the list by asking, “What’s the one obstacle that, if I remove it, will clear up most of the others?”\n\nWhen figuring out your “slowest hiker,” remember that even productive tasks—like researching, emailing for info, or trying to perfect the report—can slow you down. The goal is to finish the draft. Anything getting in the way of that should be reconsidered.\n\nThere are usually multiple obstacles to achieving any important goal. But at any moment, there’s only one main priority. Removing random obstacles won’t help if the biggest one isn’t budging. For example, if your main issue is just getting words on the page, hiring someone to do research won’t help you write that report. Just like Alex fixes the least efficient machine first, we need to tackle obstacles one at a time.\n\n3. REMOVE THE OBSTACLE  \nLet’s say your “slowest hiker” is your desire to make the report perfect. You might have tons of ideas to improve it, but your main goal is to send off the draft. To overcome this, swap the thought “This has to be perfect” with “Done is better than perfect.” Give yourself permission to not have it polished in the first draft.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To achieve essential goals, identify and remove the primary obstacles that hinder progress."
