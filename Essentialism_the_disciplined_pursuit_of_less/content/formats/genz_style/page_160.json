  "text": "Projects and commitments always seem to take up all the time we give them. Think about how often this happens in presentations, meetings, or workshops. How many times have you seen someone try to cram too many slides into too little time? Or been at a conference where a presenter cut off a meaningful chat just to stick to their planned content? It happens so often, it feels normal.\n\nI once worked with a facilitator who had a refreshing approach. He was running a four-hour workshop but instead of the usual ten minutes for questions at the end, he suggested a full hour. He said, “I like to give a luxurious amount of time just in case things come up.” At first, people thought it was too much and wanted him to stick to the typical format. But guess what? The class ran over time, and he had to rush through the rest. So, they switched to his original plan. With that extra hour, they could handle unexpected discussions without stress, and the facilitator could focus on teaching instead of hurrying.\n\nA mom I know learned a similar lesson while getting ready for a family vacation. Usually, she’d leave packing until the night before, ending up tired, forgetting stuff, and leaving late. But this time, she started packing a week ahead. By the night before, the car was packed, so all she had to do in the morning was wake up the kids and load them up. It worked! They left early, got a good night’s sleep, remembered everything, and even handled traffic without a meltdown because they had a buffer. They arrived on time and had a smooth, enjoyable trip.\n\nNonessentialists often expect everything to go perfectly. We all know those people (and many of us have been them) who underestimate how long tasks will actually take: “This will just take five minutes,” or “I’ll be done with that in no time.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Projects and commitments often expand to fill the time allotted, leading to rushed outcomes unless a buffer is built in."
