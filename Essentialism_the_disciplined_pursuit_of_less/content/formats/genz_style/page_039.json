  "text": "How Do We Forget Our Ability to Choose?  \nOne key reason we forget we can choose comes from the classic research by Martin Seligman and Steve Maier. They discovered something called “learned helplessness” while experimenting with German shepherds. 🐶\n\nSeligman and Maier split the dogs into three groups. The first group wore a harness and got electric shocks, but they also had a lever they could press to stop the shocks. The second group was in a similar harness and got the same shocks, but here’s the catch: their lever didn’t work, so they were stuck feeling powerless. The third group? They just sat in the harness without any shocks at all.\n\nAfterward, all the dogs were put into a big box with a low divider in the middle. One side delivered shocks; the other didn’t. Here’s where it got interesting. The dogs that had either been able to stop the shocks or hadn’t been shocked at all quickly figured out how to jump over the divider to escape the shocks. \n\nThis shows how our past experiences can shape our ability to recognize our choices. If we feel powerless for too long, we might stop trying to change our situation. 🚫\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** We often forget our ability to choose due to experiences of learned helplessness, as demonstrated in experiments with dogs."
