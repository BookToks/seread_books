  "text": "**The Pause That Refreshes**\n\nJeffrey A. Rodgers, an executive at Cornish & Carey Commercial/Newmark Knight Frank, learned a simple yet powerful idea: pausing to refresh. It all started when he noticed that on his drive home, his mind was still stuck on work. We’ve all been there—leaving the office physically but still mentally trapped in the day’s endless loop of tasks and worries about tomorrow.\n\nNow, as he reaches his front door, he uses what he calls “the pause that refreshes.” It’s super simple. He stops for a moment, closes his eyes, and takes a deep, slow breath. As he exhales, he lets go of work stress. This helps him step into his home with a clear mind, ready to focus on his family. It echoes the wisdom of Lao Tzu: “In work, do what you enjoy. In family life, be completely present.” \n\nThich Nhat Hanh, a Vietnamese Zen monk known as the “world’s calmest man,” has dedicated his life to living in the moment (though he calls it something else). He teaches mindfulness or maintaining a “beginner’s mind.” He says, “Mindfulness helps you go home to the present. Every time you do, happiness comes.”\n\nThis focus on the now shapes everything he does. He takes a full hour each day to sip tea with other monks. He explains: “When you drink a cup of tea, breathe in and bring your mind back to your body. Be fully present. In that moment, you and the cup of tea are real. You’re not lost in the past or future. You’re free from worries, and you enjoy your tea. That’s the moment of happiness and peace.”\n\nLook for your own kairos moments throughout the day. Jot them down in your journal. Reflect on what triggered those moments and what pulled you away from them. Now that you know what sparks these experiences, you can embrace them more often. 🍵✨\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The concept of \"the pause that refreshes\" emphasizes the importance of taking a moment to clear one's mind of work-related thoughts to be fully present with family and in the moment."
