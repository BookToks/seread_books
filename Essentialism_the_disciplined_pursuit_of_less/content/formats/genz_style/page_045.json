  "text": "Getting used to \"less but better\" is tougher than it sounds. We've been taught to do more‚Äîalways more. But there comes a point when more effort just leads to a dead end. It feels right to think that effort equals results, but research shows it‚Äôs not that simple.\n\nSome experts argue that the link between effort and results is even less straightforward. They call it a ‚Äúpower law.‚Äù This means some efforts can give you way more results than others. For instance, Nathan Myhrvold, who used to be the chief tech officer at Microsoft, told me that top software developers can be up to 10,000 times more productive than the average ones. üò≤\n\nIt might sound extreme, but it drives home the point: some efforts lead to way better outcomes than others. The hard truth is that we live in a world where most things are pretty useless, and only a few are truly valuable. As John Maxwell put it, ‚ÄúYou cannot overestimate the unimportance of practically everything.‚Äù\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Certain efforts yield exponentially better results than others, highlighting the importance of focusing on what is truly valuable."
