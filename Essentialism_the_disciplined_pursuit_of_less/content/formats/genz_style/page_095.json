  "text": "**CHAPTER 9**  \n**SELECT**  \n**The Power of Extreme Criteria**  \n\nAn inner process needs some clear rules.  \n\nIn a talk called “No More Yes. It’s Either HELL YEAH! Or No,” TED speaker Derek Sivers shares a simple way to be more selective with our choices. The trick? Put decisions to the extreme test: if you feel super pumped to do something, then it’s a yes—Derek-style. Anything less? It’s a no. A leader at Twitter once told me, “If the answer isn’t a definite yes, then it should be a no.” That sums up a key Essentialist idea and is super important for exploration.  \n\nDerek lives by this rule. When he interviewed candidates for a job and wasn’t impressed, he said no to all of them. Eventually, he found the perfect fit. When he realized he had signed up for several conferences around the world that he wasn’t excited about, he decided to stay home and skipped them all. That gave him twelve days to focus on more productive stuff. When he was choosing where to live, he ruled out places that seemed okay (like Sydney and Vancouver) until he visited New York and instantly knew it was the right spot for him.  \n\nThink about what happens to our closets when we ask, “Is there a chance I’ll wear this someday?” They get cluttered with clothes we hardly touch. But if we ask, “Do I absolutely love this?” we can clear out the junk and make room for better things. We can apply this same thinking to other areas of our lives.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Using extreme criteria for decision-making helps prioritize what truly matters and eliminate unnecessary clutter in our lives."
