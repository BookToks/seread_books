Knight Journalism Fellowship at Stanford, focusing on media innovation and design thinking. I asked her for some insider tips on how to find the real story amid all the noise. Her response was uplifting: she believes you can learn how to spot the key info and lead in a story.\n\nMariam emphasizes the need for knowledge. To get to the heart of a story, you need a solid grasp of the topic, its context, how it fits into the bigger picture, and its connections to other fields. She dives into all related news to find that one crucial detail everyone else missed or overlooked.\n\n“My goal,” she shared, “was to understand the ‘spiderweb’ of the story. That’s how I could identify any ‘abnormal’ or ‘unusual’ details or behaviors that didn’t fit the usual narrative.”\n\nMariam stresses it’s important to look for “a different perspective on the story—something that sheds light in a fresh, thought-provoking way.” One technique she uses is role play: she imagines herself in the shoes of all the main players to better grasp their motives and viewpoints.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Mariam Semaan emphasizes that acquiring the skill to identify essential information in storytelling requires deep knowledge and a fresh perspective."
