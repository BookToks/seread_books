Even when we do take a moment, it’s easier to think in terms of adding stuff rather than cutting it out. Want to sell more products? Hire more salespeople. Want to boost output? Increase production. This approach has its merits, but there’s another way to improve results. \n\nInstead of adding efforts and resources, Essentialists focus on removing constraints or obstacles.
