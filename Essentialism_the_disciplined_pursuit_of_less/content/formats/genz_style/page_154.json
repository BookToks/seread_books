  "text": "**FIND YOUR DEALBREAKERS**  \nWhen I ask execs to pinpoint their boundaries, they often struggle. They know they have limits, but can’t express them. If you can’t clearly define your boundaries to yourself or others, don’t expect anyone else to respect them.  \n\nThink about one person who often derails your focus. Make a list of your dealbreakers—the requests or activities from that person that you refuse to accept unless they align with your priorities.  \n\nAnother quick way to find your dealbreakers is to jot down times when you feel pressured by someone’s request. It doesn’t have to be a huge deal; even a small “pinch” (a little violation of your boundaries) that sparks any resentment—like an unwanted invite or a random favor request—can reveal your hidden limits.  \n\n**CRAFT SOCIAL CONTRACTS**  \nI once teamed up with a colleague who had a totally different approach to projects. People thought we’d clash, but we actually vibed well. Why? Because I laid out my priorities and what extra work I could handle right from the start. I said, “Let’s agree on our goals. Here are a few things that matter to me…” Then, I asked him to share his priorities too.  \n\nWe created a “social contract,” similar to what Jin-Yung and her boss did in the opening story. By understanding our goals and boundaries upfront, we avoided wasting each other’s time, burdening each other with unnecessary requests, and distracting ourselves from what really mattered. This way, we both contributed our best to the project.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Identifying and articulating personal boundaries, or dealbreakers, is essential for maintaining focus on one's priorities and achieving effective collaboration."
