  "text": "TO FIGHT THIS FEAR, RUN A REVERSE PILOT\n\nOne trendy idea in business lately is “prototyping.” Basically, it’s about creating a model to test out a concept or product without going all-in financially. You can flip that concept around to cut out nonessentials in a low-risk way by doing what Daniel Shapero from LinkedIn calls a “reverse pilot.”\n\nIn a reverse pilot, you check if dropping a project or activity leads to any negative fallout. For instance, an executive I know took on a new senior role and inherited a big, flashy report that his predecessor had put a ton of effort into. It demanded a lot of his team's energy, and he suspected it wasn’t really benefiting the company much. So, he decided to run a reverse pilot. He stopped publishing the report and just waited to see the reaction. Turns out, no one missed it! After a few weeks, not a single person brought it up. He concluded that the report was unnecessary and could be cut.\n\nYou can do a similar reverse pilot in your social life. Are there commitments you always make to customers, colleagues, friends, or family that you think matter a lot to them, but they might hardly notice? By quietly cutting back or pausing an activity for a few days or weeks, you can see if it really makes a difference or if no one cares at all.\n\nEven with these techniques, “uncommitting” can be tougher than just not committing in the first place. It’s easy to feel guilty about saying no to something you’ve already agreed to, and let’s be real—no one likes to go back on their word. But learning how to do it—while earning respect for your courage, focus, and discipline—is key to becoming an Essentialist. 💪\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Running a reverse pilot allows individuals and organizations to test the impact of eliminating nonessential activities with minimal risk."
