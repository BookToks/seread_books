  "text": "3. DEAN FOODS CORPORATION  \nA food and drink company, especially known for milk, dairy, and soy products.  \nC. Their main goal? Maximize long-term shareholder value while following the laws where they operate and sticking to high ethical standards.  \n\nHow’d you do? If you were totally lost on this puzzle, you’re not alone. Those mission statements are so similar they make it tough to figure out. Vague and inflated statements might be seen as \"best practice\" in some circles, but they often fail to inspire employees with a clear sense of purpose.  \n\nThis part of the book is all about cutting out the nonessentials so we can focus on what really matters to us. The first thing to ditch? Any activity that doesn’t align with your goals. Sounds easy, right? But to pull it off, you need to be super clear about your purpose in the first place. That’s where this chapter steps in.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Vague mission statements fail to inspire employees and highlight the importance of clarity in defining purpose to eliminate nonessentials."
