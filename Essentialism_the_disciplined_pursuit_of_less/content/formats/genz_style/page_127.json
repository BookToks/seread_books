  "text": "**SAYING “NO” GRACEFULLY DOESN’T HAVE TO MEAN USING THE WORD “NO”**\n\nEssentialists say “no” more often than they actually use the word. Sometimes, the best way to decline is with a straightforward “no.” But you can also say things like, “I’m flattered you thought of me, but I don’t have the bandwidth,” or “I’d love to, but I’m overcommitted.” There are plenty of polite ways to refuse without saying the word “no.” (More examples of this are coming up later.)\n\n**FOCUS ON THE TRADE-OFF**\n\nThe more we think about what we give up when we say yes, the easier it is to say no. If we don’t understand the opportunity cost (what we’re losing out on), it’s easy to trick ourselves into thinking we can do it all. Spoiler: we can’t. A graceful “no” comes from knowing the trade-off clearly, even if we don’t say it out loud.\n\n**REMIND YOURSELF THAT EVERYONE IS SELLING SOMETHING**\n\nThis doesn’t mean you have to be skeptical of people. It just means everyone is pitching something—an idea, a perspective, or an opinion—in exchange for your time. Being aware of what’s being sold helps us decide if we want to buy into it.\n\n**MAKE YOUR PEACE WITH THE FACT THAT SAYING “NO” OFTEN REQUIRES TRADING POPULARITY FOR RESPECT**\n\nWhen you say no, it can temporarily affect your relationship. If someone asks for something and you decline, their initial reaction might be annoyance or disappointment. But remember, setting boundaries shows that you value your time. 💪\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialists often say \"no\" gracefully by recognizing the trade-offs involved and understanding that everyone is seeking to exchange something for their time."
