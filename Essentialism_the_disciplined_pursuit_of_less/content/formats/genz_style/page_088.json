  "text": "I used to pull one all-nighter a week. Not great. Then my wife handed me an article that flipped my view on sleep. It argued that sleep isn’t the enemy of productivity—it’s actually a key player in peak performance. The article mentioned top business leaders who proudly get a full eight hours. Bill Clinton even said every major mistake he made was due to lack of sleep. Since then, I’ve aimed for eight hours every night. \n\nWhat about you? Think back on the last week. Did you sleep less than seven hours on any night? Or maybe a few nights in a row? Have you ever thought, “Not me. I can totally survive on four or five hours”? (If that crossed your mind while reading, this chapter is for you.) Sure, some people can get by on less sleep, but most of them are just so used to being tired that they forget what being fully rested feels like. \n\nNonessentialists see sleep as just another burden in their chaotic, busy lives. Essentialists view sleep as crucial for performing at their best. That’s why they intentionally schedule sleep into their lives. By “protecting their asset” (that’s you!), they have energy, creativity, and problem-solving skills ready when needed. Nonessentialists, on the other hand, never know when fatigue will hit them.\n\nEssentialists choose to skip one thing now so they can do more tomorrow. It’s a trade-off, but over time, that small choice can lead to big gains. \n\n**Nonessentialist**  \nTHINKS: One hour less of sleep equals  \n\n**Essentialist**  \nKNOWS: One hour more of sleep equals several hours of higher productivity. 💤\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialists view sleep as essential for high performance and productivity, while Nonessentialists see it as a burden."
