  "text": "Kelleher was super clear about what Southwest Airlines was: a low-cost airline. He knew what they weren’t too. His choices reflected that. He said, “You have to look at every opportunity and say, ‘Nope, we’re not doing a thousand different things that won’t help us reach our goal.’” \n\nAt first, critics slammed Southwest. They couldn't believe this approach would work. Who would want to fly an airline that only went to certain places and didn’t serve meals, no matter how cheap the tickets? But after a few years, it was obvious Southwest was onto something big. Their profits soared, and competitors started to take notes.\n\nInstead of fully embracing Kelleher’s Essentialist approach, other airlines tried to “straddle” their strategies, a term coined by Harvard professor Michael Porter. Straddling means keeping your current strategy while also trying to copy a competitor’s. Continental Airlines gave it a shot with their new service called Continental Lite.\n\nContinental Lite borrowed some of Southwest’s ideas. They cut fares, ditched meals, and got rid of first-class service. They even increased flight frequency. But here’s the catch: since they clung to their old business model (Continental Lite was just a small part of their flights), they couldn’t compete on price effectively. This forced them to cut corners elsewhere, which hurt their service quality.\n\nWhile Southwest made smart, deliberate trade-offs in key areas, Continental sacrificed things that didn’t fit into a clear strategy. Porter points out, “A strategic position isn’t sustainable without trade-offs.” By trying to juggle two conflicting strategies, Continental ended up hurting their competitiveness. The straddling strategy was a costly mistake for them. 💸\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Southwest Airlines succeeded by making deliberate trade-offs in their strategy, while competitors like Continental Airlines struggled by trying to adopt conflicting approaches."
