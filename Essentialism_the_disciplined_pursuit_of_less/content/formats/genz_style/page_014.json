  "text": "**The Way of the Nonessentialist**\n\nOne sunny winter day in California, I visited my wife, Anna, in the hospital. She looked amazing, but I could tell she was wiped out. Our baby girl had just been born—healthy and happy at 7 pounds, 3 ounces. 🎉\n\nWhat should’ve been one of the happiest days of my life was actually super tense. Even with our beautiful baby in Anna’s tired arms, I was glued to my phone and email, feeling the heat to make it to a client meeting. A colleague had joked, “Friday between 1–2 would be a bad time to have a baby because I need you at this meeting.” Well, it was Friday, and even though I hoped it was a joke, I still felt the pressure to show up.\n\nI knew what I should do. It was clearly a time to be with my wife and newborn. So when asked if I’d attend the meeting, I said with all the confidence I could muster, “Yes.”\n\nTo my regret, while my wife was in the hospital with our hours-old baby, I went to that meeting. Afterward, my colleague said, “The client will respect you for being here.” But the looks on the clients’ faces didn’t show respect. They mirrored my own feelings: confusion and regret.\n\nWhat was I doing there? I had said “yes” just to keep everyone happy, but in doing so, I hurt my family, my integrity, and even the client relationship. \n\nAs it turned out, nothing came from that meeting. Even if it had, I would’ve made a foolish trade. By trying to please everyone, I sacrificed what truly mattered.\n\nHere’s the takeaway: If you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will. ✌️\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** If you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will."
