  "text": "**From “Pretty Clear” to “Really Clear”**\n\nExecutives I work with often say their company purpose or strategy is “pretty clear,” like that’s good enough. But anyone with glasses knows there’s a huge gap between pretty clear and really clear! The same goes for people’s career goals. When I ask, “What do you really want from your career in the next five years?” I’m shocked by how many can’t answer. 🤔\n\nThis matters because knowing your purpose is a big predictor of how well people perform at work. I’ve seen it firsthand with executive teams. When they’re only “sort of clear” about their goals, it leads to issues. \n\nFor starters, motivation and teamwork take a hit without a clear purpose. You can train leaders on communication and teamwork all day, but if the team lacks clarity on their goals and roles, problems will just grow. \n\nThis isn’t just my opinion or something I read in another business book. I’ve gathered data from over five hundred people across more than a thousand teams, and the results are clear: when teams lack clarity about their purpose and roles, people feel confused, stressed, and frustrated. But when clarity is high, people thrive. 🌟\n\nWithout clarity, folks waste time and energy on the trivial stuff. With enough clarity, they can achieve breakthroughs and innovations that are way beyond what they thought possible in the areas that truly matter. In my experience, I’ve noticed two common patterns that pop up when teams don’t have a clear purpose. \n\n**PATTERN 1: PLAYING POLITICS**\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Clarity of purpose significantly enhances motivation and cooperation within teams, while a lack of it leads to confusion and inefficiency."
