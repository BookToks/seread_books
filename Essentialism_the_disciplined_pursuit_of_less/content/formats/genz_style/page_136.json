  "text": "**PRETEND YOU DON’T OWN IT YET**  \nTom Stafford has a simple fix for the endowment effect. Instead of asking, “How much do I value this?” flip it: “If I didn’t own this, how much would I pay for it?” You can do this for opportunities too. Don’t think, “How will I feel if I miss out?” Instead, ask, “If I didn’t have this chance, what would I give up to get it?” The same goes for projects: “If I wasn’t already involved, how hard would I work to join?”\n\n**GET OVER THE FEAR OF WASTE**  \nHal Arkes, a psychology professor, wonders why adults fall for the sunk-cost bias more than kids do. He thinks it’s because we’ve been trained our whole lives with the “Don’t waste” rule. By adulthood, we’re conditioned to avoid looking wasteful—even to ourselves. \n\n“Quitting a project you’ve invested in feels like wasting everything, and that’s a big no-no,” Arkes explains. \n\nTo illustrate, he shares this scenario: Imagine you spent $100 on a ski trip ticket to Michigan. Later, you buy a $50 ticket for a trip to Wisconsin, which you think will be way more fun. But then you realize both trips are on the same weekend, and you can’t return either ticket. When asked which trip you’d choose, over half picked the more expensive Michigan trip, even though they’d enjoy Wisconsin more. Their flawed logic? They thought using the cheaper ticket would mean wasting more money. It’s easy to cling to what we’ve already sunk costs into, but doing so just leads to more waste.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To counter the endowment effect, we should evaluate items and opportunities as if we do not own them, focusing on their true value rather than our attachment."
