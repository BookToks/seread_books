  "text": "### Of Work and Play\n\nSome forward-thinking companies are finally realizing how important play is. Twitter's CEO, Dick Costolo, is all about play through comedy. He even started an improv class at work. As a former stand-up comic, he knows that improv gets people to think outside the box and be more creative. \n\nOther companies get playful by changing up their workspaces. IDEO holds meetings in a Microbus. At Google, you might find a giant dinosaur decked out in pink flamingos. Pixar artists have ‚Äúoffices‚Äù that look like everything from a wild west saloon to a wooden hut filled with thousands of Star Wars figurines (seriously, it‚Äôs wild!).\n\nI once knew a successful woman at a publishing company who kept an Easy Button‚Ñ¢ from Staples on her desk. Whenever someone left her office, they‚Äôd get a kick out of slamming it, and a voice would blare, ‚ÄúThat was easy!‚Äù Another woman down the hall had a framed poster of a children‚Äôs book illustration to remind her of the joy of reading as a kid.\n\nDesk toys, flamingo-covered dinosaurs, and offices stuffed with action figures might seem silly to some, but they actually serve a purpose. They push back against the idea that play is pointless. Instead, these fun touches highlight that play is crucial for creativity and exploration. \n\nPlay isn‚Äôt just a way to find what matters; it‚Äôs essential on its own. üéâ\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Innovative companies recognize the essential value of play as a vital driver of creativity and exploration."
