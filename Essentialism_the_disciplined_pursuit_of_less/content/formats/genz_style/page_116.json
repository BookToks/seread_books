  "text": "**Essential Intent**\n\nTo get what an essential intent is, let’s first figure out what it’s not. \n\nWe can break this down using a simple two-by-two matrix (think of it as a chart). \n\nIn the top left corner, we find vision and mission statements, like “We want to change the world.” They sound cool but are so vague that people often ignore them. \n\nIn the bottom left corner, we see generic values—think “innovation,” “leadership,” and “teamwork.” These are usually too bland to spark any real enthusiasm. 🌱\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** An essential intent is a clear and measurable goal that guides decisions and actions, distinguishing it from vague mission statements and general values."
