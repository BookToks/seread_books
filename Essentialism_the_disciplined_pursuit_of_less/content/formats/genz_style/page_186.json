  "text": "### The Power of the Right Routine\n\nResearch from Duke University shows that almost 40% of our choices happen without us even realizing it. ðŸ˜³ This can be both good and bad. The good? We can build new skills that become second nature. The bad? We might fall into routines that actually hurt us. \n\nWithout even noticing, we can get stuck in unhelpful habitsâ€”like checking our emails the moment we wake up, grabbing a doughnut on our way home, or wasting our lunch scrolling online instead of recharging or connecting with friends. So, how do we ditch the routines that trap us in these nonessential habits and swap them for ones that make focusing on what matters easier?\n\n### OVERHAUL YOUR TRIGGERS\n\nMost of us have a habit we want to change. Maybe itâ€™s eating less junk, wasting less time, or stressing out less. But when we try, even the smallest changes can feel impossible. Itâ€™s like thereâ€™s a gravitational pull dragging us back to those fries, that cat meme site, or spiraling into worry. How can we fight against these strong habits?\n\nIn an interview about his book *The Power of Habit*, Charles Duhigg explained that every habit consists of three parts: a cue, a routine, and a reward. The cue is what triggers your brain to go into automatic mode and pick a habit. Then comes the routineâ€”the actual behavior, whether itâ€™s physical, mental, or emotional. Finally, thereâ€™s the reward, which helps your brain decide if that habit is worth keeping. Over time, this loopâ€”cue, routine, rewardâ€”becomes automatic as the cue and reward get wired together in your brain. ðŸ§ \n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Our unconscious choices can lead to both unproductive routines and the opportunity to develop new, instinctive abilities."
