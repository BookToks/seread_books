  "text": "**Living with Intent**\n\nEssential intent is about more than just your job or your companyâ€™s mission. It's all about finding your true purpose and guiding your lifeâ€™s journey. Take Nelson Mandela, for example. He spent twenty-seven years in prison, but instead of letting it break him, he became an Essentialist. When he was jailed in 1962, he lost almost everything: his home, reputation, pride, and freedom. But he used that time to focus on what really mattered and let go of everything else, even his resentment. His essential intent? To end apartheid in South Africa. That mission created a legacy that still resonates today. \n\nCreating your own essential intent isnâ€™t easy. It takes guts, insight, and the ability to see what really counts. You have to ask tough questions, make hard choices, and be disciplined enough to cut out distractions that pull you away from your true goals. But itâ€™s worth it. When you have clear purpose, you and your team can really come together to achieve something amazing. ðŸŒŸ\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essential intent is a guiding principle that helps individuals focus on their true purpose and eliminate distractions to achieve excellence."
