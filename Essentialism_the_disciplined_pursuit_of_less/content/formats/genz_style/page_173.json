  "text": "Think about the last time you got pulled over by the cops. Did you wonder if it would be a good ticket or a bad one? Probably not—tickets are usually bad news. But one police department in Richmond, Canada, decided to flip that script.\n\nThey came up with a cool idea: instead of just giving tickets for bad behavior, they started handing out “Positive Tickets” for good actions. Simple stuff, like throwing trash in the bin, wearing a helmet while biking, skateboarding in the right spots, or just getting to school on time. These tickets didn’t come with a fine like a parking ticket; instead, they could be traded for small rewards, like free movie passes or entry to local youth events. This kept young people engaged and out of trouble.\n\nSo, how did this unique approach to policing work out? Surprisingly well! It took some time, but they committed to this long-term strategy. After ten years, the Positive Tickets system slashed repeat offenses from 60% down to 8%. 🙌\n\nYou might not picture a police department as a place for Essentialism (the idea of focusing on what truly matters), but this system shows how powerful it can be. Nonessentialists tend to go big on everything, trying to do it all at once. They think the more they hustle, the more they’ll achieve. But here’s the catch: the harder you reach for the stars, the harder it is to get off the ground.\n\nEssentialists, on the other hand, take a different route. They start small and celebrate every bit of progress. Instead of chasing flashy wins that don’t really matter, they focus on those small, meaningful victories in areas that count.\n\n**Nonessentialist vs. Essentialist:**\n\n- **Nonessentialist:** Starts with a big goal, gets small results, goes for flashy wins.\n- **Essentialist:** Starts small, gets big results, celebrates small acts of progress.\n\nBy rewarding people for those “small wins,” this system shows how tiny steps can lead to major changes. 🌟\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Richmond's Positive Tickets system effectively reduced recidivism by celebrating small acts of positive behavior rather than focusing solely on punitive measures."
