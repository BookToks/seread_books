  "text": "### ESSENCE  \n**What’s the Core Logic of an Essentialist?**  \n\nEssentialism isn’t just about adding more to your plate; it’s about flipping how you approach everything. It’s a mindset. But getting this mindset isn’t easy. We’re constantly pulled towards Nonessentialism—think of it as the “do it all” trap.  \n\nThis section has three chapters. Each one tackles a myth of Nonessentialism and swaps it for an Essentialist truth.  \n\nTo truly live like an Essentialist, we need to challenge three common beliefs: “I have to,” “It’s all important,” and “I can do both.” These ideas are like sirens—tempting but dangerous. They pull us in and drown us in distractions.  \n\nInstead, we should embrace three key truths: “I choose to,” “Only a few things really matter,” and “I can do anything but not everything.” These truths wake us up from our Nonessentialist haze. They set us free to focus on what truly counts and let us contribute at our best.  \n\nAs we shed the baggage of Nonessentialism and adopt the core logic of Essentialism, living this way becomes second nature. 🌱\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialism is a transformative way of thinking that challenges nonessential assumptions to focus on what truly matters in life."
