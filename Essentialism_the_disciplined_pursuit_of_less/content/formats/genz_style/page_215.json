  "text": "**TALENT**\n\n**Nonessentialist**  \nThey hire people in a panic, leading to a “Bozo explosion” (a team that goes downhill fast). \n\n**Essentialist**  \nThey’re super picky about who joins the team and don’t hesitate to let go of those who drag everyone down.\n\n---\n\n**RESULT**  \n**Nonessentialist**  \nA scattered team that barely moves forward in a million directions.  \n\n**Essentialist**  \nA cohesive team that levels up its contributions.\n\n---\n\nFrom this comparison, it’s clear that using the Essentialist approach in leadership is a game changer. Let’s break down how to lead like an Essentialist.\n\n---\n\n**BE RIDICULOUSLY SELECTIVE IN HIRING PEOPLE**  \nNonessentialists rush to hire anyone, often getting too busy to fire or retrain those who aren’t cutting it. At first, it feels justified due to growth demands. But one bad hire can cost way more than being short-staffed. Plus, one wrong hire often leads to more bad hires because they attract similar talent. Guy Kawasaki called this a “Bozo explosion”—when a great team slips into mediocrity. \n\nOn the flip side, Essentialists are extremely selective. They wait for the right hire, no matter how many résumés they sift through or interviews they conduct. They won’t hesitate to cut loose anyone who holds the team back. The result? A team of all-stars whose combined efforts create something greater than the sum of their parts. 🌟\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The Essentialist approach to leadership emphasizes being highly selective in hiring to build a unified team of top performers, contrasting with the Nonessentialist tendency to hire impulsively, leading to mediocrity."
