  "text": "**CHAPTER 19  \nFOCUS  \nWhat’s Important Now?**\n\nLife only happens in the present moment. If you miss out on now, you can’t really enjoy your daily life. —Thich Nhat Hanh\n\nLarry Gelwix coached the Highland High School rugby team to an insane record: 418 wins, just 10 losses, and 20 national championships over 36 years. He confidently says, “We always win.” With stats like that, he’s earned the right. But he’s talking about more than just winning; he focuses on one key question that drives his players: “What’s important now?” \n\nBy keeping his players present and focused on what matters most—not stressing about next week’s match, tomorrow’s practice, or the next play—Larry makes winning feel almost effortless. But how does he do it?\n\nFirst, the players ask themselves that question constantly during the game. Instead of dwelling on a mistake from the last play or worrying about losing, Larry gets them to focus only on the play they’re in right now. \n\nSecond, the question “What’s important now?” keeps them locked in on their own performance. Larry believes winning comes down to whether players focus on their game or get distracted by the other team. If they start thinking about their opponents, they lose their edge.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Larry Gelwix emphasizes the importance of staying present and focused on the question \"What’s important now?\" to achieve success in rugby."
