  "text": "Clay didn’t get fired for sticking to his guns. It wasn’t the popular choice, but he earned respect for it. Those boundaries? They really paid off.\n\nClay remembers: “That taught me a key lesson. If I had made one exception, I might have ended up making many.”\n\nBoundaries are like the walls of a sandcastle. Once one crumbles, the rest can follow. \n\nSetting boundaries is tough. Just because it worked for Jin-Yung and Clay doesn’t mean it always will. Jin-Yung could’ve lost her job offer. Clay’s refusal to work weekends could have hurt his career. Boundaries can come with a hefty price.\n\nBut not pushing back costs even more: it robs us of our ability to choose what truly matters in life. For Jin-Yung and Clay, respect at work and time for God and family were non-negotiable. They made those priorities clear. If you don’t set boundaries, they won’t exist. Or worse, someone else will set them for you—by default, not design.\n\nNonessentialists see boundaries as limits that cramp their style. They think needing boundaries means you’re weak. They believe they can handle everything. But without limits, they end up stretched too thin, making it impossible to get anything done.\n\nEssentialists, however, view boundaries as empowering. They know boundaries guard their time from being taken over and help them avoid saying no to things that only benefit others. Clear boundaries let them ditch distractions and focus on what really matters.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Setting boundaries is essential for prioritizing what truly matters in life and work."
