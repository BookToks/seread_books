  "text": "### An Idea Whose Time Has Come\n\nAs Victor Hugo once said, ‚ÄúNothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come.‚Äù The principle of ‚Äúless but better‚Äù is definitely here to stay. \n\nWhen we give ourselves the green light to be picky about what we do, everything shifts. We unlock new levels of achievement in our lives. There‚Äôs real freedom in realizing we can cut out the nonessentials. We stop being controlled by other people's agendas and start making our own choices. With this newfound power, we can find our highest contribution‚Äînot just to our own lives and careers, but to the world.\n\nImagine if schools ditched busywork and focused on projects that actually mattered to the community. What if students had time to think about their biggest contributions for the future, so when they graduated, they weren‚Äôt just racing toward nowhere?\n\nWhat if businesses got rid of pointless meetings and created space for people to work on what really matters? What if employees pushed back against time-wasting emails and useless projects so they could shine in their roles?\n\nWhat if society stopped pushing us to buy more stuff and instead encouraged us to create space to breathe and think? What if we rejected the pressure to do things we hate, buy things we don‚Äôt need, and impress people we don‚Äôt even like?\n\nWhat if we stopped being sold on the idea that having more is better and started valuing having less? \n\nWhat if we stopped celebrating busyness as a sign of importance? Instead, let‚Äôs celebrate the time we spend listening, reflecting, meditating, and enjoying moments with the people who matter most.\n\nWhat if the whole world shifted from chasing more to pursuing less‚Ä¶ but better? üåç‚ú®\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The principle of \"less but better\" empowers individuals to eliminate nonessentials and focus on their highest contributions, leading to greater freedom and achievement."
