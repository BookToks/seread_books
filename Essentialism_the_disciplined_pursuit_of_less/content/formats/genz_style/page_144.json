  "text": "**Editing Life**  \n**CUT OUT OPTIONS**  \nLet’s be real: editing means cutting out stuff that confuses readers and messes with the message or story. Well-edited movies and books are just easier to digest.  \n\nWhen it comes to making decisions, cutting options can feel super scary. But here’s the truth: it’s the core of decision-making.  \n\nFun fact: the Latin root of \"decision\"—cis or cid—literally means \"to cut\" or \"to kill.\" You can see this in words like scissors, homicide, or fratricide. Fewer options actually make decisions easier to handle. So, we need to toughen up and ditch options or activities that might be good (or even really good) but just get in the way.  \n\nSure, choosing to eliminate something good can sting. But in the end, every cut brings joy—maybe not right away, but later, when we realize we have more time for better things. That’s probably why Stephen King said, \"To write is human, to edit is divine.\"  \n\n**CONDENSE**  \nA lot of people have said it best: “I must apologize; if I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Editing involves cutting out confusing elements to clarify the message, making decision-making easier and ultimately more rewarding."
