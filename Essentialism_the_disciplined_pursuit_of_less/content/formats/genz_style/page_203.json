In this chapter, it’s time to take that leap and learn how to use those skills to not just practice Essentialism occasionally, but to **become** a true Essentialist.\n\n### MAJORING IN MINOR ACTIVITIES\n\nThere’s a big difference between being a Nonessentialist who sometimes uses Essentialist practices and being an Essentialist who occasionally slips into Nonessentialist habits.
