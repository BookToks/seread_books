  "text": "**ADMIT FAILURE TO BEGIN SUCCESS**  \nI had this friend who never asked for directions. He just couldn’t admit he was lost. So, we’d end up driving in circles, wasting time and energy—total nonessential activity. 🚗💨  \nOnly when we own up to our mistakes can we move on. Denying a mistake just keeps us stuck in that pointless loop. No shame in admitting you messed up; it just means you’re wiser now.  \n\n**STOP TRYING TO FORCE A FIT**  \nIn the movie *Tootsie*, Dustin Hoffman plays an actor who keeps failing auditions. One moment, he’s told he needs to be older, then younger, then shorter. Desperate, he insists, “I can be shorter!” But the exec says, “We need someone different.”  \nWe often act like Hoffman’s character, trying too hard to be something we’re not. Whether in life or work, it’s easy to force a bad fit.  \n\n**GET A NEUTRAL SECOND OPINION**  \nWhen we’re too emotionally invested in forcing something that doesn’t work, it helps to get an outside perspective. A neutral friend can give us the nudge we need to stop pushing something that clearly isn’t happening.  \nI once wasted months trying to make a project work that just wasn’t meant to be.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Admitting failure allows us to move forward and avoid wasting time on mismatched commitments."
