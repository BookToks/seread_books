  "text": "**Avoiding Commitment Traps**\n\n**WATCH OUT FOR THE ENDOWMENT EFFECT**  \nOwning something can mess with your head. Ever heard the saying, “Nobody in the history of the world has washed their rental car”? That’s because of the endowment effect. It’s our habit to undervalue stuff we don’t own and overvalue what we do.\n\nTake a study by Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman. He gave coffee mugs to half the participants in an experiment. One group was asked how much they’d sell their mug for, while the other group was asked how much they’d pay for one. The mug owners wanted at least $5.25 to sell theirs, but those without mugs were only willing to pay $2.25 to $2.75. Just owning the mug made them think it was worth way more.\n\nThink about your own stuff. Can you remember a time when giving something away suddenly made it seem super valuable? Maybe it’s that book you haven’t read in years, a kitchen gadget still in the box, or that sweater from Aunt Mildred that’s never seen the light of day. Even if you don’t use them, the fact that they’re yours makes you value them more than if they weren’t.\n\nThis bias doesn’t just apply to our belongings; it also creeps into our commitments. That stalled project at work feels way more important when you’re the one in charge. Or that bake sale you organized? It’s tough to back out when you’ve put it all together. When we feel like we “own” an activity, it’s harder to let go.\n\nBut here’s a helpful tip:\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The endowment effect leads us to overvalue what we own, making it difficult to let go of nonessential commitments and possessions."
