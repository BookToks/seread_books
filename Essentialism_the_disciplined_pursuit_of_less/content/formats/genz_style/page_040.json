  "text": "The dogs in the study faced some serious shocks. Those that had been shocked before didn’t even try to escape the pain. Why? They didn’t know they had a choice. They had learned to feel helpless. \n\nHumans can fall into this same trap. Take a kid who struggles with math. No matter how hard he tries, he doesn’t improve, so he gives up. He thinks nothing he does will change anything.\n\nI’ve seen learned helplessness in many workplaces. When people feel their efforts don’t matter, they usually react in one of two ways. Some check out completely, just like that frustrated kid. Others go the opposite route. They become super active, saying yes to every task and challenge. At first, this looks like dedication. But dig deeper, and you see it’s a cover-up. These folks don’t believe they can choose which projects to take on. They feel like they “have to do it all.”\n\nI get it—making choices can be tough. Saying no often feels like a loss. Outside of work, it gets even trickier. Walk into a store, and everything is designed to pressure you into buying. Political ads? They aim to make it seem impossible to consider the other side. And when family asks for favors, it can feel like there’s no real choice at all. With all this pressure, it’s no wonder we forget we can choose.\n\nBut choice is the heart of being an Essentialist. To embrace this mindset, we need to be aware of our power to choose. It’s a strength that exists within us, separate from everything else around us. 💪\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Humans can learn helplessness when they believe their efforts do not matter, leading to a loss of the ability to choose."
