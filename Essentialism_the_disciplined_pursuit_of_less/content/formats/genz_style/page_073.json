  "text": "**Keep a Journal**\n\nLet’s get real: the words \"journal\" and \"journalist\" come from the same root. A journalist literally writes a journal. So, one of the best ways to be the journalist of your own life is to keep a journal. \n\nHere’s the kicker: we humans forget a lot. Like, shockingly so. Don’t believe it? Try to remember what you had for dinner two Thursdays ago. Or think about the meetings you attended three Mondays back. If you’re like most people, you’ll hit a total blank. A journal is like a backup for your brain’s faulty hard drive. As someone once told me, “the faintest pencil is better than the strongest memory.” 📝\n\nFor the last ten years, I’ve kept a journal using a surprisingly effective trick: I write less than I think I should. Most people start journaling by writing pages on day one. Then, on day two, the thought of writing so much feels overwhelming, and they either procrastinate or quit. So, stick to the “less but better” principle. Don’t write more until daily journaling becomes a habit.\n\nAlso, every ninety days or so, take an hour to read your past entries. But don’t sweat the small stuff, like that budget meeting from three weeks ago or last Thursday’s pasta dinner. Focus on the bigger picture—look for patterns or trends. Capture the headlines of your days, weeks, and life. Those small changes might not seem like much at first, but over time, they can lead to big results. 🌟\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Keeping a journal helps us remember important aspects of our lives and identify broader patterns over time."
