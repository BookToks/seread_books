  "text": "**Chapter 9: Select**\n\n**DEBATE UNTIL YOU HAVE A CLEAR ESSENTIAL INTENT**  \nIf you don’t know your purpose, Nonessentialist leaders end up juggling too many goals and trying to do everything. This spreads their teams thin, making barely any progress. They waste time on stuff that doesn’t matter and ignore what really counts (check out Chapter 10 for more on purpose and essential intent). These days, everyone talks about “alignment,” and it’s true—when a team is aligned, they contribute way more. Clear intent leads to alignment; vague direction? Total misalignment every time.\n\n**GO FOR EXTREME EMPOWERMENT**  \nNonessentialists hold people back by being unclear about who’s doing what. They think it makes them flexible or agile, but it’s just fake agility. When people don’t know their responsibilities or how they’ll be judged, and when decisions seem random, they either give up or waste time trying to look busy instead of actually getting stuff done. \n\nAn Essentialist knows clarity is the key to empowerment. They don’t let roles get fuzzy. Everyone on the team needs to know exactly what they’re supposed to contribute and what others are doing too. One CEO admitted that his team’s confusion was holding the whole organization back. To fix it, he streamlined everything until he had just four direct reports, each with a clear role across the organization. \n\nPeter Thiel, the bold entrepreneur and venture capitalist, took the idea of “less but better” to a whole new level at PayPal.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Nonessentialist leaders create misalignment and hinder progress by pursuing too many objectives, while Essentialist leaders foster clarity and empowerment to enhance team contribution."
