  "text": "People who really embrace Essentialism get way more out of their efforts than those who just skim the surface. The perks stack up. Every time we choose to focus on what truly matters and ditch the fluff, it becomes easier to do next time. Eventually, it’s like second nature. Over time, that core focus grows and takes over, pushing aside the distractions.\n\nIt’s super easy to fall into the \"paradox of success\" we talked about earlier. We start off clear about our goals, which leads to wins. But then, success brings more options and opportunities. Sounds great, right? But these new choices can pull us off track, distract us, and spread us too thin. Instead of using our energy for what counts, we end up scattered.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Embracing Essentialism leads to greater cumulative benefits and a clearer focus on meaningful accomplishments by eliminating the nonessential."
