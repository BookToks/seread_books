  "text": "Ray Zinn is the founder and CEO of Micrel, a semiconductor company in Silicon Valley. He’s not your typical tech guy. At seventy-five, he stands out in an industry that usually praises twenty-something college dropouts. Back in 1978, he and his partner put in $300,000 to start the company, and it’s been profitable every year since—except one year when they combined two manufacturing facilities. Their stock price has never dipped below its IPO price. Ray attributes this success to a strict focus on profitability.\n\nAs CEO for thirty-five years, Ray sticks to a super consistent routine. He wakes up at 5:30 A.M. every day, even on weekends (he’s been doing this for over fifty years). He exercises for an hour, eats breakfast at 7:30 A.M., and gets to work by 8:15 A.M. Dinner with his family is at 6:30 P.M., and he’s in bed by 10:00 P.M. \n\nWhat really helps Ray perform at his best is his simple rule: “Focus on the hardest thing first.” He believes we already have too much to think about, so why not simplify things with a routine? \n\nTry using this tip to tackle your hardest task first thing in the morning. Find a cue—like that first glass of orange juice at your desk, an alarm on your phone, or anything you usually do when you wake up—to remind you to sit down and focus on that tough task.\n\n**Mix Up Your Routines**  \nDoing the same things at the same time every day can get boring. To keep things fresh, switch up your routines for different days. Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter and founder of Square, has a unique approach. He themes his week: Monday is for management and running the company, Tuesday is for product development, Wednesday is for marketing and growth, Thursday is for developers and partnerships, and Friday is all about company culture. 🌟\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Ray Zinn attributes his company's long-term profitability and success to a disciplined routine that prioritizes focusing on the hardest tasks first."
