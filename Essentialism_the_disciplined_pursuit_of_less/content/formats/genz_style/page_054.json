Now, his work has reached millions, even with just three full-time employees. \n\nTrade-offs can sting, but they open up huge opportunities. They push us to weigh our options and pick the best one, boosting our chances of getting what we want. Just like Southwest Airlines, we can thrive by making consistent choices.\n\nI saw this in action on a flight to Boston. I chatted with two parents visiting their son at Harvard. They were super proud and shared how they helped him get accepted. They tried out different activities with him, but if one didn’t seem like it would be his “big thing,” they talked it over and moved on. It’s not about every parent wanting their kid at Harvard; it’s about these Essentialist parents knowing their goal and making smart trade-offs to get there.\n\nThis idea applies to our personal lives too. When Anna and I were newlyweds, we met a couple with what seemed like an amazing marriage. We asked their secret. They told us they decided not to join any clubs. No local lodge, no book clubs. They weren’t uninterested; they just chose to spend that time with their kids. Over the years, their kids became their best friends—totally worth skipping out on golf buddies or book discussions.\n\nEssentialists see trade-offs as part of life, not a negative. Instead of asking, “What do I have to give up?” they ask, “What do I want to go big on?” This shift in thinking can have a huge impact.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialists view trade-offs as opportunities for strategic decision-making to achieve their desired outcomes."
