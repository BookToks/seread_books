  "text": "I want everyone to have the guts to live life on their own terms, not just what others expect. Imagine kids, parents, workers, and leaders all tapping into their true potential to create lives that matter. I see a movement starting—a conversation that inspires change.\n\nTo find the courage to follow the right path, we need to think about how short life is and what we really want to achieve with our time. As poet Mary Oliver said, “Tell me, what is it you plan to do / with your one wild and precious life?” 🦋\n\nI challenge you to pause and really ask yourself that. Make a commitment to prioritize what truly matters. Do you honestly think you’ll regret that choice? Will you wake up one day wishing you had done less of what felt right for you and more of what others expected? \n\nLet’s create a system that favors the essential over the trivial. I challenge you to become more of an Essentialist. This book isn’t about going back to simpler times or disconnecting from the digital world. That’s not progress. It’s about applying the “less but better” mindset to our lives today and moving forward. That’s true innovation. 🚀\n\nSo, be smarter than I was when my daughter was born. I truly believe good things will come from this choice. Just think about the impact if everyone dropped one nonessential activity and replaced it with something that really matters.\n\nYears from now, when you look back on your life, you might have some regrets. But choosing the Essentialist path probably won’t be one of them. What would you give to be back here now with the chance to be true to yourself? What will you wish you had done when that day comes? If you’re ready to dig deep for the answers, let’s go. 🌱\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The author envisions a movement where individuals courageously pursue a life true to themselves by focusing on what is essential rather than conforming to others' expectations."
