  "text": "**Multitasking vs. Multifocusing**\n\nI ran into an old classmate years after we graduated from Stanford. I was on campus working on my laptop when he came over to say hi. After some small talk, he mentioned he was between jobs and asked if I could help him out. I started asking questions to see how I could assist, but just twenty seconds in, he got a text. Without a word, he looked down and began replying. I did what I usually do in that situation‚ÄîI paused and waited.\n\nTen seconds passed. Then twenty. I stood there while he typed away, completely ignoring me. Out of curiosity, I wanted to see how long this would go on. After two full minutes (which feels like forever when you‚Äôre just standing there), I gave up, walked back to my desk, and returned to my work. A few minutes later, he finally came back to reality and wanted to continue our conversation about his job search. I had been ready to recommend him for a position I knew about, but after that incident, I felt hesitant. Sure, he‚Äôd be there in person, but would he really be present in mind?\n\nYou might expect me to rant about the downsides of multitasking‚Äîlike how a true Essentialist never tries to do more than one thing at a time. But honestly, we can handle two tasks at once: washing dishes while listening to music, eating and chatting, decluttering while thinking about lunch, texting while watching TV, and so on.\n\nWhat we can‚Äôt do is concentrate on two things at the same time. When I talk about being present, I mean focusing on one thing at a time. Multitasking isn‚Äôt the enemy of Essentialism; it‚Äôs pretending we can ‚Äúmultifocus‚Äù that trips us up. üß†‚ú®\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialists prioritize being focused on one task at a time rather than attempting to multitask, which leads to greater presence and effectiveness."
