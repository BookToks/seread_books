  "text": "- Waking up early and writing until 1:00 P.M. to finish this book.  \n- Pushing back a work deadline to go camping with my kids. üèïÔ∏è  \n- Not watching TV or movies while traveling for work, so I can think and recharge.  \n- Spending a whole day on one priority, even if it means ignoring my to-do list.  \n- Putting my novel on hold because it‚Äôs not the priority today.  \n- Keeping a journal almost every day for the last ten years.  \n- Saying no to a speaking gig so I can have date night with Anna.  \n- Swapping time on Facebook for regular calls with my 93-year-old grandpa.  \n- Turning down an offer to lecture at Stanford because it would take time away from spreading the message of Essentialism and being with family.  \n\nThis list goes on, but the key point is that focusing on what really matters is a choice. It‚Äôs your choice. And that‚Äôs super freeing.  \n\nYears ago, after quitting law school, I was figuring out my next move. With Anna as my sounding board, I explored tons of ideas. One day, driving home, I said, ‚ÄúWhat if I went to Stanford for grad school?‚Äù I had a lot of ‚ÄúWhat if?‚Äù moments, but this one clicked. I just knew this was the essential path for me.  \n\nWhat gave me that confidence? The clarity vanished whenever I thought about applying elsewhere. I started other applications but always stopped because it didn‚Äôt feel right. So, I focused solely on that one application. While waiting to hear back from the university, other tempting opportunities popped up, but I stayed the course.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Focusing on the essentials in life is a liberating choice that leads to clarity and fulfillment."
