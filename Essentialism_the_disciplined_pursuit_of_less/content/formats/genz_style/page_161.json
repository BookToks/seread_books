  "text": "We often think, “I can finish this project by Friday,” or “It’ll only take me a year to write my masterpiece.” But guess what? Things usually take longer than expected. Unexpected issues pop up, tasks get more complicated, or our initial estimates are just too optimistic. When that happens, we end up scrambling to fix things, and the results usually suffer. Maybe we pull an all-nighter, cut corners, submit something incomplete, or leave it to someone else to handle. Either way, we’re not performing at our best.\n\nEssentialists do it differently. They plan ahead. They prepare for surprises. They expect the unexpected. By creating a buffer for unforeseen events, they give themselves some breathing room when things go sideways, which they often do.\n\n**Nonessentialist vs. Essentialist**\n\n- Assumes the best-case scenario will happen  \n- Forces execution at the last minute  \n- Builds in a buffer for unexpected events  \n- Practices extreme and early preparation  \n\nWhen a Nonessentialist gets a windfall, they tend to spend it instead of saving for a rainy day. A clear example? When Britain discovered North Sea oil in 1980, the government suddenly had a massive boost in tax revenue—about £166 billion ($250 billion) over ten years. There are arguments for how that money was used, but one thing is clear: it was spent. Instead of setting it aside for future challenges (like the coming recession), the British government used it elsewhere.\n\nIn contrast, Essentialists take advantage of good times to create a safety net for tougher days ahead. Norway also gained from oil taxes, but unlike Britain, Norway invested much of its windfall. 🌊\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The Essentialist prepares for the unexpected by planning ahead and creating buffers, while the Nonessentialist assumes the best-case scenario and reacts to problems as they arise."
