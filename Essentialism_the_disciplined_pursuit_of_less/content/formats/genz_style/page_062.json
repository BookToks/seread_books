  "text": "Creating space to explore is key—like asking a hundred questions and considering all the possibilities. An Essentialist doesn’t just zero in on one thing; they keep adjusting their focus to see the bigger picture.\n\nRecently, I met with Jeremy Utley at the d.school (a room with no seats, just walls covered in colorful Post-its). We’re working on a new class called “Designing Life, Essentially.” The goal? To help students design their lives.\n\nEach week, students get a chance to think deeply. They have to shut down their laptops and smartphones, activating the full power of their minds instead. They get assignments that teach them to figure out what’s truly essential among all the good options. \n\nYou don’t need to be at the d.school to do this. We can all learn to make more space in our lives. 🌟\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Creating space for exploration and focused thinking allows individuals to discern the essential from the non-essential in their lives."
