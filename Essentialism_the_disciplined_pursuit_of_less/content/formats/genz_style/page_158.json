  "text": "### CHAPTER 15: BUFFER  \n**The Unfair Advantage**  \n\n“Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.” — Abraham Lincoln  \n\nIn the Hebrew Bible, there’s a story about Joseph (yeah, the one with the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat) who saved Egypt from a brutal seven-year famine. Pharaoh had a dream that no one could figure out, not even his smartest advisors. Then someone remembered Joseph, who was in prison but known for interpreting dreams, so they called him in.  \n\nIn Pharaoh's dream, he saw seven “fat” cows come out of a river and graze in a meadow. Then, seven “lean” cows appeared and ate the fat ones. Joseph explained that the dream meant Egypt would have seven years of abundance, followed by seven years of famine. So, he advised Pharaoh to appoint someone “discreet and wise” to save a fifth of the harvest each year for seven years. This way, they’d have a buffer for the tough times. Pharaoh approved, and Joseph became the vizier (basically, second in command) of Egypt. He executed the plan flawlessly, so when the famine hit, everyone, including Joseph's family, was saved.  \n\nThis story highlights a key strategy that Essentialists use for smooth execution: creating buffers. We live in an unpredictable world. Beyond extreme events like famines, we constantly face unexpected challenges.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialists create buffers to prepare for the unpredictable challenges of life, ensuring effortless execution of their plans."
