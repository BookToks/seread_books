  "text": "**Road Map**\n\nThis book has four parts. The first part explains the core mindset of an Essentialist. The next three parts turn that mindset into a step-by-step process for the disciplined pursuit of less—something you can apply in any situation. Here’s a quick rundown of each part.\n\n**ESSENCE: WHAT IS THE CORE MINDSET OF AN ESSENTIALIST?**\n\nThis section lays out three key realities that make Essentialist thinking relevant and possible. Each reality gets its own chapter.\n\n1. **Individual choice:** We get to decide how we spend our time and energy. Without choice, there’s no point in talking about trade-offs.\n\n2. **The prevalence of noise:** Most things are just noise. Only a few things are super valuable. This is why it’s crucial to take time to figure out what truly matters. Finding those important things is totally worth the effort.\n\n3. **The reality of trade-offs:** We can’t have it all or do it all. If we could, we wouldn’t need to evaluate or cut options. Once we accept trade-offs, we stop asking, “How can I make it all work?” and start asking, “Which problem do I want to solve?”\n\nUnderstanding these realities is the first step to thinking like an Essentialist. Once we fully grasp them, the methods in the upcoming sections will feel natural and instinctive. That method has three simple steps.\n\n**STEP 1. EXPLORE: DISCERNING THE TRIVIAL MANY FROM THE VITAL FEW**\n\nHere’s the twist: Essentialists actually explore more options than Nonessentialists. While Nonessentialists commit to everything without really exploring, Essentialists take the time to sift through their choices.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The book outlines a systematic process for the disciplined pursuit of less, emphasizing the core mind-set of an Essentialist."
