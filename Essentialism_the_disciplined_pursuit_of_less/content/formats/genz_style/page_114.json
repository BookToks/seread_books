  "text": "Without clear direction, people chase after their own short-term goals, often missing the bigger picture of how their actions impact the team’s long-term mission. Sure, these activities might be well-meaning, and some could even be essential for individuals. But when everyone’s off doing their own thing, it can lead to chaos instead of progress. It’s like taking five steps back for every step forward.\n\nThe same goes for individuals juggling too many different activities—even if they’re all good. If these efforts don’t work together, they won’t create anything meaningful. For example, trying to earn five different majors, all solid choices, doesn’t equal a degree. Similarly, hopping between five different jobs in various fields won’t build a coherent career. Without clarity and purpose, just doing something because it’s good isn’t enough to make a real impact. As Ralph Waldo Emerson put it, “The crime which bankrupts men and states is that of job-work;—declining from your main design to serve a turn here or there.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Without clear direction, individuals and teams may pursue well-intentioned activities that ultimately detract from their long-term mission and contributions."
