  "text": "### The Best Slice of Pizza in Brooklyn\n\nUsing stricter criteria for big life choices helps us access our brain's powerful search capabilities. It’s like searching for “best slice of pizza in downtown Brooklyn” instead of just “good restaurant in New York City.” When we look for “a good career opportunity,” our brains can throw up tons of options to sift through. But what if we flipped the script and asked three key questions: “What am I super passionate about?” “What showcases my talents?” and “What meets a real need in the world?” Sure, there won’t be as many results, but that’s the point. We’re not after a bunch of decent options; we want the one where we can make our biggest impact. 🍕\n\nTake Enric Sala, for example. He found his true calling this way. Early in his career, he was a professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. But he felt like he was on the wrong track. So, he left academia and joined National Geographic. With that success came tempting new opportunities in Washington, D.C., but he still felt off course. \n\nLike many driven people, earlier wins distracted him from his real purpose. Ever since he watched Jacques Cousteau on the Calypso, he dreamed of diving in the world's most stunning oceans. After a few years, when a golden opportunity came up, he switched gears again. He became an explorer-in-residence with National Geographic, diving in remote spots while using his science and communication skills to influence global policy. \n\nThe cost of his dream job? Saying no to many good (even great) opportunities along the way and waiting for the one he could truly get excited about. And that wait? Totally worth it. Enric is a rare example of someone who loves his work, leverages his talents, and serves a crucial need. 🌊\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Applying stricter criteria to major life decisions helps individuals identify and pursue their highest contributions."
