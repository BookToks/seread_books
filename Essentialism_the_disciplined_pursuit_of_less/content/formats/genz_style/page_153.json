  "text": "When you water your lawn, but your neighbor Bill benefits instead, it’s a problem. Your grass is brown and dying while Bill enjoys his lush yard. He thinks, “My yard is great!” Everyone loses: your effort is wasted, and Bill never learns to take care of his own lawn. The fix? As Cloud says, “You need fences to keep his problems out of your yard and in his, where they belong.” \n\nAt work, people often try to use your time and energy for their own gain. This could be a boss who puts you on a committee for her side project, a colleague asking for your input on a report she hasn’t even finished, or someone who chats you up in the hallway when you’re rushing to an important meeting. \n\nWhoever it is trying to drain your time, the solution is simple: put up fences. Don’t wait until they ask for something—set clear boundaries ahead of time. This way, you can avoid time-wasters and boundary-pushers. Plus, making them handle their own issues benefits both you and them. \n\nBOUNDARIES ARE A SOURCE OF LIBERATION\n\nThis idea is illustrated by a school next to a busy road. At first, kids only played close to the building where adults could keep an eye on them. Then, they put up a fence around the playground. Suddenly, the kids had the freedom to play anywhere on the playground. Their play area doubled! \n\nWhen we don’t set clear boundaries in our lives, we can feel trapped by what others impose on us. But when we have those boundaries, we can choose from a wider range of options that we’ve intentionally picked out. 🌟\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Setting clear boundaries allows individuals to protect their time and energy, leading to greater freedom and productivity."
