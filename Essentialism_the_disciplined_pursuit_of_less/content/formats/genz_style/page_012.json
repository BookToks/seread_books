  "text": "The Essentialist way leads to real progress in what truly matters. It throws out the myth that we can do it all. Instead, it forces us to face tough choices and trade-offs. Sometimes, we can make one-time decisions that simplify future choices, saving us from wearing ourselves out with the same questions over and over.\n\nLiving as an Essentialist means being intentional, not just going with the flow. Instead of reacting to everything, the Essentialist picks out the vital few things that matter and cuts out the noise. They remove obstacles so that the important stuff can flow easily. In short, Essentialism is a smart, structured way to find where we can make the biggest impact and then make it easy to get there. \n\n**The Model**\n\n**Nonessentialist**  \n- Thinks: ALL THINGS TO ALL PEOPLE  \n- Says: “I have to.” “It’s all important.” “How can I fit it all in?”\n\n**Essentialist**  \n- Thinks: LESS BUT BETTER  \n- Says: “I choose to.” “Only a few things really matter.” “What are the trade-offs?”  \n\n**The Undisciplined** vs. **The Disciplined**\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialism is a disciplined approach that focuses on making deliberate choices about what truly matters, rejecting the notion of fitting everything in."
