When her manager, Hyori, asked her to create the presentation, Jin-Yung poured in countless hours to get it done. But after grinding through the task, she spotted major flaws in how she was managing things. She realized that to be a better manager, she needed to set clear expectations and accountability with her team. In the end, she was thankful to Jin-Yung for helping her see where she went wrong. By setting boundaries, Jin-Yung opened Hyori’s eyes to unhealthy team dynamics and created space for change, earning her respect and gratitude.\n\nThese blurred boundaries are common in our Nonessentialist world. Technology has really messed up the lines between work and home. Nowadays, people expect us to be \"on\" all the time. I once had an assistant suggest a Saturday morning meeting, even though there was no rush and Saturday isn’t exactly a typical workday. It makes you wonder if Saturday is the new Friday. \n\nWhat many don’t realize is that the issue isn’t just about blurred lines; work has creepily invaded family time. Imagine executives being okay with employees bringing their kids to work on a Monday, yet they have no problem expecting them to work on weekends. \n\nClayton Christensen, a Harvard business professor, faced a similar situation. While working at a consulting firm, a partner asked him to come in on Saturday for a project. Clay simply said, “Sorry, I’ve committed to spending Saturdays with my family.” The partner wasn’t happy and left in a huff, but later returned, saying the team would come in on Sunday instead. Clay sighed and replied, “I appreciate that, but Sunday is my day for God, so I can’t come in.” If the partner was annoyed before, he was definitely more frustrated now.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Setting clear boundaries is essential for effective management and maintaining a healthy work-life balance."
