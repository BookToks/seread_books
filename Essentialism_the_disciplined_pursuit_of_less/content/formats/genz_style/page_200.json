  "text": "**CHAPTER 20**  \n**THE ESSENTIALIST LIFE**  \n**BEWARE THE BARRENNESS OF A BUSY LIFE.**  \n—Socrates  \n\nIt all started when he was training to be a lawyer in England. With a rich family and solid career prospects, life seemed great. Every morning, he woke up feeling sure about his path: get ready to be a lawyer and live comfortably. But then he took a trip around the world, and everything changed.  \n\nMohandas K. Gandhi went to South Africa and witnessed oppression. Suddenly, he found a bigger purpose: liberating the oppressed everywhere. With this new focus, he stripped away everything else from his life. He called it “reducing himself to zero.”  \n\nHe wore his own handmade cloth (called khadi) and motivated others to do the same. For three years, he didn’t read any newspapers because they just cluttered his mind with unnecessary info. He spent thirty-five years simplifying his diet. He even took one day a week to not speak at all. Saying he avoided consumerism is an understatement: when he passed away, he owned fewer than ten items.  \n\nBut the most important part? He dedicated his life to helping India gain independence. He never held a political title, yet he became known as the “Father of the Nation” in India. His impact went far beyond India. As General George C. Marshall, the American Secretary of State, noted…\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Gandhi transformed his life by eliminating distractions and dedicating himself to the liberation of the oppressed, embodying the essence of essentialism."
