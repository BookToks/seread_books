  "text": "Employees should pick one main priority in their role and focus solely on that. PayPal exec Keith Rabois remembers: “Peter made sure everyone had exactly one priority. He wouldn’t talk about anything else except your #1 initiative. Even our annual review forms in 2001 asked each employee to state their single most valuable contribution to the company.” \n\nThis approach empowered employees to do anything within that clearly defined role that would significantly contribute to the company's mission.\n\n**COMMUNICATE THE RIGHT THINGS TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE AT THE RIGHT TIME**\n\nNonessentialist leaders communicate in code, leaving people confused about what anything really means. Their communication is often too vague to act on or changes so fast that everyone feels caught off guard. Essentialist leaders, however, get straight to the point. They share the right info with the right people at the right time. \n\nThese leaders keep it simple and focused. When they do speak, they are crystal clear. They ditch the jargon, making their message so consistent it might even sound boring. This clarity helps teams cut through the noise and focus on what truly matters.\n\n**CHECK IN OFTEN TO ENSURE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS**\n\nNonessentialist leaders struggle with accountability. The more goals they chase, the harder it is to follow up on all of them. They might even train their teams to expect no follow-up at all. As a result, team members learn they can cut corners or prioritize what's easy over what’s important without any consequences. They see that each objective from the leader gets attention for a moment before being replaced by something else that catches their eye.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialist leaders empower employees to focus on a single priority, ensuring clear communication and accountability for meaningful progress."
