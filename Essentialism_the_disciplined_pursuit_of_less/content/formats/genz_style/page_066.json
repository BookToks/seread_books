  "text": "### Space to Read\n\nLet‚Äôs take a cue from Bill Gates. This CEO takes a week off from Microsoft every year just to think and read. I once saw him speak at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle right after he finished one of these ‚ÄúThink Weeks.‚Äù I learned that he‚Äôs been doing this since the 1980s, even during Microsoft‚Äôs biggest growth spurt. \n\nTwice a year, no matter how hectic things got, he carved out a whole week to read articles (his record is 112!) and books, dive into tech, and reflect on the big picture. Even now, he steps away from the daily grind to just think. \n\nIf a whole week feels like too much, you can still squeeze a little ‚ÄúThink Week‚Äù into your daily routine. One trick I use is to read classic literature for the first twenty minutes of my day. This helps me avoid the urge to check emails right when I wake up and sets a positive tone for my day. It opens my mind and connects me with timeless ideas.\n\nI lean towards inspirational reads, but you do you. Here are some classics to think about: *Zen, the Reason of Unreason*, *The Wisdom of Confucius*, *The Torah*, *The Holy Bible*, *Tao, to Know and Not Be Knowing*, *The Meaning of the Glorious Koran*, *As a Man Thinketh*, *The Essential Gandhi*, *Walden, or, Life in the Woods*, *The Book of Mormon*, *The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius*, and *The Upanishads*. There are tons of options! Just pick something written before our hyperconnected world that still feels relevant. These works can really challenge what we think matters. \n\nWhether you can dedicate two hours a day, two weeks a year, or even just a few minutes, make space for reflection. üß†üìö\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Creating dedicated time for reflection and reading, as exemplified by Bill Gates' \"Think Week,\" can enhance focus and broaden perspective amidst daily distractions."
