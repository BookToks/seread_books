  "text": "CHAPTER 2  \nCHOOSE  \nThe Invincible Power of Choice  \n\nIt’s our ability to choose that makes us human. —Madeleine L’Engle  \n\nI sat there, eyes wide, holding a piece of paper. I was in the lobby of a tall office building as dusk settled in. People were leaving for the day, but I was focused on my paper, filled with scribbles and arrows. It was the result of a twenty-minute brainstorm about what I really wanted to do with my life.  \n\nWhat struck me most? Law school wasn’t on that list. This was a big deal because I was halfway through my first year at law school in England.  \n\nI had chosen law because everyone kept telling me to “keep your options open.” Once I graduated, I could practice law, write about it, teach it, or consult on it. The world was supposed to be my oyster. But instead of picking one path, I tried to do it all. I crammed law studies into every hour of the day, read management books at night, and squeezed in some writing whenever I could. It was a classic “straddled strategy” — trying to invest in everything at once.  \n\nThe result? I wasn’t failing at anything, but I wasn’t succeeding at anything either. I started to question what was so great about having all these options.  \n\nIn the midst of this confusion, a friend from the U.S. called to invite me to his wedding. He had already bought my ticket! Grateful, I accepted the invite. ✈️\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The power of choice is fundamental to our humanity, as illustrated by the author's realization that law school was not aligned with his true desires."
