  "text": "**Figure Out What’s Most Important Right Now**  \nWhat’s on your mind for tomorrow or even an hour from now? If you're unsure, jot down everything pulling at your attention and cross off anything that isn’t important right now. Keep it simple.  \n\n**Get the Future Out of Your Head**  \nClearing your mind of future worries helps you focus on what matters now. I sat down and listed things that could be essential—just not at this moment. I opened my journal and asked myself, “What do I want to do someday because of today?” This wasn’t a to-do list; it was a way to get my ideas out of my head and onto paper. Two things happened: I wouldn’t forget those ideas (they might be useful later), and it eased that nagging feeling that I had to act on them immediately.  \n\n**Prioritize**  \nNext, I prioritized my lists. I tackled each item on the “what is essential now” list one by one. I calmly worked through it and crossed off each completed task. By the time I hit the pillow, I had not only finished everything I needed to do but did it better and faster because I was focused. 💤\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Focusing on what is essential in the present moment enhances productivity and reduces stress."
