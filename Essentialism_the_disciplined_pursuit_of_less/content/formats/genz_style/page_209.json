  "text": "### MORE JOY IN THE JOURNEY\n\nWhen you focus on what really matters right now, you can live life to the fullest. For me, being present has led to joyful memories I wouldn’t have made otherwise. I find myself smiling more, appreciating the simple things, and feeling happier overall. \n\nAs the Dalai Lama, a true Essentialist, puts it: “If your life is simple, contentment will follow. Simplicity is key to happiness.” 😊\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Focusing on what is truly important allows for a more joyful and content life in the present moment."
