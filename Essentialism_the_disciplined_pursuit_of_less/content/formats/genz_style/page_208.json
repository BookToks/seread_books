  "text": "I said no to all the distractions. Even though I didn’t know if I’d get in, I felt calm and focused. I was in control. \n\nI applied to Stanford only twice. When I finally got my acceptance the second time, it hit me: this was the most important thing I could be doing. It was the right choice at the right time. It was a personal nod to the Essentialist way of life.\n\nIf I hadn’t chosen to be an Essentialist, I might never have gone all in on the “Stanford or bust” plan. I wouldn’t have written for the Harvard Business Review. And I definitely wouldn’t be sharing these thoughts with you now—thoughts that could help you rethink your own life.\n\nBecoming an Essentialist takes time, but the perks are endless. Here’s how focusing on less can seriously improve your life.\n\n**MORE CLARITY**  \nRemember that metaphorical closet from chapter 1? As you keep clearing out your life’s clutter, you’ll start to see what really matters. Life won’t just be about checking off tasks or rushing through your day. It’ll be about choosing what goes on your schedule in the first place. Each day, it becomes clearer that the essential things are way more important than the next “urgent” task. This makes tackling those essentials feel effortless.\n\n**MORE CONTROL**  \nYou’ll feel more confident in your ability to pause, push back, or take your time. You won’t just be a pawn in other people’s agendas. If you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will. But if you commit to prioritizing your own life, you can. The power is yours. It’s all within you. 💪\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Becoming an Essentialist leads to greater clarity and control in prioritizing what truly matters in life."
