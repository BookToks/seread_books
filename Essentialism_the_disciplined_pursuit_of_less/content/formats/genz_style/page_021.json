  "text": "“Pri-1, Pri-2, Pri-3, Pri-4, and Pri-5” might sound like priorities, but it really means nothing is a priority. When we try to do everything, we end up making compromises we’d never choose on purpose. If we don’t decide where to focus our time and energy, others—like bosses, colleagues, clients, and even family—will decide for us. Soon, we might forget what truly matters. We can either make our own choices or let other people’s agendas run our lives.\n\nAn Australian nurse named Bronnie Ware, who cared for people in their last weeks, noted their biggest regrets. The top one? “I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.” \n\nThis means we need to say no on purpose—not just haphazardly. We should strategically cut out nonessentials, which includes letting go of some good opportunities too.\n\nInstead of letting social pressures drag you in all directions, learn to simplify and focus on what’s truly essential by eliminating everything else. \n\nThink of this book as a professional organizer for your life and career. Imagine your closet when you never organize it. It doesn’t stay neat with just your favorite outfits. Nope! Without effort, it gets cluttered with clothes you hardly wear. You might try to clean it out, but without a solid plan, you’ll end up with just as many clothes as before. You might regret giving away stuff you actually liked or keep a pile of clothes you don’t want but don’t know how to get rid of.\n\nJust like our closets, our lives get cluttered with well-meaning commitments and activities we’ve said yes to. Most of these don’t serve us. 🧹\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To live a meaningful life, we must deliberately eliminate nonessentials and focus on what truly matters, rather than allowing others to dictate our priorities."
