  "text": "# CHAPTER 3  \n## DISCERN  \n### The Unimportance of Practically Everything  \n\nMost things in the universe—our actions, resources, and ideas—aren't that valuable and don’t really get us anywhere. But a few things? They work wonders and make a huge impact.  \n\nIn George Orwell’s classic book *Animal Farm*, there's a character named Boxer the horse. He’s loyal and strong, always saying, “I will work harder” whenever there’s a problem. He sticks to this mindset until he’s worn out and sent away to a place that’s not good for him. Boxer is a tragic figure: even with the best intentions, his endless effort only makes things worse on the farm.  \n\nCan we sometimes be like Boxer? Do we hit setbacks and think, “I just need to work harder”? Do we say “Yes, I can handle this too!” when challenges come up? We’ve been told since we were kids that hard work equals results, and many of us have been rewarded for pushing through every task life throws at us. But for those of us who already work hard, is there a limit to how much hard work helps? Is there a point where doing more doesn’t really lead to more? Could doing less (but thinking more) actually get us better results?  \n\nWhen I was a kid, I wanted to earn some pocket money. One of the few jobs for twelve-year-olds in England was a paper route. It paid about a pound a day and took about an hour. So, for a while, I lugged around a bag that felt heavier than I was, going door to door each morning before school. (And just so you know, we couldn’t just toss the paper on the porch like they do in some places.)\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Most of what we do has little value, and focusing on a few impactful actions can yield better results."
