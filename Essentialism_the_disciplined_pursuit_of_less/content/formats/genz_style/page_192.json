  "text": "### There Is Only Now\n\nThink about how this applies to your life. Ever feel stuck replaying past mistakes like a broken record? ðŸŽ¥ Do you waste time stressing over the future? Do you focus more on what you canâ€™t control instead of what you can? Are you busy prepping for the next meeting or assignment instead of being present in the moment? Itâ€™s totally normal to obsess over the past or worry about whatâ€™s ahead. But every second spent on that distracts you from what truly matters right now. \n\nThe ancient Greeks had two words for time. The first is *chronos*. This is the ticking clock time we all know, the one we race against. The second is *kairos*. Itâ€™s harder to translate, but it means the right or perfect time. *Chronos* is all about numbers; *kairos* is about quality. You only experience *kairos* when youâ€™re fully in the momentâ€”when you exist in the now.\n\nItâ€™s wild to think that we only ever have now. We canâ€™t control the future, just the present. Sure, we learn from the past and can imagine the future, but we can only act on what matters in the here and now.\n\nNonessentialists get so caught up in past wins and losses, along with future challenges, that they miss the present. They become distracted and unfocused. They arenâ€™t really there. \n\nThe Essentialist way? Tune into the present. Experience life in *kairos*, not just *chronos*. Focus on whatâ€™s truly importantâ€”not yesterday or tomorrow, but right now. ðŸŒŸ\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Focusing on the present moment is essential for effectively engaging with what truly matters in life."
