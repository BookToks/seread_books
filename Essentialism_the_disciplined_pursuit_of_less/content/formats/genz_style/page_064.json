Not only did I finish my book faster, but I also took control of my time. \n\nWhen was the last time you actually took a break just to think? I don’t mean the five minutes during your commute where you’re just planning your to-do list. I mean setting aside time in a distraction-free zone to do nothing but think. \n\nThis is tougher than ever in our tech-filled, overstimulated lives. A leader at Twitter once asked me, “Do you remember what it was like to be bored? It doesn’t happen anymore.” And he’s right. A few years back, if you were stuck in an airport or a waiting room, you just sat there, staring into space. Now, everyone’s glued to their devices. Sure, nobody likes boredom, but by eliminating it, we’ve also lost the time we used to have to think and process stuff. \n\nHere’s a twist: the busier things get, the more we need to schedule thinking time. And the noisier it gets, the more we need quiet spaces to really focus. \n\nNo matter how busy you feel, you can find time to think during your workday.

This practice came about when back-to-back meetings left him no time to process what was happening around him. \n\nAt first, it felt like a luxury, like wasting time. But eventually, he realized it was his most valuable productivity tool. It helps him take charge of his day instead of just reacting to it. He told me about one day when he was on conference calls or in meetings from 5:00 A.M. to 9:00 P.M. At the end of that day, he felt...\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Creating distraction-free time for reflection and thinking is essential for productivity and maintaining control over one's schedule."
