  "text": "**The 90 Percent Rule**\n\nRecently, a colleague and I had to pick twenty-four people from almost one hundred applicants for our ‚ÄúDesign Your Life, Essentially‚Äù class. First, we set some basic criteria, like ‚ÄúCan attend every class.‚Äù Then, we defined ideal traits, like ‚ÄúIs ready for a life-changing experience.‚Äù We scored each candidate on a scale of 1 to 10. The 9s and 10s were in for sure, while anyone under a 7 was out. My tough job? Figuring out the 7s and 8s. \n\nAs I wrestled with who to choose, I realized something: if a candidate is just okay‚Äîlike a 7 or an 8‚Äîthe answer should be a no. That was a game-changer.\n\nThis is what I call the 90 Percent Rule. You can use it for almost any decision. When you‚Äôre weighing an option, think about the most important factor for that choice. Then give it a score from 0 to 100. If it‚Äôs below 90, just score it a 0 and reject it. This keeps you from getting stuck in indecision or settling for mediocre options. Imagine scoring a 65 on a test‚Äîwhy would you want to feel that way about an important life choice? ü§î\n\nMastering this Essentialist skill means being real about trade-offs. Choosing high standards is a trade-off; sometimes you‚Äôll have to pass on a pretty good option, trusting that a perfect one will come along. It might, or it might not, but the key is that you get to pick which perfect option to wait for, instead of letting others or fate decide for you. Like any Essentialist skill, it helps you make choices on purpose, not by chance.\n\nThe perks of this super-selective decision-making approach are clear: when your criteria are too loose, you end up saying yes to too many options.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The 90 Percent Rule encourages making decisions by rejecting any option that scores below 90 percent, promoting a disciplined approach to selecting only the best choices in life."
