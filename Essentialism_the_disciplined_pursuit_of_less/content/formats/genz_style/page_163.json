As a result, Scott’s team faced exhaustion, hunger, and frostbite, while Amundsen’s crew had a smoother trip. In the end, Amundsen succeeded, but Scott and his team tragically lost their lives.\n\nThis lesson in extreme preparedness applies to business too. Jim Collins and Morten Hansen studied 7 companies out of 20,400 and found that the successful ones didn’t predict the future any better than the others. They just accepted that surprises happen and prepared for them.\n\n**ADD 50 PERCENT TO YOUR TIME ESTIMATE**  \nI know someone who thinks it takes her five minutes to get to the store because she once made it in that time. But usually, it takes ten to fifteen minutes. This isn’t just a small issue; it’s a pattern in her life. She’s always late and constantly stressed and guilty about it. After years of this, she doesn’t even realize she’s living in stress. It’s even affected her health. Yet, she still believes she can make it to the store in five minutes or finish a conference call in half an hour. Occasionally, she pulls it off, but the costs to her and those around her are high. If she just allowed some extra time, she’d do much better.\n\nHave you ever misjudged how long a task will take? You’re not alone. This common issue is called the “planning fallacy.” Coined by Daniel Kahneman in 1979, it describes how people often underestimate the time needed for tasks, even if they’ve done them before.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Amundsen's success in extreme conditions highlights the importance of preparedness and realistic time estimation in achieving goals."
