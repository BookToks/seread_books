  "text": "When kids read for thirty minutes, they earn extra tokens. Those tokens can be traded for screen time or cash. The results? Mind-blowing. Screen time dropped by 90%, while reading shot up the same amount. Plus, we spent way less time managing the whole thing. Basically, nonessential activities plummeted, and essential ones skyrocketed. Once we set up the system with a bit of effort, it ran smoothly.\n\nWe can create similar systems at home or work. The trick is to start small, encourage progress, and celebrate little wins. Here are some tips.\n\n**FOCUS ON MINIMAL VIABLE PROGRESS**  \nIn Silicon Valley, there's a saying: “Done is better than perfect.” This doesn’t mean we should churn out junk. It’s about not wasting time on nonessentials and just getting things done. Entrepreneurs talk about a “minimal viable product.” \n\nThe idea is to ask, “What’s the simplest product that’s still useful and valuable?” We can apply this to “minimal viable progress.” Ask yourself, “What’s the smallest amount of progress that’s useful for the essential task I’m working on?” \n\nI used this method while writing this book. Before I even started typing, I’d share short ideas on Twitter (my minimal viable product). If people connected with those ideas, I’d expand them into blog pieces for the Harvard Business Review. This way, I found what resonated with others without much effort.\n\nPixar does something similar with their movies. Instead of starting with a full script, they kick things off with storyboards (like a comic version of the movie). They test ideas to see what clicks. They repeat this in small cycles hundreds of times. Then, they show the movie to small groups for early feedback. This helps them learn quickly with minimal effort. 🎬✨\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Investing small initial efforts in creating systems can lead to significant reductions in nonessential activities and increases in essential activities."
