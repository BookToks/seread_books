  "text": "In the first pattern, teams get way too focused on impressing the boss. The issue? When people don’t know the end goal, they’re lost on how to succeed. So, they make up their own games and rules just to win the manager’s approval. Instead of actually contributing, they waste time trying to outshine their coworkers, show off, or just parrot the manager’s ideas. This kind of behavior isn’t just useless; it’s harmful and counterproductive. 🚫\n\nWe do this in our personal lives too. When we’re unclear about our real purpose—like our goals, dreams, and values—we create our own social games. We spend time trying to look better than others. We obsess over things that don’t really matter, like having a fancier car or house, or even how many followers we have on social media. This leads us to ignore what’s truly important, like hanging out with loved ones, nurturing our spirit, or taking care of our health. 🧘‍♀️\n\n**PATTERN 2: IT’S ALL GOOD (WHICH IS BAD)**  \nIn the second pattern, teams without a clear purpose become leaderless.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** When teams lack a clear purpose, they engage in counterproductive activities focused on gaining favor rather than making meaningful contributions."
