  "text": "He said, with a lot of feeling, “That is the story of my life!” I quickly sketched an image beside us. “What if we could figure out the one thing you could do that would make the biggest impact?” I asked. He replied earnestly, “That is the question.”\n\nTurns out, a lot of smart, driven people struggle to answer this. Why? Because in our society, we get punished for saying no (which is the right choice) and rewarded for saying yes (which can be the wrong choice). Saying no feels awkward, while saying yes gets applause. This creates what I call “the paradox of success,” which unfolds in four predictable phases:\n\n**PHASE 1:** When we know our purpose, we succeed at what we set out to do.\n\n**PHASE 2:** Success earns us a reputation as the “go-to” person. We become “good old [insert name],” always available when needed, leading to more options and opportunities.\n\n**PHASE 3:** More options and opportunities really mean more demands on our time and energy. We start to spread ourselves too thin.\n\n**PHASE 4:** We get distracted from what truly matters—our highest contributions. Ironically, our success can cloud the very clarity that helped us succeed in the first place.\n\nIn short, chasing success can sometimes set us up for failure. Success can pull us away from focusing on the essentials that originally brought us success.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The paradox of success reveals that achieving clarity of purpose can lead to distractions and diluted efforts, ultimately undermining the very success it initially fosters."
