  "text": "We can’t predict traffic. Flights might get delayed or canceled. We could slip on a wet road tomorrow and get hurt. At work, suppliers might be late, colleagues might mess up, or clients might change their minds at the last minute. The only thing we can count on is the unexpected. So, we can either wait and react or we can prepare. Enter the buffer. \n\nA “buffer” is basically something that keeps two things from crashing into each other. Think of a “buffer zone” around a protected area; it’s extra space to keep threats away.\n\nOnce, I tried explaining buffers to my kids while we were driving. I said, “Imagine we need to get to a place three miles away without stopping.” Right away, they saw the challenge. We couldn’t predict what would happen ahead—how long the light would stay green or if the car in front would suddenly brake. The only way to avoid a crash was to keep extra space between our car and the one ahead. That space acted as a buffer, giving us time to react to any surprises on the road. It helped us avoid sudden stops and starts.\n\nWe can apply this idea to our work and lives. Creating buffers reduces friction when we’re trying to focus on what really matters.\n\nDuring that car “game,” my kids noticed that when I got distracted and started chatting, I would forget about our buffer zone and get too close to the car in front. Then, I’d have to do something drastic—like swerve or hit the brakes at the last second. This can happen in our lives too. If we ignore our buffers, we get caught up in distractions. Suddenly, a project is due, or the big presentation day arrives, no matter how much extra time we thought we had. We’re forced to “swerve” or “slam on the brakes” at the last minute. Just like gases expand to fill their space, we often let our time and energy fill every moment, leaving no room for the unexpected.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Creating buffers in our lives helps us manage the unexpected and reduces friction in executing essential tasks."
