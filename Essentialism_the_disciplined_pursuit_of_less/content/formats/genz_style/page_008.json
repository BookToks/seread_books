  "text": "resources I have?” If he answered no, he’d say no to the request. At first, people looked a bit disappointed, but they quickly respected his honesty. Feeling encouraged by these small wins, he pushed back even more. Now, when a request came in, he paused and asked himself a tougher question: “Is this the most important thing I should be doing right now?” If he couldn’t say a clear yes, he refused. To his delight, his colleagues seemed disappointed at first but then respected him even more for standing his ground.\n\nFeeling empowered, he applied this selective thinking to everything, not just direct requests. In the past, he’d always volunteer for last-minute presentations or assignments. Now, he found ways to skip them. He used to jump into email threads right away, but now he let others take the lead. He stopped attending conference calls that only interested him a bit. He ditched the weekly update call because he didn’t need the info. He skipped meetings unless he had something valuable to contribute. As he put it, “Just because I was invited didn’t seem like a good enough reason to attend.”\n\nAt first, it felt selfish. But by being selective, he created space for himself, and in that space, he found creative freedom. He could focus on one project at a time, plan thoroughly, and anticipate roadblocks to clear them out. Instead of spinning his wheels trying to do everything, he got the right things done. His commitment to only doing what mattered restored the quality of his work. Instead of making tiny progress in a million directions, he built serious momentum toward the things that truly mattered.\n\nHe kept this up for several months and noticed he not only reclaimed his workday but also gained time at home. He said, “I got back my family life! I can go home at a decent time.” Instead of being tied to his phone, he was free. 😊\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** By selectively refusing non-essential requests, Sam Elliot regained control over his time and improved both his work quality and personal life."
