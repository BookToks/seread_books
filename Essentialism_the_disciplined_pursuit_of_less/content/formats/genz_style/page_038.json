  "text": "### The Invincible Power of Choosing to Choose\n\nWeâ€™ve spent way too long focusing on our options (the stuff we can pick from) and not enough on our own power to make choices (what we actually do). This isnâ€™t just wordplay; itâ€™s a big deal. Think about it: options can be snatched away, but our core ability to choose (aka free will) is ours forever. \n\nNo one can take that power from you or even hand it over. The only way to lose it is to forget it. ðŸ§ âœ¨\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** We often overlook our inherent ability to choose, focusing instead on external options that can be taken away."
