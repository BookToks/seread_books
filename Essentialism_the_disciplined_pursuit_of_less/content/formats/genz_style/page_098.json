  "text": "Assigning simple numbers to our choices helps us make decisions in a clear, logical way instead of just going with our gut or feelings. Sure, it takes discipline to stick to strict criteria, but not doing so can cost us big time.\n\nNonessentialists tend to rely on unspoken rules for their decisions, both at work and in life. For example, when picking projects, a Nonessentialist might think, “If my boss wants me to do it, I should.” Or even more broadly, “If someone asks me to do something, I should try it.” In today’s social media world, where we see what everyone else is doing, this mindset can pile on the pressure to engage in activities we don’t really need to.\n\nHere’s the difference:\n\n**Nonessentialist:**\n- Says yes to almost every request or opportunity.\n- Uses vague criteria like, “If someone I know is doing it, I should do it.”\n\n**Essentialist:**\n- Says yes only to the top 10% of opportunities.\n- Uses clear criteria like, “Is this exactly what I’m looking for?”\n\nOne executive team I worked with had three clear criteria for choosing projects. But over time, they got less picky, and soon the only rule seemed to be that a customer asked for it. This led to a dip in team morale—not just because they were overloaded, but because none of their projects felt meaningful. They lost their unique edge in the market, turning their once-special work into something too generic.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Nonessentialists make decisions based on implicit criteria, leading to overwhelm and lack of purpose, while essentialists use explicit criteria to focus on the most valuable opportunities."
