  "text": "Jeff Bezos, the Amazon guy, gets it. He says, “I’m more alert and I think more clearly. I just feel so much better all day long if I’ve had eight hours.” Mark Andreessen, who co-founded Netscape, used to skimp on sleep, working late into the night but still waking up at 7 A.M. Now he’s learned better. He admits, “Seven hours and I start to degrade. Six is suboptimal. Five is a big problem. Four means I’m a zombie.” On weekends, he catches up with over twelve hours of sleep. “It makes a big difference in my ability to function,” he says.\n\nThese execs are featured in an article titled “Sleep Is the New Status Symbol for Successful Entrepreneurs.” Nancy Jeffrey from the Wall Street Journal writes, “It’s official. Sleep, that rare commodity in stressed-out America, is the new status symbol.” Once seen as a weakness—remember the 80s mantra, “Lunch is for losers” and “Sleep is for suckers”?—now sleep is recognized as essential for a creative mind. It’s also key for the focused Essentialist mindset.\n\nIn a New York Times piece, Erin Callan, former CFO of Lehman Brothers, shares a story. At an office party in 2005, a colleague asked her husband what she did on weekends, knowing her as someone full of energy. Jokingly, she asked if Erin kayaked, rock climbed, or ran marathons. Her husband replied simply, “She sleeps.” And that was true. When she wasn’t working, she was recharging for the week ahead.\n\nIf sleep still has a bad rep at your job, think about starting a sleep initiative. Sounds wild? Consider the benefits—more creativity, better productivity, and even lower healthcare costs—that could boost the company’s bottom line. With this mindset, it’s easier to pitch your manager or HR on creating a sleep-friendly policy. Many companies already have rules about alcohol consumption, and the effects of sleep deprivation are just as serious. For example, Charles Czeisler at Harvard suggests that no one should be expected to drive to work after a red-eye flight.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sleep is increasingly recognized as essential for optimal performance and creativity in the workplace."
