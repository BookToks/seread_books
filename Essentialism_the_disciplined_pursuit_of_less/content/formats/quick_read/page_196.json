  "text": "How to Be in the Now\n\nWhat can we do to be fully present? \n\nHere are some simple techniques to consider. \n\nFIGURE OUT WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW\n\nI recently taught a full day on Essentialism to an executive team. \n\nI enjoyed the day and felt present throughout. \n\nBut when I returned to my room, I felt overwhelmed. \n\nEverything around me reminded me of what I could be doing. \n\nI could check my email, listen to messages, or read a book. \n\nI felt obligated to prepare a presentation for weeks ahead. \n\nI wanted to record interesting ideas from the day’s experiences. \n\nIt wasn’t just the number of tasks that overwhelmed me. \n\nIt was the familiar stress of many tasks competing for attention. \n\nAs anxiety and tension rose, I stopped. \n\nI knelt down and closed my eyes. \n\nI asked, “What’s important now?” \n\nAfter a moment, I realized I needed to figure out what was important. \n\nI stood up and tidied up my space. \n\nI put everything away in its proper place. \n\nI turned off my phone for relief. \n\nIt was nice to have a barrier from texts. \n\nI opened my journal and wrote about the day. \n\nWriting centered me. \n\nI made a list in pencil of all the things on my mind. \n\nThen I asked myself, “What do you need to do to sleep peacefully?” \n\nI decided it was essential to connect with my wife and children. \n\nNext, I wanted to make the morning effortless. \n\nI planned to schedule a wake-up call and breakfast in the room. \n\nI would get my slides loaded on the computer and iron my shirt. \n\nI crossed off the things that weren’t important right then. \n\nWhen faced with many tasks, stop. \n\nTake a deep breath. \n\nGet present in the moment. \n\nAsk yourself what is most important right now.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To be fully present, identify and focus on what is most important right now amidst distractions and obligations."
