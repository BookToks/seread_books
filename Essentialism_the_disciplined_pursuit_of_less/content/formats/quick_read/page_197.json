  "text": "what’s most important tomorrow or even an hour from now.  \n\nIf you’re not sure, make a list of everything vying for your attention.  \n\nCross off anything that is not important right now.  \n\nGET THE FUTURE OUT OF YOUR HEAD  \n\nGetting the future out of your head enables focus on “what is important now.”  \n\nMy next step was to sit down and list things that might be essential.  \n\nI opened to another page in my journal.  \n\nThis time, I asked myself, “What might you want to do someday as a result of today?”  \n\nThis was not a list of firm commitments.  \n\nIt was a way to get all of the ideas out of my head and on paper.  \n\nThis had two purposes.  \n\nFirst, it ensured I wouldn’t forget about those ideas.  \n\nThey might prove useful later.  \n\nSecond, it alleviated that stressful feeling to act upon them right now.  \n\nPRIORITIZE  \n\nAfter this, I prioritized each list.  \n\nThen I worked on each item on the “what is essential now” list one at a time.  \n\nI just calmly worked through the list.  \n\nI erased each item when it was complete.  \n\nBy the time I went to sleep, I had done all the things that needed execution.  \n\nI had executed them better and faster because I was focused.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Focusing on what is essential in the present moment enhances productivity and reduces stress."
