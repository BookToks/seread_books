  "text": "Think of the last time you were pulled over by the police.\n\nDid you wonder if it would be a good ticket or a bad one?\n\nNot likely. Everyone knows tickets are all bad, right?\n\nYet, at least one innovative police precinct in Richmond, Canada, disagrees.\n\nThey think this assumption should be challenged.\n\nThere is a well-established approach to cracking down on crime.\n\nPass new and harsher laws. Set stronger sentencing.\n\nInitiate zero-tolerance initiatives. Do more of what we already do.\n\nOnly do it more forcefully. \n\nFor years, the Richmond Police Department followed these practices.\n\nThey experienced typical results: recidivism rates at 65 percent.\n\nYouth crime was spiraling. \n\nThat changed when a young superintendent, Ward Clapham, arrived.\n\nHe challenged the status quo.\n\nHe asked why policing efforts had to be reactive and negative.\n\nWhat if, instead of just catching criminals, they focused on prevention?\n\nWhat if they could be tough on crime and also tough on its causes?\n\nOut of these questions came the novel idea for Positive Tickets.\n\nThis program focused on catching youth doing something positive.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The Richmond Police Department implemented a \"Positive Tickets\" program to encourage good behavior among youth instead of solely punishing criminal acts."
