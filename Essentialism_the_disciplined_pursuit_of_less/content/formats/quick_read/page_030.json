  "text": "An idea whose time has come.\n\nAs a quote attributed to Victor Hugo states, “Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come.”\n\n“Less but better” is a principle whose time has come.\n\nEverything changes when we allow ourselves to be selective.\n\nWe hold the key to unlock our next level of achievement.\n\nThere is tremendous freedom in eliminating the nonessentials.\n\nWe are no longer controlled by other people’s agendas.\n\nWe get to choose what we do.\n\nWith this power, we can discover our highest contribution.\n\nThis applies to our lives, careers, and the world.\n\nWhat if schools eliminated busywork?\n\nWhat if they replaced it with important projects?\n\nThese projects could benefit the whole community.\n\nWhat if students had time to think?\n\nThey could consider their highest contribution to their future.\n\nThey would not just start on a race to nowhere.\n\nWhat if businesses eliminated meaningless meetings?\n\nWhat if they created space for important projects?\n\nWhat if employees pushed back against time-wasting emails?\n\nThey could focus on their highest level of contribution.\n\nWhat if society stopped telling us to buy more stuff?\n\nWhat if it allowed us to breathe and think?\n\nWhat if society encouraged us to reject unnecessary purchases?\n\nWe often buy things we don’t need.\n\nWe spend money we don’t have.\n\nWe try to impress people we don’t like.\n\nWhat if we stopped being oversold on having more?\n\nWhat if we appreciated the value of having less?\n\nWhat if we stopped celebrating busyness as importance?\n\nWhat if we celebrated time spent listening and enjoying?\n\nWhat if the world shifted to the disciplined pursuit of less?\n\nThis pursuit would be less but better.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The principle of \"less but better\" empowers individuals to eliminate nonessentials and focus on their highest contributions, leading to greater freedom and achievement."
