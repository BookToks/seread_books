  "text": "A food and beverage company exists.  \n\nIt manufactures milk, dairy, and soy products.  \n\nThe companyâ€™s main goal is to maximize stockholder value.  \n\nIt follows the laws of its operating jurisdictions.  \n\nIt observes the highest ethical standards at all times.  \n\nHow did you do?  \n\nIf you had no idea, you are not alone.  \n\nThe statements are largely indistinguishable.  \n\nThis makes the task almost impossible.  \n\nVague mission statements may be considered best practice.  \n\nBut they often fail to inspire employees.  \n\nThey do not provide a clear sense of purpose.  \n\nThis section is about eliminating nonessentials.  \n\nWe should focus on meaningful activities.  \n\nThe first type of nonessential to eliminate is misaligned activities.  \n\nThis sounds straightforward enough.  \n\nYou need to be clear about your purpose first.  \n\nThis is where this chapter comes in.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Vague mission statements fail to inspire employees and highlight the importance of clarity in defining purpose to eliminate nonessentials."
