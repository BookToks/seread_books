Saturday is family time.”  \n\nThe partner was displeased and left angrily.  \n\nLater, he returned with a new plan.  \n\nHe said the team would come in on Sunday.  \n\nHe expected Clay to be there too.  \n\nClay sighed and replied, “Sunday won’t work for me.”  \n\nHe had committed Sunday to God.  \n\nThe partner was even more frustrated now.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Setting clear boundaries is essential for effective management and maintaining a healthy work-life balance."
