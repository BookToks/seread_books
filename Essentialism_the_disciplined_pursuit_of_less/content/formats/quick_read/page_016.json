  "text": "“That is the story of my life!” he said emotionally.  \n\nI sketched the image on the right.  \n\n“What would happen if we figured out the one thing?” I asked him.  \n\nHe responded sincerely, “That is the question.”  \n\nMany intelligent, ambitious people struggle to answer this question.  \n\nOne reason is our society punishes good behavior, like saying no.  \n\nWe are rewarded for bad behavior, like saying yes.  \n\nSaying no feels awkward in the moment.  \n\nSaying yes is often celebrated in the moment.  \n\nThis leads to what I call “the paradox of success.”  \n\nIt can be summed up in four predictable phases:  \n\nPHASE 1:  \n\nClarity of purpose enables us to succeed at our endeavor.  \n\nPHASE 2:  \n\nSuccess gives us a reputation as a “go to” person.  \n\nWe become “good old [insert name],” always there when needed.  \n\nWe are presented with increased options and opportunities.  \n\nPHASE 3:  \n\nIncreased options and opportunities mean demands on our time.  \n\nThis leads to diffused efforts.  \n\nWe get spread thinner and thinner.  \n\nPHASE 4:  \n\nWe become distracted from our highest level of contribution.  \n\nOur success undermines the clarity that led to our success.  \n\nCuriously, the pursuit of success can be a catalyst for failure.  \n\nSuccess can distract us from focusing on essential things.  \n\nThese are the things that produce success in the first place.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The paradox of success reveals that achieving clarity of purpose can lead to distractions and diluted efforts, ultimately undermining the very success it initially fosters."
