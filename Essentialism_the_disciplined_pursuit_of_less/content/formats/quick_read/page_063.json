  "text": "One executive I know is intelligent and driven. \n\nHe is constantly distracted. \n\nAt any given time, he has Twitter, Gmail, Facebook, and multiple IM conversations going. \n\nTo create a distraction-free space, he tried pulling all the Internet cables. \n\nHe still found too many ways to get online. \n\nWhen struggling to complete a big project, he took desperate measures. \n\nHe gave his phone away and went to a motel without Internet. \n\nAfter eight weeks of almost solitary confinement, he finished the project. \n\nIt is a little sad he was driven to such measures. \n\nWhile his methods were extreme, I can’t argue with his intention. \n\nHe knew he needed space for unencumbered thought. \n\nThink of Sir Isaac Newton. \n\nHe spent two years working on Principia Mathematica. \n\nThis work covered universal gravitation and the three laws of motion. \n\nHis period of solitary confinement proved critical for breakthroughs. \n\nThese breakthroughs shaped scientific thinking for three hundred years. \n\nRichard S. Westfall wrote about Newton's discovery of gravitation. \n\nNewton replied, “By thinking on it continually.” \n\nWhat he thought on, he thought on continually. \n\nIn other words, Newton created space for intense concentration. \n\nThis uninterrupted space enabled him to explore essential elements of the universe. \n\nInspired by Newton, I took a similar approach to writing this book. \n\nI blocked off eight hours a day to write. \n\nI wrote from 5:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M., five days a week. \n\nThe rule was no e-mail, no calls, no appointments, and no interruptions. \n\nI didn’t always achieve it, but the discipline made a big difference. \n\nI set my e-mail bounce-back to explain my “monk mode.” \n\nIt is difficult to overstate how much freedom I found.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Creating a distraction-free space is essential for achieving deep concentration and making significant contributions to one's work."
