  "text": "FIND YOUR DEALBREAKERS  \n\nExecutives often struggle to identify their boundaries.  \n\nThey know they have boundaries, but can't express them.  \n\nIf you can't articulate them, others may not respect them.  \n\nThink of someone who pulls you off your essential path.  \n\nMake a list of your dealbreakers.  \n\nThese are requests or activities you refuse unless they align with your priorities.  \n\nAnother way to find dealbreakers is to note violations.  \n\nWrite down any time you feel violated by someone's request.  \n\nIt doesn't have to be extreme to notice it.  \n\nEven a small \"pinch\" can indicate a minor boundary violation.  \n\nA twinge of resentment can reveal hidden boundaries.  \n\nUnwanted invitations or small favors can be clues.  \n\nCRAFT SOCIAL CONTRACTS  \n\nI once worked with a colleague who had a different approach.  \n\nPeople predicted conflicts between us.  \n\nHowever, our relationship was harmonious.  \n\nI laid out my priorities at the start.  \n\nI explained what extra work I would and wouldn't take on.  \n\nI suggested we agree on our goals.  \n\nI shared what mattered to me.  \n\nI asked him to share his priorities too.  \n\nWe created a \"social contract.\"  \n\nThis helped us avoid wasting time.  \n\nWe avoided burdensome requests and distractions.  \n\nAs a result, we could contribute at our highest level.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Identifying and articulating personal boundaries, or dealbreakers, is essential for maintaining focus on one's priorities and achieving effective collaboration."
