  "text": "Get out into the field.  \n\nJane Chen was in a d.school class.  \n\nThe class was called “Design for Extreme Affordability.”  \n\nThey had to design a baby incubator.  \n\nThe cost target was 1 percent of $20,000.  \n\nJane said, “4 million low-birthweight children die within 28 days.”  \n\nThey die because they cannot regulate body temperature.  \n\nIf they had treated this as a cost problem,  \n\nthey would have made an inexpensive electric incubator.  \n\nThis seemed reasonable but missed the root problem.  \n\nInstead, they took time to find out what mattered.  \n\nThey went to Nepal to see the challenge firsthand.  \n\nThey discovered 80 percent of babies were born at home.  \n\nThese births happened in rural villages without electricity.  \n\nThe real challenge became clear to the team.  \n\nThey needed to create something that did not require electricity.  \n\nWith this insight, they began to solve the problem.  \n\nEventually, Jane and three teammates launched a nonprofit.  \n\nThey called it “Embrace.”  \n\nThey created the “Embrace Nest.”  \n\nThis incubator uses a waxlike substance heated in water.  \n\nThey place it in a sleeping bag-like pod.  \n\nIt can warm a baby for six hours or more.  \n\nBy exploring the problem fully,  \n\nthey clarified the question.  \n\nThis helped them focus on essential details.  \n\nUltimately, it allowed them to contribute significantly.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** By immersing themselves in the real-world context of their challenge, Jane Chen and her team were able to identify the true needs and create an effective, electricity-free solution for low-birthweight infants."
