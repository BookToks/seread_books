  "text": "Keep your eyes peeled for abnormal or unusual details.  \n\nMariam Semaan is an award-winning journalist from Lebanon.  \n\nShe recently completed a John S. Knight Journalism Fellowship at Stanford University.  \n\nShe specialized in media innovation and design thinking.  \n\nI asked her to share secret tips from her experience.  \n\nShe captures the real story amid all of the surface noise.  \n\nHer reaction was encouraging.  \n\nShe said finding the lead is a skill that can be acquired.  \n\nSpotting essential information is also a skill that can be learned.  \n\nShe emphasized the need for knowledge.  \n\nGetting to the essence of a story takes deep understanding.  \n\nYou must understand the topic and its context.  \n\nYou must see its fit into the bigger picture.  \n\nYou must know its relationship to different fields.  \n\nSo she reads all related news.  \n\nShe tries to spot the one piece of information others missed.  \n\nShe focuses on what others haven’t concentrated on enough.  \n\n“My goal,” she said, “was to understand the ‘spiderweb’ of the story.”  \n\nThis understanding helps her spot any abnormal or unusual detail.  \n\nThese details often don’t fit into the natural course of the story.  \n\nIt’s crucial, Mariam says, to seek a different perspective on a story.  \n\nThis perspective sheds light on the topic in a fresh way.  \n\nOne trick she uses is role play.  \n\nShe puts herself in the shoes of all the main players.  \n\nThis helps her better understand their motives, reasoning, and points of view.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Mariam Semaan emphasizes that acquiring the skill to identify essential information in storytelling requires deep knowledge and a fresh perspective."
