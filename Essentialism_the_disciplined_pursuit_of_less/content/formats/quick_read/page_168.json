  "text": "In your daily life, identify the “slowest hiker.”  \n\nA Nonessentialist reacts in a haphazard manner.  \n\nHe responds to crises instead of anticipating them.  \n\nHe applies quick-fix solutions.  \n\nThis is like plugging a hole in a leaking dam.  \n\nHe hopes the whole thing doesn’t burst.  \n\nBeing good with a hammer, he sees everything as a nail.  \n\nHe applies more pressure, creating more friction.  \n\nThis leads to frustration for everyone involved.  \n\nSometimes, the harder you push, the harder they push back.  \n\nEssentialists avoid Band-Aid solutions.  \n\nThey don’t just look for obvious obstacles.  \n\nThey seek what slows down progress.  \n\nThey ask, “What is getting in the way?”  \n\nWhile Nonessentialists pile on solutions,  \n\nEssentialists remove obstacles.  \n\nThey invest in removing barriers once.  \n\nThis method reduces efforts and maximizes results.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialists focus on removing obstacles to progress rather than applying quick-fix solutions, leading to greater results with less effort."
