  "text": "Employees select one single priority in their role. They focus on that exclusively. PayPal executive Keith Rabois recalls this practice. \n\nPeter required everyone to have exactly one priority. He would refuse to discuss anything else. This included what was currently assigned as their #1 initiative. \n\nIn 2001, annual review forms required each employee to identify their most valuable contribution. The result was employees felt empowered. They could do anything within their defined role. They aimed to make a high-level contribution to the company's shared mission. \n\nNonessentialist leaders communicate in code. People arenâ€™t sure what anything really means. Nonessentialist communication is too general or changes quickly. \n\nEssentialist leaders communicate the right things. They communicate to the right people at the right time. Essentialist leaders speak succinctly. They opt for restraint to keep the team focused. \n\nWhen they speak, they are crystal clear. They avoid meaningless jargon. Their message is consistent and may seem boring. Teams can pick up the essential through the trivial noise. \n\nThe nonessentialist leader struggles with accountability. The more items one pursues, the harder it is to follow up. A nonessentialist leader may train people to expect no follow-up. \n\nTeam members learn there are no repercussions for failing. They cut corners or prioritize what is easy over what is important. They see each objective emphasized only for a moment. Then it gives way to something else of momentary interest.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialist leaders empower employees to focus on a single priority, ensuring clear communication and accountability for meaningful progress."
