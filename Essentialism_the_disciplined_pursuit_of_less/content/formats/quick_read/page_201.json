  "text": "Mahatma Gandhi became the spokesman for the conscience of mankind. \n\nHe made humility and simple truth more powerful than empires. \n\nAlbert Einstein added that future generations will hardly believe this. \n\nHe said such a one as Gandhi walked upon this earth. \n\nIt is impossible to argue that Gandhi lived a life that mattered. \n\nWe donâ€™t have to replicate Gandhi to benefit from his example. \n\nHe lived fully and completely as an Essentialist. \n\nWe can purge our lives of the nonessential. \n\nWe can embrace the way of the Essentialist. \n\nWe can do this in our own ways and on our own scale. \n\nWe can live a life of simplicity, contribution, and meaning.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** We can all embrace the way of the Essentialist by purging nonessential elements from our lives to live with simplicity, high contribution, and meaning."
