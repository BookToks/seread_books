  "text": "A\n\nPPENDIX\n\nLeadership Essentials\n\nNEVER DOUBT THAT A SMALL GROUP OF THOUGHTFUL, COMMITTED CITIZENS CAN CHANGE THE WORLD; INDEED, IT’S THE ONLY THING THAT EVER HAS.\n\n—Margaret Mead\n\nLinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner sees “fewer things done better” as leadership's most powerful mechanism. \n\nWhen he took charge of the company, he had options. \n\nHe could have pursued everything like most Silicon Valley start-ups. \n\nInstead, he said no to really good opportunities. \n\nHe focused on pursuing only the very best ones. \n\nHe uses the acronym FCS (a.k.a. FOCUS) to teach his philosophy. \n\nThe letters stand for “Fewer things done better.” \n\nThey also mean “Communicating the right information to the right people at the right time.” \n\nThey mean “Speed and quality of decision making.” \n\nIndeed, this is what it means to lead essentially.\n\nESSENTIALIST TEAMS\n\nEssentialism as a way of thinking and acting is relevant to leadership. \n\nIt applies to how we lead companies and teams. \n\nIt also applies to how we lead our lives. \n\nMany ideas in this book became clear while working with executive teams. \n\nI have gathered data from over five hundred individuals. \n\nThey shared their experiences on more than one thousand teams. \n\nI asked them about times they worked on a unified team. \n\nThey described what the experience was like. \n\nThey shared what role their manager played. \n\nThey discussed what the end result was. \n\nThen I asked them to contrast this with a disunified team experience. \n\nThey described what that was like. \n\nThey shared what role their manager played. \n\nThey discussed how it affected the end result.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Leadership effectiveness is enhanced by focusing on fewer priorities to achieve better outcomes."
