  "text": "I took a course on nonprofits at Stanford.  \n\nOne assignment was to evaluate mission statements.  \n\nWe reviewed over one hundred examples in class.  \n\nSome grandiose missions were actually uninspiring.  \n\nOne mission aimed to “eliminate hunger in the world.”  \n\nHowever, it had only five people in the organization.  \n\nThe mission felt like empty words.  \n\nThen we saw a statement that inspired us.  \n\nIt came from Brad Pitt, an actor and social entrepreneur.  \n\nHe was appalled by the slow rebuilding of New Orleans.  \n\nHe started an organization called “Make It Right.”  \n\nIts essential intent was clear and focused.  \n\nThe goal was to build 150 affordable homes.  \n\nThese homes would be green and storm-resistant.  \n\nThey were for families in the Lower 9th Ward.  \n\nThat statement took the air out of the room.  \n\nThe objective's concreteness made it real.  \n\nThe realness made it inspiring.  \n\nIt answered the question: “How will we know when we have succeeded?”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Evaluating nonprofit mission statements revealed that specific, concrete goals, like Brad Pitt's \"Make It Right,\" are more inspiring than grandiose but vague ideals."
