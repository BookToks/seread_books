  "text": "What this means is that we can change our routine. \n\nWe don't need to change the behavior. \n\nWe need to find the cue. \n\nThe cue triggers the nonessential activity or behavior. \n\nWe must associate that cue with something essential. \n\nFor example, if a bakery triggers you, take action. \n\nIf you pass the bakery, pick up a salad instead. \n\nIf your alarm triggers you to check email, change it. \n\nUse the alarm to get up and read instead. \n\nAt first, it will be difficult to resist temptation. \n\nStopping at the bakery or checking email will be hard. \n\nEach time you execute the new behavior, it helps. \n\nEach time you pick up the salad, you strengthen the link. \n\nSoon, you’ll perform the new routine subconsciously. \n\nCREATE NEW TRIGGERS\n\nIf we want behavioral change, we can create new cues. \n\nWe can trigger essential routines with these new cues. \n\nI used this technique to write in a journal daily. \n\nIt worked wonders for me. \n\nFor a long time, I wrote sporadically. \n\nI would put it off all day. \n\nAt night, I’d rationalize, “I will do it in the morning.” \n\nInevitably, I wouldn’t write in the morning. \n\nBy the next night, I had two days’ worth to write. \n\nIt was overwhelming, so I put it off again. \n\nThen I heard someone’s routine about writing daily. \n\nThis seemed manageable, but I needed a cue. \n\nI started putting my journal in my bag next to my phone. \n\nWhen I pull my phone out to charge, I see the journal. \n\nThis cues me to write in it. \n\nNow, it is instinctive and natural. \n\nI look forward to it. \n\nIt has been ten years, and I have almost never missed a day. \n\nDO THE MOST DIFFICULT THING FIRST\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To change nonessential routines, we should identify and modify the cues triggering those behaviors, associating them with essential activities instead."
