  "text": "In a piece called “No More Yes. It’s Either HELL YEAH! Or No,”\n\nDerek Sivers describes a simple technique for making choices.\n\nThe key is to put the decision to an extreme test.\n\nIf we feel total conviction to do something, we say yes.\n\nAnything less gets a thumbs down.\n\nA leader at Twitter said, \"If the answer isn’t a definite yes, then it should be a no.\"\n\nThis is a succinct summary of a core Essentialist principle.\n\nIt is critical to the process of exploration.\n\nDerek lives this principle himself.\n\nWhen he wasn’t impressed by job candidates, he said no to all.\n\nEventually, he found the right person.\n\nHe signed up for conferences he wasn’t excited about.\n\nHe decided to stay home and skip them.\n\nHe earned twelve days to use for more productive ends.\n\nWhen deciding where to live, he ruled out good places.\n\nHe visited New York and knew it was the right place.\n\nThink back to our closets and the broad criterion.\n\n“Is there a chance that I will wear this someday?”\n\nThe closet becomes cluttered with rarely worn clothes.\n\nIf we ask, “Do I absolutely love this?” we can eliminate clutter.\n\nWe will have space for something better.\n\nWe can do the same with other areas of our lives.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Using extreme criteria for decision-making helps prioritize what truly matters and eliminate unnecessary clutter in our lives."
