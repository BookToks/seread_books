  "text": "I remember a friend who never asked for directions.  \n\nHe could never admit he was lost.  \n\nWe wasted time and energy driving in circles.  \n\nThis was a nonessential activity.  \n\nOnly when we admit our mistakes can we move on.  \n\nDenial keeps us circling pointlessly.  \n\nThere is no shame in admitting mistakes.  \n\nWe become wiser through our experiences.  \n\nIn the movie Tootsie, Dustin Hoffman plays a struggling actor.  \n\nHe tries to get work through a series of auditions.  \n\nAt one audition, he is told he is too old.  \n\nAt the next, he is told he is too young.  \n\nThen he is told he is the wrong height.  \n\nHe responds, “I can be taller.”  \n\nThe executive replies, “No. We need someone shorter.”  \n\nHoffman's character desperately tries to make it work.  \n\nHe says, “I don’t have to be this tall. I can be shorter.”  \n\nThe executive insists, “We’re looking for somebody different.”  \n\nThe would-be actor pushes back, “I can be different.”  \n\nWe often act like Hoffman’s character.  \n\nWe try too hard to be something we’re not.  \n\nIn our lives, we may force mismatches.  \n\nThe solution is to get a neutral second opinion.  \n\nWhen we are emotionally hung up, we need perspective.  \n\nSomeone not involved can help us see clearly.  \n\nThey can give us permission to stop forcing things.  \n\nI once wasted months trying to force a project.  \n\nIt just wasn’t working out.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Admitting failure allows us to move forward and avoid wasting time on mismatched commitments."
