  "text": "It all began while he studied to be a barrister in England.  \n\nHe came from a wealthy family with good prospects.  \n\nThe future looked bright for him.  \n\nEvery day he woke up with certainty.  \n\nHe was clear on his main objective.  \n\nHe wanted to prepare to be a professional in law.  \n\nThen he took the opportunity to travel the world.  \n\nEverything changed during his journey.  \n\nMohandas K. Gandhi went to South Africa.  \n\nHe saw oppression there.  \n\nSuddenly, he found a higher purpose.  \n\nHis purpose was the liberation of the oppressed everywhere.  \n\nWith this new purpose, he eliminated everything else from his life.  \n\nHe called this process “reducing himself to zero.”  \n\nHe dressed in his own homespun cloth, khadi.  \n\nHe inspired his followers to do the same.  \n\nHe spent three years not reading any newspapers.  \n\nHe found that newspapers added confusion to his life.  \n\nHe spent thirty-five years simplifying his diet.  \n\nHe spent a day each week without speaking.  \n\nIt is an understatement to say he eschewed consumerism.  \n\nWhen he died, he owned fewer than ten items.  \n\nMore importantly, he devoted his life to helping India gain independence.  \n\nHe never held a political position of any kind.  \n\nYet he became, officially, the “Father of the Nation” in India.  \n\nHis contribution extended well beyond India.  \n\nGeneral George C. Marshall said this on the occasion of his passing.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Gandhi transformed his life by eliminating distractions and dedicating himself to the liberation of the oppressed, embodying the essence of essentialism."
