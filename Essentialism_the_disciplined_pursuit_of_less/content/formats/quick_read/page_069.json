  "text": "Governor Brown will address the faculty on Thursday.  \n\nNext Thursday, the high school faculty will meet.  \n\nSimms reviewed the students’ leads and put them aside.  \n\nHe then informed them that they were all wrong.  \n\nThe lead to the story, he said, was, “There will be no school Thursday.”  \n\n“In that instant,” Ephron recalls, “I realized that journalism was not just about regurgitating the facts but about figuring out the point.”  \n\nIt wasn’t enough to know the who, what, when, and where.  \n\nYou had to understand what it meant.  \n\nAnd why it mattered.  \n\nEphron added, “He taught me something that works just as well in life as it does in journalism.”  \n\nIn every set of facts, something essential is hidden.  \n\nA good journalist knows that finding it involves exploring those pieces of information.  \n\nThey figure out the relationships between them.  \n\nMy undergraduate degree was in journalism, so I take this seriously.  \n\nIt means making those relationships and connections explicit.  \n\nIt means constructing the whole from the sum of its parts.  \n\nYou must understand how these different pieces come together.  \n\nThey must matter to anyone.  \n\nThe best journalists do not simply relay information.  \n\nTheir value is in discovering what really matters to people.  \n\nHave you ever felt lost and unsure about what to focus on?  \n\nHave you ever felt overwhelmed by all of the information bombarding you?  \n\nHave you ever felt dizzy from the different requests coming at you?  \n\nWere you unable to figure out which are important and which are not?  \n\nHave you ever missed the point to something in your work or at home?  \n\nDid you not realize your mistake until it was too late?  \n\nIf so, this next Essentialist skill will be immensely valuable.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Good journalism involves uncovering the essential meaning behind facts, helping people focus on what truly matters amidst overwhelming information."
