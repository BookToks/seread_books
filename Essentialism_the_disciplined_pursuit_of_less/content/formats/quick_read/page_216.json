  "text": "DEBATE UNTIL YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED A REALLY CLEAR ESSENTIAL INTENT\n\nWithout clarity of purpose, Nonessentialist leaders struggle with strategy.  \n\nThey try to pursue too many objectives and do too many things.  \n\nAs a result, their teams get spread in a million directions.  \n\nThey make little progress on any objective.  \n\nThey waste time on nonessentials.  \n\nThey neglect the things that really matter.  \n\nThere is a lot of talk about \"alignment\" in organizations.  \n\nThe more a team is aligned, the greater their contribution will be.  \n\nClear intent leads to alignment.  \n\nVague direction produces misalignment every time.  \n\nGO FOR EXTREME EMPOWERMENT\n\nThe Nonessentialist disempowers people with ambiguity over responsibilities.  \n\nThis is often justified as wanting to be flexible or agile.  \n\nWhat is created is counterfeit agility.  \n\nWhen people don’t know their responsibilities, they feel lost.  \n\nWhen decisions seem capricious, people become frustrated.  \n\nWhen roles are ill-defined, people give up or pretend to be busy.  \n\nAn Essentialist understands that clarity is key to empowerment.  \n\nHe does not allow roles to be general and vague.  \n\nHe ensures everyone is clear about their contributions.  \n\nEveryone also needs to know what others are contributing.  \n\nOne CEO admitted that ambiguity held his organization back.  \n\nTo repair the damage, he streamlined his executive team.  \n\nHe reduced it to just four direct reports.  \n\nEach had a clear functional responsibility across the organization.  \n\nPeter Thiel took “less but better” to an unorthodox level at PayPal.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Nonessentialist leaders create misalignment and hinder progress by pursuing too many objectives, while Essentialist leaders foster clarity and empowerment to enhance team contribution."
