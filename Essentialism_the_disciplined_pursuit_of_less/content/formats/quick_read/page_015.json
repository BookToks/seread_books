  "text": "That experience gave me renewed interest.\n\nI became obsessed with understanding choices people make.\n\n“Why do we have more ability than we utilize?” I wondered.\n\n“How can we make choices to tap into our potential?”\n\nMy mission led me to quit law school in England.\n\nI traveled to California for graduate work at Stanford.\n\nI spent over two years collaborating on a book.\n\nThe book is titled, Multipliers: How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smarter.\n\nIt inspired me to start a strategy and leadership company.\n\nI work with capable people in interesting companies.\n\nI help set them on the path of the Essentialist.\n\nI have seen people overwhelmed by pressures everywhere.\n\nI have coached successful people in quiet pain.\n\nThey try desperately to do everything perfectly now.\n\nI have seen people trapped by controlling managers.\n\nThey do not realize they do not have to do busywork.\n\nI have worked tirelessly to understand this phenomenon.\n\nMany bright individuals remain snared in the nonessential.\n\nWhat I found has surprised me.\n\nI worked with a driven executive who loved technology.\n\nHe got into technology at a young age.\n\nHe was rewarded for his knowledge and passion.\n\nHe continued to read and pursue opportunities eagerly.\n\nBy the time I met him, he was hyperactive.\n\nHe tried to learn everything and do it all.\n\nHe found a new obsession every day, sometimes every hour.\n\nIn the process, he lost the ability to discern vital from trivial.\n\nEverything felt important to him.\n\nAs a result, he became stretched thinner and thinner.\n\nHe made a millimeter of progress in a million directions.\n\nHe was overworked and underutilized.\n\nThat’s when I sketched an image for him.\n\nHe stared at it in uncharacteristic silence for a long time.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The author explores why intelligent individuals often fail to utilize their full potential and how to make choices that enable them to do so."
