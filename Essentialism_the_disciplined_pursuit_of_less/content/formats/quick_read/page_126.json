  "text": "to have a VERY BIG waste paper basket to take care of ALL invitations. \n\nProductivity, in my experience, consists of NOT doing anything that helps others. \n\nIt involves spending all one’s time on the work the Good Lord has fitted one to do. \n\nA true Essentialist, Peter Drucker, believed that “people are effective because they say no.” \n\nNonessentialists say yes due to feelings of social awkwardness and pressure. \n\nThey say yes automatically, without thinking, often to feel the rush of pleasing someone. \n\nBut Essentialists know that the rush is followed by the pang of regret. \n\nThey realize they will soon feel bullied and resentful. \n\nThis resentment is directed at both the other person and themselves. \n\nEventually, they wake up to the reality that something important must be sacrificed. \n\nThe point is not to say no to all requests. \n\nThe point is to say no to nonessentials. \n\nThis allows us to say yes to things that really matter. \n\nIt is about saying no—frequently and gracefully—to everything but what is vital. \n\nNonessentialists avoid saying no to avoid feeling social awkwardness and pressure. \n\nThey say yes to everything. \n\nEssentialists dare to say no firmly, resolutely, and gracefully. \n\nThey say yes only to things that truly matter. \n\nSo how do we learn to say no gracefully? \n\nBelow are general guidelines followed by specific scripts for delivering a graceful “no.” \n\nSEPARATE THE DECISION FROM THE RELATIONSHIP. \n\nWhen people ask us to do something, we can confuse the request with our relationship. \n\nSometimes they seem interconnected, and we forget denying the request is not denying the person. \n\nOnly once we separate the decision from the relationship can we make a clear decision. \n\nThen we can find the courage and compassion to respond.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialists prioritize saying no to nonessentials in order to focus on what truly matters."
