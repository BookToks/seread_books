  "text": "Seven students were asked how long their thesis would take.  \n\nThey estimated 27.4 days if everything went perfectly.  \n\nThey estimated 48.6 days if everything went poorly.  \n\nThe average time taken was 55.5 days.  \n\nOnly 30 percent completed it within their estimated time.  \n\nPeople often underestimate time but believe their estimates are accurate.  \n\nSocial pressure is a key reason for underestimating time.  \n\nOne study showed anonymous estimates reduce the planning fallacy.  \n\nThis suggests we know we can't meet time frames.  \n\nYet, we avoid admitting it to others.  \n\nAs a result, we are often late.  \n\nWe arrive late to meetings and deliverables.  \n\nWe pay bills later than we promise.  \n\nExecution becomes frustrating instead of smooth.  \n\nOne way to protect against this is to add a buffer.  \n\nAdd a 50 percent buffer to your time estimates.  \n\nIf you expect a task to take an hour, block off 90 minutes.  \n\nIf you estimate ten minutes for a drive, leave 15 minutes early.  \n\nThis reduces stress about being late.  \n\nSitting in traffic is less stressful if you're not running late.  \n\nIf a task is quicker than expected, the extra time feels like a bonus.  \n\nErwann Michel-Kerjan recommends conducting scenario planning.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** People tend to underestimate the time required to complete tasks due to social pressure and the planning fallacy, leading to frequent delays."
