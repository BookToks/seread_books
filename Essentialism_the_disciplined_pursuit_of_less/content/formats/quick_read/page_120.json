  "text": "Living with intent is important. \n\nEssential intent goes beyond your job description. \n\nIt relates to your company’s mission statement too. \n\nTrue essential intent guides your purpose. \n\nIt helps you chart your life’s path. \n\nFor example, Nelson Mandela spent twenty-seven years in jail. \n\nHe became an Essentialist during this time. \n\nWhen jailed in 1962, he lost almost everything. \n\nHe lost his home, reputation, pride, and freedom. \n\nHe chose to focus on what was essential. \n\nHe eliminated everything else, including his resentment. \n\nHis essential intent was to eliminate apartheid. \n\nHe established a legacy that lives on today. \n\nCreating an essential intent is hard work. \n\nIt requires courage, insight, and foresight. \n\nYou must see which activities matter most. \n\nYou need to identify your highest contribution. \n\nThis involves asking tough questions. \n\nIt requires making real trade-offs. \n\nYou must exercise discipline to cut distractions. \n\nThese distractions compete with your true intention. \n\nThe effort is worth it. \n\nWith clarity of purpose, people can mobilize. \n\nTeams and organizations can achieve excellence.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essential intent is a guiding principle that helps individuals focus on their true purpose and eliminate distractions to achieve excellence."
