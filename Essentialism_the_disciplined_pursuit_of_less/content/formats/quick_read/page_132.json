  "text": "CHAPTER 12\n\nUNCOMMIT\n\nWin Big by Cutting Your Losses\n\nHalf of the troubles of this life can be traced to saying yes too quickly and not saying no soon enough.\n\n—Josh Billings\n\nThe Concorde jet was a striking achievement in aeronautical engineering. \n\nYou could fly from London to New York in two hours, fifty-two minutes, and fifty-nine seconds. \n\nThat’s less than half the time of a traditional plane. \n\nThe Concorde was the fastest passenger plane in the world. \n\nUnfortunately, it was also an extraordinary financial failure. \n\nMany great ideas and products are financial failures. \n\nWhat made this one different was its consistent losses for more than four decades. \n\nEach time it went over budget, the French and British governments invested more money. \n\nThey did this knowing the chance of recouping their investments was minuscule. \n\nWith limited seating and few orders, profitability was unlikely. \n\nEven with exaggerated estimates, the project would never be profitable. \n\nWhen British cabinet papers were released, they revealed government ministers knew the investment “could not stand on normal economic grounds.” \n\nWhy would intelligent government officials continue to invest in a losing proposition? \n\nOne reason is a common psychological phenomenon called “sunk-cost bias.” \n\nSunk-cost bias is the tendency to continue investing time, money, or resources.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The Concorde jet exemplifies how sunk-cost bias can lead to continued investment in a failing project despite clear evidence of its financial impracticality."
