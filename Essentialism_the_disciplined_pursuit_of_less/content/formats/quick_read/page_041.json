  "text": "William James once wrote, “My first act of free will shall be to believe in free will.”  \n\nThat is why the first skill you will learn is choice.  \n\nYou must develop your ability to choose in every area of life.  \n\nNonessentialists say, “I have to.”  \n\nThis forfeits the right to choose.  \n\nEssentialists say, “I choose to.”  \n\nThis exercises the power of choice.  \n\nWhen we forget our ability to choose, we learn helplessness.  \n\nDrip by drip, we allow our power to be taken away.  \n\nWe become a function of other people’s choices.  \n\nWe may even become a function of our own past choices.  \n\nIn turn, we surrender our power to choose.  \n\nThat is the path of the Nonessentialist.  \n\nThe Essentialist recognizes the power of choice.  \n\nHe celebrates it.  \n\nThe Essentialist knows that surrendering our right to choose gives others power.  \n\nWe also give others explicit permission to choose for us.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The key skill in life is to recognize and exercise the power of choice, as surrendering it leads to helplessness and allows others to dictate our decisions."
