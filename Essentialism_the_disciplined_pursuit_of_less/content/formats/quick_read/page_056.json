  "text": "In a piece called “Laugh, Kookaburra,” David Sedaris shares a story. \n\nHe describes his experience touring the Australian bush. \n\nWhile hiking, his friend shares something from a management class. \n\nShe says to imagine a four-burner stove. \n\nOne burner represents your family. \n\nAnother burner represents your friends. \n\nThe third burner represents your health. \n\nThe last burner represents your work. \n\nYou can only keep a few burners on at once. \n\nIf you turn one burner on high, others must turn down. \n\nYou cannot have all four burners on high. \n\nThis idea illustrates the trade-offs we face in life. \n\nYou must choose where to focus your energy. \n\nIt is important to recognize these choices. \n\nYou cannot do everything at once. \n\nUnderstanding this helps you prioritize what matters most. \n\nLife requires us to make decisions about our time. \n\nWe must decide what to turn down or off. \n\nThis process is essential for living a fulfilling life.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialists explore and evaluate a wide range of options before making commitments, unlike Nonessentialists who react to everything and end up exploring less."
