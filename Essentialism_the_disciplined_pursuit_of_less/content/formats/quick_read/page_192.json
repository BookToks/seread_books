  "text": "Think about how this might apply in your own life.  \n\nHave you ever become trapped reliving past mistakes?  \n\nIt’s like a video player stuck on endless replay.  \n\nDo you spend time and energy worrying about the future?  \n\nDo you think more about things you can’t control?  \n\nRather than focusing on what you can control?  \n\nDo you find yourself busy preparing for the next meeting?  \n\nOr the next assignment or the next chapter in your life?  \n\nInstead of being fully present in the current one?  \n\nIt’s natural to obsess over past mistakes.  \n\nIt’s also common to feel stress about what may come.  \n\nYet every second spent worrying distracts us from now.  \n\nThe ancient Greeks had two words for time.  \n\nThe first was chronos.  \n\nThe second was kairos.  \n\nThe Greek god Chronos was imagined as an elderly man.  \n\nHis name connotes the literal ticking clock.  \n\nIt refers to chronological time we measure.  \n\nKairos is different.  \n\nIt refers to time that is opportune and right.  \n\nChronos is quantitative; kairos is qualitative.  \n\nKairos is experienced only when we are fully in the moment.  \n\nWe only ever have now.  \n\nWe can’t control the future in a literal sense.  \n\nWe can only control the now.  \n\nOf course, we learn from the past.  \n\nWe can imagine the future.  \n\nYet we can only execute in the here and now.  \n\nNonessentialists focus on past successes and failures.  \n\nThey also think about future challenges and opportunities.  \n\nThey miss the present moment.  \n\nThey become distracted and unfocused.  \n\nThey aren’t really there.  \n\nThe way of the Essentialist is to tune into the present.  \n\nTo experience life in kairos, not just chronos.  \n\nTo focus on what is truly important.  \n\nNot yesterday or tomorrow, but right now.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Focusing on the present moment is essential for effectively engaging with what truly matters in life."
