  "text": "On a bright, winter day in California, I visited my wife, Anna, in the hospital. \n\nEven in the hospital, Anna was radiant. \n\nBut I also knew she was exhausted. \n\nIt was the day after our precious daughter was born. \n\nShe was healthy and happy at 7 pounds, 3 ounces. \n\nYet what should have been one of the happiest days was filled with tension. \n\nEven as my beautiful new baby lay in my wife’s tired arms, I was on the phone and on email with work. \n\nI felt pressure to go to a client meeting. \n\nMy colleague had written, “Friday between 1–2 would be a bad time to have a baby because I need you to come be at this meeting with X.” \n\nIt was now Friday. \n\nI was pretty certain the email had been written in jest. \n\nStill, I felt pressure to attend. \n\nInstinctively, I knew what to do. \n\nIt was clearly a time to be there for my wife and newborn child. \n\nSo when asked whether I planned to attend the meeting, I said with all the conviction I could muster… \n\n“Yes.” \n\nTo my shame, while my wife lay in the hospital with our hours-old baby, I went to the meeting. \n\nAfterward, my colleague said, “The client will respect you for making the decision to be here.” \n\nBut the look on the clients’ faces did not show respect. \n\nInstead, they mirrored how I felt. \n\nWhat was I doing there? \n\nI had said “yes” simply to please. \n\nIn doing so, I had hurt my family, my integrity, and even the client relationship. \n\nAs it turned out, exactly nothing came of the client meeting. \n\nBut even if it had, I would have made a fool’s bargain. \n\nIn trying to keep everyone happy, I had sacrificed what mattered most. \n\nOn reflection, I discovered this important lesson: \n\nIf you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** If you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will."
