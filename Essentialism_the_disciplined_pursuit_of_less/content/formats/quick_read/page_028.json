  "text": "Many of us say yes to things.  \n\nWe are eager to please and make a difference.  \n\nYet the key to our highest contribution may be saying no.  \n\nAs Peter Drucker said, “People are effective because they say ‘no.’”  \n\nEliminating nonessentials means saying no to someone.  \n\nIt often means pushing against social expectations.  \n\nTo do it well takes courage and compassion.  \n\nEliminating nonessentials isn’t just about mental discipline.  \n\nIt’s about the emotional discipline to say no.  \n\nWe face social pressure when we say no.  \n\nThis section of the book addresses this challenging dynamic.  \n\nGiven the reality of trade-offs, we can’t do everything.  \n\nThe real question is who will choose what we do.  \n\nWhen we forfeit our right to choose, others will choose for us.  \n\nWe can deliberately choose what not to do.  \n\nOr we can be pulled in unwanted directions.  \n\nThis section offers a method for eliminating nonessentials.  \n\nThis method earns us time to achieve what is essential.  \n\nOnly then can we build a platform for effortless execution.  \n\nThis is the subject of step 3.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Eliminating nonessentials requires the courage to say no, allowing us to focus on what truly matters and make our highest contributions."
