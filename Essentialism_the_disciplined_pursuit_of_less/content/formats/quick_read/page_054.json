  "text": "Jim chose ideas.  \n\nHe built great ideas but not both.  \n\nAs a result, his company has three full-time employees.  \n\nHis ideas reached tens of millions through his writing.  \n\nTrade-offs can be painful.  \n\nThey represent a significant opportunity.  \n\nThey force us to weigh both options.  \n\nWe can strategically select the best one for us.  \n\nThis increases our chance of achieving our desired outcome.  \n\nLike Southwest, we can enjoy success from consistent choices.  \n\nI saw this on a recent flight to Boston.  \n\nI chatted with two parents visiting their son at Harvard.  \n\nThey were proud their son was there.  \n\nI was curious about their strategy for his acceptance.  \n\nThey said, “We had him try a lot of different things.”  \n\nThey took him out of activities that weren’t his ‘big thing.’  \n\nThe point is not that all parents should want Harvard.  \n\nThese Essentialist parents had a clear goal for their son.  \n\nThey understood success required strategic trade-offs.  \n\nThis logic applies to our personal lives too.  \n\nWhen newlyweds, Anna and I met a couple with an amazing marriage.  \n\nWe wanted to learn their secret.  \n\nHe said they decided not to join any clubs.  \n\nHe didn’t join the local lodge.  \n\nShe didn’t join book clubs.  \n\nThey had interest in those things.  \n\nThey made the trade-off to spend time with their children.  \n\nTheir children became their best friends.  \n\nThis was worth sacrificing friendships on the golf course.  \n\nEssentialists see trade-offs as part of life.  \n\nThey don’t see them as negative.  \n\nInstead of asking, “What do I have to give up?”  \n\nThey ask, “What do I want to go big on?”  \n\nThis small change in thinking can have a profound impact.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialists view trade-offs as opportunities for strategic decision-making to achieve their desired outcomes."
