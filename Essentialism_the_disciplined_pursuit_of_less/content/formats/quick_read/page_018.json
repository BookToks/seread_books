  "text": "Several trends have combined to create a perfect Nonessentialist storm.  \n\nConsider the following.  \n\nWe have all observed the exponential increase in choices.  \n\nThis increase has happened over the last decade.  \n\nYet, we have lost sight of the most important choices.  \n\nPeter Drucker said something important about this.  \n\nHe stated that, in a few hundred years,  \n\nhistorians will see significant events from our time.  \n\nThey will not focus on technology or the Internet.  \n\nThey will not focus on e-commerce either.  \n\nInstead, they will see a change in the human condition.  \n\nFor the first time, many people have choices.  \n\nFor the first time, they must manage themselves.  \n\nSociety is totally unprepared for this change.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The overwhelming increase in choices has led to a loss of focus on what is truly important, creating a pervasive culture of Nonessentialism."
