  "text": "Being selective is important when choosing opportunities.  \n\nIt becomes harder when opportunities come to us.  \n\nWe may get a job offer we didn’t expect.  \n\nA side project might offer easy cash, but isn’t our focus.  \n\nSomeone may ask us to help with unpaid work we love.  \n\nAn acquaintance might offer a timeshare at a discounted rate.  \n\nWhat do we do in these situations?  \n\nThe fear of missing out kicks in.  \n\nHow can we say no when the offer is right here?  \n\nWe might not have pursued it, but it’s easy to consider.  \n\nIf we say yes for an easy reward, we risk missing out.  \n\nWe may later have to say no to something more meaningful.  \n\nNancy Duarte faced this challenge while building her agency.  \n\nIn 2000, her company was a generalist agency.  \n\nThey created corporate identities, print, and websites.  \n\nThey also designed presentations, which many firms disliked.  \n\nWithout a specialty, they became like any other design agency.  \n\nThen Nancy read Jim Collins’s *Good to Great*.  \n\nHe argued that we should focus on what we are passionate about.  \n\nWe should do the one thing we can be best at.  \n\nNancy realized the opportunity was in designing presentations.  \n\nNo one else in the industry wanted to do that work.  \n\nBy focusing on this niche, they could become the best.  \n\nThey would build the knowledge and expertise needed.  \n\nBut to succeed, they had to say no to everything else.  \n\nThis included turning down paid work during tough times.  \n\nIt was the price of becoming distinct.  \n\nThey needed to be selective in the work they accepted.  \n\nThis would help them excel in their specialty.  \n\nHere’s a simple process to apply selective criteria.  \n\nFirst, write down the opportunities that come your way.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Being selective about opportunities is crucial to avoid diluting focus and to excel in a chosen specialty."
