  "text": "The value of play in our lives can’t be overstated.  \n\nStudies from the animal kingdom reveal play is crucial for development.  \n\nIt may even play a role in a species’ survival.  \n\nBob Fagan studied grizzly bear behavior for fifteen years.  \n\nHe discovered bears who played the most survived the longest.  \n\nWhen asked why, he said play prepares bears for challenges.  \n\nJaak Panksepp concluded something similar in Affective Neuroscience.  \n\nHe wrote animals behave flexibly and creatively during play.  \n\nStuart Brown writes humans are the biggest players of all.  \n\nWe are built to play and built through play.  \n\nWhen we play, we express our humanity and individuality.  \n\nIs it any wonder our best memories are moments of play?  \n\nPlay expands our minds and allows us to explore.  \n\nIt helps germinate new ideas and see old ideas differently.  \n\nPlay makes us more inquisitive and attuned to novelty.  \n\nIt is fundamental to living the Essentialist way.  \n\nPlay fuels exploration in at least three specific ways.  \n\nFirst, play broadens our range of options.  \n\nIt helps us see possibilities we wouldn’t have seen.  \n\nIt allows us to make connections we wouldn’t have made.  \n\nPlay opens our minds and broadens our perspective.  \n\nIt helps us challenge old assumptions.  \n\nIt makes us receptive to untested ideas.  \n\nPlay gives us permission to expand our consciousness.  \n\nIt helps us come up with new stories.  \n\nAlbert Einstein said fantasy meant more to him than knowledge.  \n\nSecond, play is an antidote to stress.  \n\nThis is key because stress is an enemy of productivity.  \n\nStress can actually shut down our cognitive functions.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Play is essential for cognitive development and exploration, enhancing creativity and reducing stress."
