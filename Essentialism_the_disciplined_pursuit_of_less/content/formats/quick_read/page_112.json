  "text": "Executives often say their company purpose is \"pretty clear.\"  \n\nThey think that is sufficient.  \n\nBut there is a big difference between pretty clear and really clear!  \n\nThis difference also applies to individualsâ€™ professional strategy.  \n\nWhen I ask people what they really want from their career,  \n\nI am surprised by how few can answer.  \n\nThis matters because clarity of purpose predicts job performance.  \n\nI have seen what happens when teams are only \"sort of clear.\"  \n\nThey struggle with motivation and cooperation.  \n\nLack of purpose deteriorates team dynamics.  \n\nYou can train leaders on communication and teamwork.  \n\nYou can conduct 360 feedback reports endlessly.  \n\nBut without clarity of goals and roles, problems will multiply.  \n\nThis is not just my theory.  \n\nI gathered data from over five hundred people.  \n\nThey shared experiences from more than one thousand teams.  \n\nI found a consistent reality:  \n\nA serious lack of clarity leads to confusion.  \n\nPeople experience stress and frustration without clarity.  \n\nOn the other hand, high clarity helps people thrive.  \n\nWithout clarity, people waste time on trivial matters.  \n\nWith sufficient clarity, they achieve greater breakthroughs.  \n\nThey innovate in truly vital areas.  \n\nIn my work, I notice two common patterns when teams lack clarity.  \n\nThe first pattern is playing politics.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Clarity of purpose significantly enhances motivation and cooperation within teams, while a lack of it leads to confusion and inefficiency."
