  "text": "Instead of starting big and then flaring out, \n\nwe need to start small and build momentum. \n\nThen we can use that momentum to work toward the next win. \n\nWe can keep going until we have a significant breakthrough. \n\nWhen we do, our progress will feel frictionless and effortless. \n\nThe breakthrough will seem like overnight success. \n\nFormer Stanford professor Henry B. Eyring wrote about improvement. \n\nHe said the best place to look is for small changes. \n\nThese changes should be in the things we do often. \n\nThere is power in steadiness and repetition. \n\nWhen I met Dr. Phil Zimbardo for lunch, \n\nI knew him primarily as the mastermind of the Stanford prison experiment. \n\nIn the summer of 1971, Zimbardo took healthy Stanford students. \n\nHe assigned them roles as either \"guards\" or \"inmates.\" \n\nThen he locked them in a makeshift prison.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To achieve significant breakthroughs, we should start small to build momentum, leading to effortless progress over time."
