  "text": "We know we cannot explore every piece of information.\n\nDiscerning what is essential requires discipline.\n\nWe must scan and filter competing facts and opinions.\n\nRecently, I spoke with Thomas Friedman, a journalist.\n\nWe discussed how to filter essential information from noise.\n\nBefore our meeting, he attended a lunch with sources.\n\nSomeone thought he was not paying attention.\n\nBut he was listening to the whole conversation.\n\nHe filtered out everything except what grabbed his attention.\n\nHe asked questions about what piqued his interest.\n\nThe best journalists listen for what others do not hear.\n\nAt lunch, Friedman listened for what was said at the periphery.\n\nHe focused more on what was not being said.\n\nEssentialists are powerful observers and listeners.\n\nThey know they cannot pay attention to everything.\n\nThey listen deliberately for what is not explicitly stated.\n\nThey read between the lines.\n\nHermione Granger once said she is highly logical.\n\nThis allows her to see what others overlook.\n\nNonessentialists listen too, but they prepare to speak.\n\nThey get distracted by extraneous noise.\n\nThey hyperfocus on inconsequential details.\n\nThey hear the loudest voice but miss the message.\n\nIn their eagerness to react, they miss the point.\n\nThey may run around with fire extinguishers during a flood.\n\nThey miss the lead.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Discerning essential information from nonessential noise requires disciplined observation and listening skills."
