  "text": "Companies allow employees to come in late after working late.  \n\nThese companies know that protecting their assets is important.  \n\nI recently visited Google to nap in one of their pods.  \n\nThe pod looked like a white spaceship from a TV show.  \n\nIt was about twenty square feet in size.  \n\nI could lie down but not completely flat.  \n\nIt had a dome-shaped cover that concealed most of my body.  \n\nI felt a little self-conscious at first.  \n\nI wondered if I could fall asleep.  \n\nThirty minutes later, the pod vibrated gently.  \n\nI didnâ€™t have to wonder anymore.  \n\nWhen I woke up, I felt how much I needed it.  \n\nI felt clearer, sharper, and more alert.  \n\nTo use the pods at Google, there is a sign-up calendar.  \n\nI wondered how many people used it that week.  \n\nOf the fifty people on that floor, I imagined ten or twenty.  \n\nI was wrong.  \n\nAccording to the calendar, only one person had used it.  \n\nThat person recharged with thirty minutes of midday sleep.  \n\nEven the presence of the pod signals that sleep is a priority.  \n\nOur highest priority is to protect our ability to prioritize.  \n\nIn this section, we discuss exploring and evaluating options.  \n\nThis helps us discern the essential few from the many trivial things.  \n\nBy definition, this is a process of prioritization.  \n\nIt includes filtering options that seem good at first.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Companies like Google emphasize the importance of sleep to enhance employee productivity and prioritization."
