  "text": "The Best Slice of Pizza in Brooklyn\n\nApplying tougher criteria helps us make better decisions.\n\nIt allows us to use our brain's search engine.\n\nThink of it like searching for \"best slice of pizza.\"\n\nSearching for \"a good career opportunity\" gives many options.\n\nInstead, ask three questions for an advanced search.\n\nWhat am I deeply passionate about?\n\nWhat taps my talent?\n\nWhat meets a significant need in the world?\n\nThere won’t be as many pages to view.\n\nThat is the point of the exercise.\n\nWe aren't looking for many good things to do.\n\nWe want the one where we can contribute the most.\n\nEnric Sala found his life’s calling this way.\n\nEarly in his career, Enric was a professor.\n\nHe worked at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.\n\nHe felt he was on the wrong career path.\n\nSo he left academia for National Geographic.\n\nWith that success came new opportunities in Washington, D.C.\n\nHe felt close to the right path but not quite there.\n\nHis earlier success distracted him from his purpose.\n\nHe dreamed of diving in beautiful oceans.\n\nHe watched Jacques Cousteau aboard the Calypso.\n\nAfter a couple of years, a golden opportunity arose.\n\nHe changed gears to make his highest contribution.\n\nHe became an explorer-in-residence with National Geographic.\n\nHe spent time diving in remote locations.\n\nHe used his strengths in science and communications.\n\nHe influenced policy on a global scale.\n\nThe price of his dream job was saying no.\n\nHe turned down many good opportunities.\n\nHe waited for the one he could enthusiastically say yes to.\n\nThe wait was worth it.\n\nEnric is a rare example of someone doing work he loves.\n\nHis work taps his talent and serves an important need.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Applying stricter criteria to major life decisions helps individuals identify and pursue their highest contributions."
