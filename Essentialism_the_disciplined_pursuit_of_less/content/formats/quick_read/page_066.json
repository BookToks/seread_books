  "text": "We can take inspiration from CEO Bill Gates. \n\nHe regularly takes a week off from Microsoft. \n\nHe uses this time to think and read. \n\nI once attended a session with Bill in Seattle. \n\nHe had just completed his latest “Think Week.” \n\nThis practice goes back to the 1980s. \n\nHe maintained it during Microsoft’s expansion. \n\nTwice a year, he creates time for this. \n\nHe secludes himself for a week to read. \n\nHe reads articles and books. \n\nHis record for reading is 112 articles. \n\nHe studies technology and thinks about the bigger picture. \n\nToday, he still takes time away from distractions. \n\nHe uses this time to simply think. \n\nIf a full week seems overwhelming, consider alternatives. \n\nYou can incorporate a “Think Week” into your day. \n\nOne useful practice is reading classic literature. \n\nRead for the first twenty minutes of the day. \n\nThis helps prevent checking email upon waking. \n\nIt centers your day and broadens your perspective. \n\nIt reminds you of timeless themes and ideas. \n\nI prefer inspirational literature, but it’s personal. \n\nHere are some suggestions to consider: \n\nZen, the Reason of Unreason. \n\nThe Wisdom of Confucius. \n\nThe Torah. \n\nThe Holy Bible. \n\nTao, to Know and Not Be Knowing. \n\nThe Meaning of the Glorious Koran: An Explanatory Translation. \n\nAs a Man Thinketh. \n\nThe Essential Gandhi. \n\nWalden, or, Life in the Woods. \n\nThe Book of Mormon. \n\nThe Meditations of Marcus Aurelius. \n\nThe Upanishads. \n\nThere are many options available. \n\nChoose something written before our hyperconnected era. \n\nSuch writings challenge our assumptions about what matters. \n\nYou can invest two hours a day or two weeks a year.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Creating dedicated time for reflection and reading, as exemplified by Bill Gates' \"Think Week,\" can enhance focus and broaden perspective amidst daily distractions."
