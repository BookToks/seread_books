  "text": "Good behavior includes throwing litter in a bin.\n\nIt also means wearing a helmet while biking.\n\nSkateboarding in designated areas is another example.\n\nGetting to school on time is important too.\n\nOfficers would give tickets for positive behavior.\n\nThese tickets wouldn’t carry fines like parking tickets.\n\nInstead, they would be redeemable for small rewards.\n\nRewards might include free entry to movies or events.\n\nThese activities keep young people off the streets.\n\nRichmond’s effort to reimagine policing worked well.\n\nIt took time, but they invested in this strategy.\n\nAfter a decade, the Positive Tickets system succeeded.\n\nRecidivism dropped from 60 percent to 8 percent.\n\nYou might not expect Essentialism in a police department.\n\nWard’s Positive Tickets system shows effortless execution.\n\nNonessentialists try to do everything at once.\n\nThey believe more effort leads to more achievement.\n\nHowever, reaching for too much makes progress harder.\n\nEssentialists take a different approach.\n\nThey start small and celebrate progress.\n\nThey avoid flashy wins that don’t matter.\n\nInstead, they pursue small, simple wins in essential areas.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Richmond's Positive Tickets system effectively reduced recidivism by celebrating small acts of positive behavior rather than focusing solely on punitive measures."
