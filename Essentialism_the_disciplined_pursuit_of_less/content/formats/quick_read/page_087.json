  "text": "Protecting the Asset  \n\nThe best asset we have is ourselves.  \n\nIf we underinvest in ourselves, we damage our ability to contribute.  \n\nThis includes our minds, bodies, and spirits.  \n\nA common way people damage this asset is through lack of sleep.  \n\nIf we let our type A instincts take over, we burn out.  \n\nWe need to be strategic with ourselves, like with our careers.  \n\nWe must pace ourselves and nurture our well-being.  \n\nWe need fuel to explore, thrive, and perform.  \n\nGeoff spent many hours resting.  \n\nHe saw an interesting paradox in his addiction to achievement.  \n\nFor a type A personality, pushing hard is easy.  \n\nThe real challenge is not working hard.  \n\nHe tells overachievers to say no to an opportunity.  \n\nThis allows time to take a nap.  \n\nBy twenty-one, I thought sleep was to be avoided.  \n\nTo me, sleep was a necessary evil.  \n\nIt felt like a waste of time.  \n\nI saw it as something for the weak.  \n\nThe idea of being superhuman was intoxicating.  \n\nI experimented with drastic ways to cut down on sleep.  \n\nAfter reading a sleep study, I tried a new schedule.  \n\nParticipants slept only twenty minutes every four hours.  \n\nIt was bearable for a while.  \n\nBut I found it had drawbacks.  \n\nWhile awake, my brain barely functioned.  \n\nIt was harder to think, plan, and prioritize.  \n\nI struggled to make decisions.  \n\nI could not discern the essential from the trivial.  \n\nThis schedule soon became unsustainable.  \n\nStill, I believed less sleep meant more productivity.  \n\nI adopted a new tactic of pulling all-nighters.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Investing in our well-being, particularly through adequate sleep, is crucial for maximizing our contributions to the world."
