  "text": "The value of creating space to explore is important to me. \n\nI learned this in my work with the d.school at Stanford. \n\nThe first thing I noticed was the lack of traditional chairs. \n\nInstead, there are foam cubes to sit on. \n\nThey are uncomfortable, as I soon discovered. \n\nLike almost everything at the d.school, this is by design. \n\nThe cubes encourage students to stand up and walk around. \n\nThey engage with one another, not just their neighbors. \n\nThat is the point of the design. \n\nThe school uses physical space to encourage new ways of thinking. \n\nThey also created a hiding place called “Booth Noir.” \n\nThis small room fits only one to three people. \n\nIt is windowless and soundproof. \n\nIt is free of distractions. \n\nAccording to Scott Doorley and Scott Witthoft, it is “beyond low-tech.” \n\nIt is tucked away on the ground floor. \n\nIt is not on the way to anywhere else. \n\nYou go there only to think. \n\nCreating space to think helps students see more clearly. \n\nThere is a false association with the word focus. \n\nPeople think of focus as a thing. \n\nYes, focus is something we have. \n\nBut focus is also something we do. \n\nTo have focus, we need to escape to focus. \n\nWhen I say focus, I don’t mean simply picking a question.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Creating intentional space for exploration and thinking enhances engagement and clarity in learning environments."
