  "text": "Their problem is not your problem.  \n\nSetting boundaries is a challenge.  \n\nThis challenge extends beyond the workplace.  \n\nSome people make demands on our time.  \n\nDo you feel your weekend is hijacked?  \n\nIs there someone who crosses the line?  \n\nWe all have people who are high maintenance.  \n\nThese people make their problem our problem.  \n\nThey distract us from our purpose.  \n\nThey care only about their own agendas.  \n\nThey prevent us from contributing our best.  \n\nThey siphon our time and energy away.  \n\nThey focus on what is essential to them.  \n\nWe must set boundaries to protect ourselves.  \n\nWe can learn from Jin-Yung and Clayton Christensen.  \n\nHere are some guidelines to consider.  \n\nDon’t rob people of their problems.  \n\nWe should help people when we can.  \n\nWe should serve, love, and make a difference.  \n\nBut enabling them isn’t helping them.  \n\nTaking their problem takes away their ability to solve it.  \n\nHenry Cloud tells a story about this.  \n\nParents sought help for their twenty-five-year-old son.  \n\nThey wanted him “fixed.”  \n\nHenry asked why they came without him.  \n\nThey said he doesn’t think he has a problem.  \n\nAfter listening, Henry surprised them.  \n\nHe said, “I think your son is right.  \n\nHe doesn’t have a problem. You do.”  \n\nThey pay, fret, worry, and plan for him.  \n\nHe doesn’t have a problem because they took it.  \n\nCloud offered a metaphor about a neighbor.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Setting boundaries is essential to prevent others from making their problems our own and to maintain focus on our own priorities."
