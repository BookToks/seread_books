K. Prahalad and their brilliant piece in \n\nHarvard Business Review, “Strategic Intent,” May 1989, \n\nhttp://hbr.org/1989/05/strategic-intent/ar/1. \n\nThey use as context the Japanese companies at the time who had a long-term intent to stretch companies to go beyond their current level of resources. \n\nOver time as I have worked with people and teams this idea has proven useful but has changed sufficiently enough to be described differently. \n\nThus an essential intent. \n\nJuan Williams, \n\nEyes on the Prize: America’s Civil Rights Years, 1954–1965 \n\n(New York: Penguin Books, 2002), 66. \n\nMark Feeney, “Rosa Parks, Civil Rights Icon, Dead at 92,” \n\nBoston Globe, October 25, 2005. \n\nDonnie Williams and Wayne Greenhaw, \n\nThe Thunder of Angels: The Montgomery Bus Boycott and the People who Broke the Back of Jim Crow \n\n(Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2005), 48. \n\n“Civil Rights Icon Rosa Parks Dies at 92,” CNN, October 25, 2005. \n\nThis story is shared in a few different places, but this account is taken from my interview with Cynthia Covey in 2012. \n\nStephen R. Covey and Roger and Rebecca Merrill, \n\nFirst Things First.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The chapter emphasizes the importance of clarifying one's essential intent to focus on what truly matters."
