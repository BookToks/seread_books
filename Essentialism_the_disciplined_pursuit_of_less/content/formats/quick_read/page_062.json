  "text": "Creating space to explore is important. \n\nIt allows for one hundred questions and possibilities. \n\nAn Essentialist focuses like our eyes do. \n\nThey adjust and adapt to their field of vision. \n\nIn a recent meeting at the d.school, \n\nI met with Jeremy Utley. \n\nHe is my partner in developing a new class. \n\nHe called it “Designing Life, Essentially.” \n\nThe class aims to create space for students. \n\nStudents design their lives during this time. \n\nEach week, they have time to think. \n\nThey must turn off laptops and smartphones. \n\nThey turn on the full power of their minds. \n\nAssignments help them discern the essential few. \n\nThey learn to separate the many good. \n\nYou don’t need to be at the d.school. \n\nWe can all learn to create more space. \n\nWe can create more space in our lives.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Creating space for exploration and focused thinking allows individuals to discern the essential from the non-essential in their lives."
