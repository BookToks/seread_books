  "text": "In the first pattern, the team focuses on winning the manager's attention.  \n\nThe problem is, people don’t know the end game.  \n\nThey are unclear about how to win.  \n\nAs a result, they make up their own game.  \n\nThey create their own rules to vie for the manager’s favor.  \n\nInstead of contributing, they focus on looking better than peers.  \n\nThey demonstrate self-importance and echo the manager’s ideas.  \n\nThese activities are nonessential, damaging, and counterproductive.  \n\nWe do this in our personal lives too.  \n\nWhen we lack clarity about our purpose, we make up social games.  \n\nWe waste time trying to look good compared to others.  \n\nWe overvalue nonessentials like nicer cars or houses.  \n\nWe also value intangibles like Twitter followers or Facebook photos.  \n\nAs a result, we neglect truly essential activities.  \n\nThese include spending time with loved ones.  \n\nThey also include nurturing our spirit and caring for our health.  \n\nIn the second pattern, teams without purpose become leaderless.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** When teams lack a clear purpose, they engage in counterproductive activities focused on gaining favor rather than making meaningful contributions."
