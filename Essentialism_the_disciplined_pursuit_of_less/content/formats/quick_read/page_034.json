  "text": "Essentialism is not a way to do one more thing.  \n\nIt is a different way of doing everything.  \n\nIt is a way of thinking.  \n\nBut internalizing this way of thinking is challenging.  \n\nCertain ideas pull us toward Nonessentialism.  \n\nPeople peddling those ideas reinforce this pull.  \n\nThis part of the book has three chapters.  \n\nEach chapter addresses a fallacy of Nonessentialism.  \n\nIt replaces each fallacy with a truth of Essentialism.  \n\nWe must conquer three assumptions to live as Essentialists.  \n\nThese assumptions are: “I have to,” “It’s all important,” and “I can do both.”  \n\nLike mythological sirens, these assumptions are dangerous and seductive.  \n\nThey draw us in and drown us in shallow waters.  \n\nTo embrace Essentialism, we must replace these false assumptions.  \n\nWe replace them with three core truths.  \n\nThese truths are: “I choose to,” “Only a few things really matter,” and “I can do anything but not everything.”  \n\nThese simple truths awaken us from our nonessential stupor.  \n\nThey free us to pursue what really matters.  \n\nThey enable us to live at our highest level of contribution.  \n\nAs we rid ourselves of Nonessentialism, we adopt Essentialism.  \n\nThe way of the Essentialist becomes natural and instinctive.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialism is a transformative way of thinking that challenges nonessential assumptions to focus on what truly matters in life."
