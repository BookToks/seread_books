  "text": "TRADE-OFF\n\nWhich problem do I want?\n\nStrategy is about making choices. \n\nTrade-offs are essential. \n\nIt’s about deliberately choosing to be different. \n\nImagine going back to 1972. \n\nYou invest a dollar in each S&P 500 company. \n\nWhich company provides the largest return by 2002? \n\nWould it be GE? \n\nWould it be IBM? \n\nWould it be Intel? \n\nAccording to Money magazine, the answer is none. \n\nThe correct answer is Southwest Airlines. \n\nThis is surprising. \n\nThe airline industry struggles to generate profits. \n\nYet Southwest, led by Herb Kelleher, thrives. \n\nThey consistently produce amazing financial results. \n\nHerb’s Essentialist approach is central to this success. \n\nI attended an event with Herb. \n\nHe was interviewed about his business strategy. \n\nIt was a great talk. \n\nWhen he discussed trade-offs, I listened closely. \n\nRather than flying to every destination, they chose point-to-point flights. \n\nInstead of raising prices for meals, they decided to serve none. \n\nInstead of assigning seats in advance, passengers choose as they board. \n\nInstead of upselling first-class service, they offered only coach. \n\nThese trade-offs were not by default. \n\nThey were made by design. \n\nEach choice was part of a deliberate strategy. \n\nThe goal was to keep costs down. \n\nDid he risk alienating customers? \n\nCustomers wanted a broader range of options.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Herb Kelleher's Essentialist approach at Southwest Airlines involved deliberate trade-offs to maintain low costs and achieve consistent financial success."
