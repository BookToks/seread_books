  "text": "Essentialists choose “no” more often than they say no.  \n\nSometimes, saying no means being blunt.  \n\nYou can say, “I’m flattered you thought of me, but I’m busy.”  \n\nOr, “I would like to, but I’m overcommitted.”  \n\nThere are many polite ways to refuse without saying no.  \n\nLater in the chapter, you’ll find more examples of this.  \n\nThe more we consider what we give up when we say yes, the easier it is to say no.  \n\nIf we lack a clear sense of opportunity cost, we may fall into the nonessential trap.  \n\nWe can’t get it all done.  \n\nA graceful “no” comes from a clear calculation of the trade-off.  \n\nEveryone is selling something.  \n\nThis doesn’t mean you should be cynical about people.  \n\nPeople should not be mistrusted.  \n\nEveryone sells an idea, viewpoint, or opinion for your time.  \n\nBeing aware of what is being sold helps us decide whether to buy it.  \n\nSaying “no” often requires trading popularity for respect.  \n\nWhen you say no, it affects the relationship.  \n\nThe immediate reaction may be annoyance or disappointment.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialists often say \"no\" gracefully by recognizing the trade-offs involved and understanding that everyone is seeking to exchange something for their time."
