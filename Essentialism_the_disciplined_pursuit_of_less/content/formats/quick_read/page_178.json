As John Lasseter said, “We don’t actually finish our films, we release them.”  \n\nThere are two ways to approach a goal or deadline.  \n\nYou can start early and small or late and big.  \n\n“Late and big” means doing it all at the last minute.  \n\nThis involves pulling an all-nighter and “making it happen.”  \n\n“Early and small” means starting at the earliest moment possible.  \n\nIt requires minimal time investment.  \n\nOften, just ten minutes invested two weeks before a deadline helps.  \n\nThis can save you from frantic scrambling at the last minute.  \n\nTake a goal you have coming up.  \n\nAsk yourself, “What is the minimal amount I could do right now to prepare?”  \n\nOne inspiring leader prepares big speeches six months in advance.  \n\nHe doesn’t prepare the entire speech; he just starts.  \n\nIf you have a big presentation coming up, open a file now.  \n\nSpend four minutes writing down any ideas.  \n\nThen close the file.  \n\nNo more than four minutes.  \n\nJust start it.  \n\nA colleague in New York uses a simple hack.  \n\nWhenever she schedules a meeting, she takes fifteen seconds.  \n\nShe types the main objectives for the meeting.  \n\nOn the morning of the meeting, she prepares talking points.  \n\nShe can refer to these objectives.  \n\nShe doesn’t need to plan the whole agenda.  \n\nJust a few seconds of early preparation pays off.  \n\nDo you remember when you were five years old?  \n\nYour school held a fund-raiser.  \n\nRemember the big thermometer showing progress toward the goal?  \n\nIt was exciting to watch the level go up each day.  \n\nOr perhaps your parents had a star chart for you.  \n\nEvery time you ate spinach or went to bed on time,\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Starting early with minimal preparation can significantly reduce stress and enhance productivity."
