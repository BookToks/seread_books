  "text": "Assigning numerical values helps us make conscious decisions.  \n\nIt encourages logical and rational thinking.  \n\nWe avoid impulsive or emotional choices.  \n\nApplying tough criteria requires discipline.  \n\nFailing to apply criteria has a high cost.  \n\nNonessentialists use unspoken criteria for decisions.  \n\nThey apply this in personal and professional lives.  \n\nFor example, in work projects, a Nonessentialist may think,  \n\n“If my manager asks me, I should do it.”  \n\nThey might also think,  \n\n“If someone asks me to do something, I should try.”  \n\nOr,  \n\n“If others in the company are doing it, I should too.”  \n\nSocial media amplifies this burden.  \n\nWe see what others do and feel pressured.  \n\nThis leads to many nonessential activities we “should” do.  \n\nNonessentialists say yes to almost every request.  \n\nThey use broad, implicit criteria.  \n\nThey think, “If someone I know is doing it, I should too.”  \n\nEssentialists say yes only to the top 10 percent of opportunities.  \n\nThey use narrow, explicit criteria.  \n\nThey ask, “Is this exactly what I am looking for?”  \n\nOne executive team I worked with had three criteria for projects.  \n\nOver time, they became indiscriminate in their choices.  \n\nThe company’s projects only reflected customer requests.  \n\nTeam morale plummeted as a result.  \n\nThey were overworked and overwhelmed.  \n\nNo project seemed to justify itself.  \n\nThere was no greater sense of purpose.  \n\nIt became hard to distinguish themselves in the marketplace.  \n\nTheir unique and profitable niche became general.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Nonessentialists make decisions based on implicit criteria, leading to overwhelm and lack of purpose, while essentialists use explicit criteria to focus on the most valuable opportunities."
