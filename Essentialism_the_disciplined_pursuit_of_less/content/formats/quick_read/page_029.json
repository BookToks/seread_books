  "text": "STEP 3. EXECUTE:\n\nREMOVING OBSTACLES AND MAKING EXECUTION EFFORTLESS\n\nWhether our goal is to complete a project at work,  \n\nreach the next step in our career,  \n\nor plan a birthday party for our spouse,  \n\nwe often think execution is hard and full of friction.  \n\nWe believe we need to force it to make it happen.  \n\nBut the Essentialist approach is different.  \n\nInstead of forcing execution,  \n\nEssentialists invest saved time into creating a system.  \n\nThis system removes obstacles and makes execution easy.  \n\nThese three elements—explore, eliminate, execute—  \n\nare not separate events.  \n\nThey are a cyclical process.  \n\nWhen we apply them consistently,  \n\nwe reap greater and greater benefits.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The Essentialist approach focuses on creating systems to remove obstacles and simplify execution rather than forcing it."
