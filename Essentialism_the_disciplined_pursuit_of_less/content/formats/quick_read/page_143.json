  "text": "Of course, editing also involves making trade-offs.  \n\nAn editor asks, “Will this make it better?”  \n\nThey do not try to fit everything in.  \n\nThis includes every character, plot twist, and detail.  \n\nFor an author, it is easy to get overly committed.  \n\nYou may become attached to certain ideas or works.  \n\nThis is especially true for work you slaved over.  \n\nIt can be painful to eliminate passages or chapters.  \n\nSome of these may have taken years to write.  \n\nYet disciplined elimination is critical to the craft.  \n\nYou must, as Stephen King said, “kill your darlings.”  \n\nThis means to let go, even when it hurts.  \n\nNonessentialists think making things better means adding.  \n\nThey are attached to every word, image, or detail.  \n\nEssentialists think making things better means subtracting.  \n\nThey eliminate distracting words, images, and details.  \n\nEditing a film or book is not the same as editing life.  \n\nIn life, we cannot revisit past conversations or meetings.  \n\nWe cannot rework them with a red pen in hand.  \n\nNevertheless, four principles of editing apply to life.  \n\nThese principles help us edit out the nonessentials.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Editing involves making trade-offs by eliminating nonessential elements to enhance the overall quality of a work."
