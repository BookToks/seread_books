  "text": "Courage is grace under pressure.  \n\nThe right “no” can change history.  \n\nRosa Parks refused to give up her seat.  \n\nThis happened on a segregated Montgomery bus.  \n\nHer refusal happened at the right moment.  \n\nIt helped propel the civil rights movement.  \n\nParks recalls the moment clearly.  \n\nThe bus driver asked if she would stand.  \n\nShe replied, “No, I’m not.”  \n\nHer courageous “no” was not typical.  \n\nIt did not come from an assertive personality.  \n\nWhen she became a secretary for the NAACP,  \n\nshe felt too timid to say no.  \n\nHer decision on the bus came from deep conviction.  \n\nShe knew what choice she wanted to make.  \n\nWhen ordered out of her seat,  \n\nshe felt determination cover her like a quilt.  \n\nShe did not know her decision would spark a movement.  \n\nBut she knew her own mind.  \n\nEven during her arrest, she understood.  \n\nShe said it was the last time she would ride in humiliation.  \n\nAvoiding that humiliation was worth the risk.  \n\nTo her, it was essential.  \n\nWe may not face Rosa Parks’s situation.  \n\nYet we can be inspired by her courage.  \n\nWe can think of her when we need to say no.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The power of a well-timed \"no,\" exemplified by Rosa Parks, can significantly influence history and inspire others to stand firm in their convictions."
