  "text": "Opportunities we pursue are often less valuable than a few great ones.  \n\nOnce we understand this, we scan for the vital few.  \n\nWe eagerly eliminate the trivial many.  \n\nOnly then can we say no to good opportunities.  \n\nWe say yes to truly great ones.  \n\nThis is why an Essentialist explores all options.  \n\nThe extra investment is justified.  \n\nSome things are much more important.  \n\nThey repay the effort tenfold.  \n\nAn Essentialist discerns more so he can do less.  \n\nA Nonessentialist thinks almost everything is essential.  \n\nHe views opportunities as basically equal.  \n\nHe thinks almost everything is nonessential.  \n\nHe distinguishes the vital few from the trivial many.  \n\nMany capable people struggle to advance.  \n\nThey can't let go of the belief that everything is important.  \n\nAn Essentialist learns to tell the difference.  \n\nHe knows what is truly important and what is not.  \n\nTo practice this skill, we start at a simple level.  \n\nOnce it becomes second nature, we apply it to bigger areas.  \n\nThese areas include our personal and professional lives.  \n\nMastering it fully requires a massive shift in thinking.  \n\nBut it can be done.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** An Essentialist focuses on identifying and pursuing the few truly valuable opportunities while eliminating the trivial many."
