  "text": "How Do We Forget Our Ability to Choose?  \n\nOne important insight explains how we forget our ability to choose.  \n\nThis insight comes from Martin Seligman and Steve Maier.  \n\nThey discovered \"learned helplessness\" while studying German shepherds.  \n\nSeligman and Maier divided the dogs into three groups.  \n\nThe first group wore a harness and received electric shocks.  \n\nThey could press a lever to stop the shock.  \n\nThe second group also wore a harness and got the same shock.  \n\nHowever, their lever didnâ€™t work.  \n\nThis made them powerless to stop the shock.  \n\nThe third group wore a harness but received no shocks.  \n\nAfterwards, each dog was placed in a large box.  \n\nThe box had a low divider in the center.  \n\nOne side of the box produced an electric shock.  \n\nThe other side did not produce any shock.  \n\nThen something interesting happened.  \n\nThe dogs that could stop the shock learned quickly.  \n\nThey stepped over the divider to avoid the shock.  \n\nThe dogs that had not been shocked also learned quickly.  \n\nThey also stepped over the divider to avoid the shock.  \n\nThe dogs that could not stop the shock did not learn.  \n\nThey did not try to escape the shock at all.  \n\nThey had learned helplessness.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** We often forget our ability to choose due to experiences of learned helplessness, as demonstrated in experiments with dogs."
