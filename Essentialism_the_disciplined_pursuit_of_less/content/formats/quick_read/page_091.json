  "text": "A blood alcohol level of 0.1% is concerning. \n\nWe would never say, “This person is a great worker! He’s drunk all the time!” \n\nYet, we celebrate people who sacrifice sleep for work. \n\nSleep is often seen as rest for the body. \n\nRecent research shows sleep is more about the brain. \n\nA study from Luebeck University in Germany supports this. \n\nA full night’s sleep may increase brain power. \n\nIt can also enhance our problem-solving ability. \n\nThe study was reported by the journal Nature. \n\nOver one hundred volunteers received a number puzzle. \n\nThe puzzle had an unconventional twist. \n\nIt required finding a “hidden code” to uncover the answer. \n\nThe volunteers were divided into two groups. \n\nOne group had an eight-hour stretch of uninterrupted sleep. \n\nThe other group received interrupted sleep. \n\nScientists watched to see who found the hidden code. \n\nThey also noted how quickly they found it. \n\nTwice the number of people who slept eight hours solved the problem. \n\nThe sleep-deprived group had fewer solutions. \n\nThe researchers explained that our brains work while we sleep. \n\nThey encode and restructure information during this time. \n\nWhen we wake up, our brains may have new connections. \n\nThis opens a broader range of solutions to problems. \n\nA nap can also increase creativity, according to science. \n\nA report from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences revealed this. \n\nEven a single REM cycle enhances integration of unassociated information. \n\nA brief period of deep sleep helps us make new connections. \n\nSleep allows us to operate at our highest level. \n\nThis helps us achieve more in less time. \n\nThere is still a culture of machismo around going without sleep. \n\nLuckily, the stigma is fading. \n\nSome super-high performers boast about getting a full eight hours. \n\nThese people are often true Essentialists. \n\nThey know their healthy sleep habits give them a competitive advantage. \n\nAnd they are right.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sleep is essential for enhancing brain function and problem-solving abilities, ultimately allowing us to achieve more in less time."
