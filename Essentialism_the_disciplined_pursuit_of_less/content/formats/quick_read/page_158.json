  "text": "C HAPTER 15\n\nBUFFER\n\nThe Unfair Advantage\n\n\"Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.\" \n\n—Attributed to Abraham Lincoln\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible, a story is told of Joseph. \n\nHe saved Egypt from a savage, seven-year famine. \n\nThe Pharaoh had a dream he could not interpret. \n\nHe asked his wisest advisers to explain it. \n\nThey couldn’t interpret it either. \n\nSomeone remembered Joseph was in prison at the time. \n\nHe had a reputation for explaining dreams. \n\nSo, he was called for. \n\nIn the dream, Pharaoh stood by a river. \n\nHe saw seven “fat-fleshed” kine come out of the water. \n\nThey fed in a meadow. \n\nThen, seven “lean-fleshed” cows came out. \n\nThe second set of cows ate the first set. \n\nJoseph explained the dream's meaning. \n\nThere would be seven years of plenty in Egypt. \n\nThen, there would be seven years of famine. \n\nJoseph suggested Pharaoh appoint someone “discreet and wise.” \n\nThis person would take a fifth of the harvest each year. \n\nThey would store it as a buffer for famine years. \n\nThe plan was approved. \n\nJoseph was given the position of vizier. \n\nHe was second in command over Egypt. \n\nHe executed the plan perfectly. \n\nWhen the famine arrived, everyone was saved. \n\nThis included Joseph’s extended family. \n\nThis simple story shows a powerful practice. \n\nEssentialists use it to ensure effortless execution. \n\nWe live in an unpredictable world. \n\nWe face the unexpected constantly.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialists create buffers to prepare for the unpredictable challenges of life, ensuring effortless execution of their plans."
