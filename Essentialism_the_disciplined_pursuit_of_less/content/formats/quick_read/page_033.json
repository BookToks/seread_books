  "text": "Essentialism is not a way to do one more thing.  \n\nIt is a different way of doing everything.  \n\nIt is a way of thinking.  \n\nInternalizing this way of thinking is not neutral.  \n\nCertain ideas pull us toward Nonessentialism.  \n\nPeople also peddle those ideas.  \n\nThere are three chapters in this part of the book.  \n\nEach chapter addresses a fallacy of Nonessentialism.  \n\nEach chapter replaces it with a truth of Essentialism.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialism is a mindset that prioritizes doing fewer things better, contrasting with the distractions of Nonessentialism."
