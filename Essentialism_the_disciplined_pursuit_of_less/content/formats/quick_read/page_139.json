  "text": "You can apply zero-based budgeting to your own endeavors.  \n\nInstead of budgeting your time based on existing commitments, start fresh.  \n\nAssume that all bets are off.  \n\nAll previous commitments are gone.  \n\nThen begin from scratch, asking what you would add today.  \n\nYou can do this with financial obligations, projects, and relationships.  \n\nEvery use of time, energy, or resources must justify itself anew.  \n\nIf it no longer fits, eliminate it altogether.  \n\nSTOP MAKING CASUAL COMMITMENTS  \n\nSome people fill their days with soft commitments.  \n\nThese commitments often arise unintentionally through casual conversations.  \n\nYou know the kind I mean.  \n\nYou chat with your neighbor about her PTA work.  \n\nYou discuss a new initiative with a colleague.  \n\nYou talk with a friend about a new restaurant.  \n\nBefore you know it, boom, you’re committed.  \n\nFROM NOW ON, PAUSE BEFORE YOU SPEAK  \n\nIt might sound obvious, but pausing helps.  \n\nPause for just five seconds before offering your services.  \n\nThis can reduce the chance of regrettable commitments.  \n\nBefore saying, “That sounds great, I’d love to,” ask yourself, “Is this essential?”  \n\nIf you’ve made a casual commitment you regret, find a way out.  \n\nApologize and explain that you didn’t realize what it would entail.  \n\nGET OVER THE FEAR OF MISSING OUT  \n\nWe’ve seen evidence that most of us are loss-averse.  \n\nAs a result, fear of missing out hinders us from uncommitting.  \n\nWe worry about losing something great.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Applying zero-based budgeting to personal commitments encourages starting from scratch to evaluate and eliminate nonessential obligations."
