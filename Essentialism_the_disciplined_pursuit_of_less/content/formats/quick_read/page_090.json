  "text": "Shattering the Sleep Stigma\n\nWe give up our precious sleep easily.\n\nOverachievers often believe sleeping less leads to achieving more.\n\nThis assumption is false.\n\nResearch shows that good sleep makes us more productive.\n\nK. Anders Ericsson studied violinists.\n\nMalcolm Gladwell popularized this as “the 10,000-Hour Rule.”\n\nEricsson found that the best violinists practiced more.\n\nThis supports Essentialist logic.\n\nMastery requires focused and deliberate effort.\n\nExcellence is within our control.\n\nIt is not just for the naturally gifted.\n\nHowever, this can encourage the Nonessentialist mind-set.\n\nThe myth of “I have to do it all” is dangerous.\n\nIt justifies longer work hours with diminishing returns.\n\nA lesser-known finding from the same study exists.\n\nThe second most important factor was sleep.\n\nThe best violinists averaged 8.6 hours of sleep daily.\n\nThis is about an hour longer than the average American.\n\nThey also napped for an average of 2.8 hours.\n\nThis is about two hours longer than the average.\n\nSleep helped these performers regenerate.\n\nThey could practice with greater concentration.\n\nThey practiced more and got more from their practice.\n\nThey were better rested.\n\nCharles A. Czeisler wrote an article in Harvard Business Review.\n\nHe discussed sleep deficit as a performance killer.\n\nHe compared sleep deprivation to drinking too much alcohol.\n\nPulling an all-nighter induces significant impairment.\n\nSleeping four or five hours a night for a week does too.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The belief that sacrificing sleep leads to greater achievement is challenged by research showing that adequate sleep enhances productivity and performance."
