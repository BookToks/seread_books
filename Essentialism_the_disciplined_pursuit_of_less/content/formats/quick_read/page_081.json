  "text": "Stress affects our ability to think clearly. \n\nIt increases activity in the amygdala. \n\nThis part of the brain monitors emotions. \n\nIt reduces activity in the hippocampus. \n\nThe hippocampus is responsible for cognitive function. \n\nI have seen play reverse these effects in my children. \n\nWhen they are stressed, I have them draw. \n\nThe change is almost immediate. \n\nThe stress melts away. \n\nTheir ability to explore is regained. \n\nPlay positively affects the executive function of the brain. \n\nEdward M. Hallowell explains this effect. \n\nHe specializes in brain science. \n\nHe writes about the brain’s executive functions. \n\nThese include planning, prioritizing, and scheduling. \n\nThey also include anticipating, delegating, and deciding. \n\nThese skills are essential for excelling in business. \n\nPlay stimulates parts of the brain for reasoning. \n\nIt also stimulates parts for carefree exploration. \n\nKey breakthroughs often happen during play. \n\nHallowell notes examples of this. \n\nColumbus was at play when he realized the world was round. \n\nNewton was at play when he saw the apple tree. \n\nHe conceived of the force of gravity then. \n\nWatson and Crick were playing with DNA shapes. \n\nThey discovered the double helix during this play. \n\nShakespeare played with iambic pentameter all his life. \n\nMozart rarely lived a moment without play. \n\nEinstein’s thought experiments show the mind invited to play.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Play enhances cognitive function and creativity, helping to alleviate stress and stimulate innovative thinking."
