  "text": "No clear direction exists. \n\nPeople pursue their own short-term interests. \n\nThey have little awareness of their activities' impact. \n\nThese activities can derail the team's long-term mission. \n\nOften, these activities are well-intentioned. \n\nSome may even be essential on a personal level. \n\nHowever, many disparate projects conflict with each other. \n\nThey do not lead to the team's highest contribution. \n\nTeams like this take five steps back for each step forward. \n\nSimilarly, individuals involved in too many activities struggle. \n\nEven good activities can prevent achieving their essential mission. \n\nThe activities do not work in concert. \n\nThey fail to create a meaningful whole. \n\nFor example, pursuing five different majors does not equal a degree. \n\nLikewise, five different jobs in different industries do not build a career. \n\nWithout clarity and purpose, good pursuits are not enough. \n\nRalph Waldo Emerson said, \"The crime which bankrupts men and states is that of job-work;â€”declining from your main design to serve a turn here or there.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Without clear direction, individuals and teams may pursue well-intentioned activities that ultimately detract from their long-term mission and contributions."
