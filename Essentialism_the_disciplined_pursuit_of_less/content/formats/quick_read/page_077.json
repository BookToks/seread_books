  "text": "At the end of Mary Poppins, Mr. Banks comes home. \n\nHe has been sacked and discharged. \n\nYet, he seems delighted and uncharacteristically happy. \n\nOne servant concludes he’s “gone off his crumpet.” \n\nHis son observes, “It doesn’t sound like Father.” \n\nMr. Banks is almost a new person now. \n\nHe presents his children with their mended kite. \n\nHe launches into the song “Let’s Go Fly a Kite.” \n\nFreed from his dreary job, his inner child awakens. \n\nHis good cheer lifts the spirits of the whole house. \n\nIt infuses the melancholic Banks family with joy. \n\nThis is a fictional story, but it shows something real. \n\nIt illustrates the powerful effects of restoring play in life. \n\nMost of us were not taught how to play formally. \n\nWe picked it up naturally and instinctively. \n\nPicture a newborn baby’s joy during peekaboo. \n\nThink of children unleashing their imaginations in make-believe. \n\nImagine a child in flow, creating a minikingdom. \n\nBut as we grow older, something changes. \n\nWe learn that play is trivial and a waste of time. \n\nWe hear that play is unnecessary and childish. \n\nMany of these negative messages come from where play should thrive.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Restoring play to our lives can rejuvenate our spirits and foster joy and creativity."
