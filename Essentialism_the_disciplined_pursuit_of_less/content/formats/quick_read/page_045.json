  "text": "Some believe the relationship between efforts and results is less linear.  \n\nScientists call this a “power law.”  \n\nAccording to the power law theory, some efforts yield exponentially more results.  \n\nFor example, Nathan Myhrvold said top software developers are more productive.  \n\nHe stated they are not 10X or 100X more productive.  \n\nThey are 10,000X more productive.  \n\nIt may be an exaggeration, but it makes a point.  \n\nCertain efforts produce exponentially better results than others.  \n\nThe overwhelming reality is we live in a world of worthlessness.  \n\nVery few things are exceptionally valuable.  \n\nJohn Maxwell wrote, “You cannot overestimate the unimportance of practically everything.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Certain efforts yield exponentially better results than others, highlighting the importance of focusing on what is truly valuable."
