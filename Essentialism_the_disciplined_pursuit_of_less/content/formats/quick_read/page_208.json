  "text": "I said no to all of them.  \n\nDespite the uncertainty, I felt calm.  \n\nI felt focused and in control.  \n\nI applied only to Stanford, both times.  \n\nWhen I received my offer the second time, it was clear.  \n\nThis was the most vital thing for me.  \n\nIt was the right path at the right time.  \n\nIt confirmed the way of the Essentialist.  \n\nHad I not chosen this path, I might not have pursued Stanford.  \n\nI might not have written for Harvard Business Review.  \n\nI would never have written these words.  \n\nYou are now reading, absorbing, and thinking about them.  \n\nBecoming an Essentialist is a long process.  \n\nThe benefits are endless.  \n\nThe disciplined pursuit of less can change your life.  \n\nRemember the metaphorical closet from chapter 1?  \n\nAs you clear out your closet, you will reorder what matters.  \n\nLife will be less about crossing off to-do lists.  \n\nIt will be more about changing what you put on there.  \n\nEvery day, the essential things become clearer.  \n\nThey are more important than the next most important thing.  \n\nExecuting those essentials becomes more effortless.  \n\nYou will gain confidence in your ability to pause.  \n\nYou can push back or not rush in.  \n\nYou will feel less a function of others' agendas.  \n\nIf you donâ€™t prioritize your life, someone else will.  \n\nBut if you prioritize your life, you can.  \n\nThe power is yours.  \n\nIt is within you.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Becoming an Essentialist leads to greater clarity and control in prioritizing what truly matters in life."
