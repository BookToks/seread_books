  "text": "I stared, wide-eyed, at the piece of paper in my hands.  \n\nI was sitting in the foyer of a high-rise office building.  \n\nIt was dusk, and the last few people were trickling out.  \n\nThe piece of paper was covered with scribbled words and arrows.  \n\nIt was the result of a twenty-minute spontaneous brainstorm.  \n\nI thought about what I currently wanted to be doing with my life.  \n\nAs I looked at the paper, I noticed what wasn’t on it.  \n\nLaw school was not on the list.  \n\nThis got my attention because I was halfway through law school.  \n\nI was studying law in England.  \n\nI had applied to study law due to repeated advice.  \n\nPeople told me to “keep your options open.”  \n\nOnce I graduated, I could practice law.  \n\nI could write about law.  \n\nI could teach law.  \n\nI could consult on the law.  \n\nThe world would be my oyster, or so the argument went.  \n\nYet from the first moment I started studying law, I struggled.  \n\nInstead of choosing between these pursuits, I tried to fit them all in.  \n\nI studied my law books at all hours all day.  \n\nI read the great management thinkers in the evenings.  \n\nIn spare moments, I would write.  \n\nIt was a classic “straddled strategy.”  \n\nI attempted to invest in everything at once.  \n\nThe result was that I was not entirely failing in any pursuit.  \n\nHowever, I was not entirely succeeding at any either.  \n\nI soon began to wonder what was so great about all these open options.  \n\nIn the middle of this existential confusion, I received a call.  \n\nA friend in the United States invited me to his wedding.  \n\nHe had already bought and sent the tickets.  \n\nSo I gratefully accepted his invitation.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The power of choice is fundamental to our humanity, as illustrated by the author's realization that law school was not aligned with his true desires."
