  "text": "The dogs did not adapt or adjust.  \n\nThey did nothing to avoid getting shocked.  \n\nThey didn’t know they had any choice.  \n\nThey had learned helplessness.  \n\nHumans learn helplessness in similar ways.  \n\nOne example is a child struggling with mathematics.  \n\nHe tries and tries but never improves.  \n\nEventually, he gives up.  \n\nHe believes nothing he does will matter.  \n\nI have seen learned helplessness in many organizations.  \n\nWhen people believe their efforts don’t matter, they respond in two ways.  \n\nSome check out and stop trying.  \n\nOthers become hyperactive.  \n\nThey accept every opportunity presented.  \n\nThey throw themselves into every assignment.  \n\nThey tackle every challenge with gusto.  \n\nThey try to do it all.  \n\nThis behavior doesn’t look like learned helplessness at first.  \n\nIsn’t working hard evidence of one’s value?  \n\nOn closer examination, this compulsion is a smokescreen.  \n\nThese people don’t believe they have a choice.  \n\nThey believe they have to do it all.  \n\nChoices are hard, and I admit that.  \n\nThey involve saying no to something.  \n\nThat can feel like a loss.  \n\nOutside the workplace, choices can be harder.  \n\nStores and restaurants are designed to make saying no difficult.  \n\nPolitical advertisements aim to make voting for the other side unthinkable.  \n\nWhen our mother-in-law calls, it can feel hard to choose.  \n\nIt’s not surprising we forget our ability to choose.  \n\nChoice is at the core of being an Essentialist.  \n\nBecoming an Essentialist requires awareness of our ability to choose.  \n\nWe need to recognize it as an invincible power within us.  \n\nThis power exists separate from any other thing, person, or force.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Humans can learn helplessness when they believe their efforts do not matter, leading to a loss of the ability to choose."
