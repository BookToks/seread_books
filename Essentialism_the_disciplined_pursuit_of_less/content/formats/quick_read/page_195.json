  "text": "I ran into a former classmate years after graduation.\n\nI was on campus working on a computer.\n\nHe came over to say hi.\n\nAfter a minute of pleasantries, he mentioned he was between jobs.\n\nHe explained the job he was looking for.\n\nHe asked if I could help him.\n\nI asked questions to see how I could help.\n\nTwenty seconds into our conversation, he got a text.\n\nWithout a word, he looked down and started responding.\n\nI paused and waited, as I usually do.\n\nTen seconds went by.\n\nThen twenty seconds passed.\n\nI stood there as he texted furiously.\n\nHe didn’t say anything or acknowledge me.\n\nOut of curiosity, I waited to see how long it would last.\n\nAfter two full minutes, I gave up.\n\nI walked back to my desk and returned to my work.\n\nAfter five more minutes, he became present again.\n\nHe interrupted me for the second time.\n\nNow he wanted to resume our conversation.\n\nHe wanted help with his job search again.\n\nInitially, I was ready to recommend him for a job.\n\nBut after this incident, I felt hesitant.\n\nI worried he might not be present during an interview.\n\nHe might be present in body, but not in mind.\n\nAt this point, you might expect me to discuss multitasking.\n\nYou might think I would say Essentialists never do more than one thing.\n\nBut we can easily do two things at the same time.\n\nWe can wash dishes and listen to the radio.\n\nWe can eat and talk.\n\nWe can clear clutter while thinking about lunch.\n\nWe can text while watching television.\n\nWhat we can’t do is concentrate on two things at once.\n\nWhen I talk about being present, I mean focusing on one thing.\n\nMultitasking is not the enemy of Essentialism.\n\nPretending we can \"multifocus\" is the real issue.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Essentialists prioritize being focused on one task at a time rather than attempting to multitask, which leads to greater presence and effectiveness."
