  "text": "Working out became more difficult the more I invested.  \n\nMy irrational response was to invest even more.  \n\nI thought, “I can make this work!”  \n\nI did not want to accept my wasted effort.  \n\nI finally shared my frustration with a friend.  \n\nThis friend was emotionally removed from the project.  \n\nHe wasn’t burdened with the sunk costs.  \n\nHe could evaluate my decisions with perspective.  \n\nAfter listening to me, he said, “You’re not married to this.”  \n\nWith those words, I felt liberated to stop investing.  \n\nI stopped investing in a nonessential.  \n\nBe aware of the status quo bias.  \n\nThis is the tendency to continue doing something.  \n\nWe do this simply because we have always done it.  \n\nI once worked at a company with an outdated evaluation system.  \n\nI became curious about how long it had been in place.  \n\nI searched for its creator in the company.  \n\nNobody knew its origin, including the head of HR.  \n\nMore shockingly, nobody questioned the system in ten years.  \n\nIt’s easy to accept commitments without questioning them.  \n\nOne cure for the status quo bias is zero-based budgeting.  \n\nTypically, accountants use last year’s budget as a baseline.  \n\nWith zero-based budgeting, they use zero as the baseline.  \n\nEvery item in the proposed budget must be justified from scratch.  \n\nThis takes more effort but has many advantages.  \n\nIt allocates resources based on needs rather than history.  \n\nIt detects exaggerated budget requests.  \n\nIt draws attention to obsolete operations.  \n\nIt encourages clarity in purpose and expense alignment.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Admitting mistakes and questioning established commitments can liberate us from nonessential investments and improve decision-making."
