  "text": "People with Essentialism at their core gain more from their investment.  \n\nThose who only absorb it at the surface level do not.  \n\nIndeed, the benefits become cumulative.  \n\nEvery choice to pursue the essential builds on itself.  \n\nWe eliminate the nonessential with each choice we make.  \n\nThis makes the choice more habitual over time.  \n\nEventually, it becomes virtually second nature.  \n\nWith time, our inner core expands outward.  \n\nIt eclipses the part of us mired in the nonessential.  \n\nIt is easy to get caught in the \"paradox of success.\"  \n\nWe have clarity of purpose, which leads to success.  \n\nBut success brings new options and opportunities.  \n\nThis sounds good, but remember the distractions.  \n\nThese options can tempt us and lure us away.  \n\nOur clarity becomes clouded as a result.  \n\nSoon, we find ourselves spread too thin.  \n\nNow, we are not utilized at our highest potential.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Embracing Essentialism leads to greater cumulative benefits and a clearer focus on meaningful accomplishments by eliminating the nonessential."
