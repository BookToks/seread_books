  "text": "Some believe the relationship between efforts and results is not linear.  \n\nScientists call this a “power law.”  \n\nAccording to the power law theory, some efforts yield much greater results.  \n\nCertain efforts produce exponentially more results than others.  \n\nFor example, Nathan Myhrvold, a former Microsoft officer, has said this.  \n\nHe confirmed it to me in person.  \n\nHe said the top software developers are much more productive.  \n\nThey are not more productive by a small amount.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Certain efforts yield disproportionately greater results, highlighting the importance of focusing on what truly matters."
