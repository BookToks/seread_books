  "text": "There are four parts to the book. \n\nThe first outlines the core mind-set of an Essentialist. \n\nThe next three turn the mind-set into a systematic process. \n\nThis process helps in the disciplined pursuit of less. \n\nYou can use it in any situation or endeavor. \n\nA description of each part of the book is below. \n\nESSENCE: WHAT IS THE CORE MIND-SET OF AN ESSENTIALIST? \n\nThis part outlines three realities of Essentialist thinking. \n\nWithout these realities, Essentialist thinking is not relevant or possible. \n\nOne chapter is devoted to each reality in turn. \n\n1. Individual choice: We can choose how to spend our energy and time. \n\nWithout choice, there is no point in talking about trade-offs. \n\n2. The prevalence of noise: Almost everything is noise. \n\nVery few things are exceptionally valuable. \n\nThis justifies taking time to find what is most important. \n\nSome things are much more important than others. \n\nThe effort to find those things is worth it. \n\n3. The reality of trade-offs: We can’t have it all or do it all. \n\nIf we could, there would be no reason to evaluate options. \n\nOnce we accept trade-offs, we stop asking, “How can I make it all work?” \n\nWe start asking, “Which problem do I want to solve?” \n\nOnly when we understand these realities can we think like an Essentialist. \n\nOnce we fully accept them, the method becomes natural and instinctive. \n\nThat method consists of three simple steps. \n\nSTEP 1. EXPLORE: DISCERNING THE TRIVIAL MANY FROM THE VITAL FEW \n\nOne paradox of Essentialism is that Essentialists explore more options. \n\nNonessentialists commit to everything without actually exploring.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The book outlines a systematic process for the disciplined pursuit of less, emphasizing the core mind-set of an Essentialist."
