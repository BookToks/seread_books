  "text": "Our help is uniquely invaluable. \n\nPeople requesting help often don't care who helps them. \n\nThey just want the help. \n\nKay Krill is the CEO of Ann, Inc. \n\nShe struggled to say no to social invitations. \n\nAs a result, she attended networking events she disliked. \n\nShe regretted going to office parties as soon as she arrived. \n\nOne day, a mentor advised her to let go of what didn't matter. \n\nThis would allow her to focus her energy on meaningful things. \n\nThat advice liberated her. \n\nNow she can pick and choose her commitments. \n\nWith practice, she finds it easy to decline invitations. \n\nKay explains, “I say no very easily. \n\nI know what is important to me. \n\nI only wish I learned this earlier in my life.” \n\nSaying no is a leadership capability. \n\nIt is not just a peripheral skill. \n\nWe start with limited experience in saying no. \n\nWe are novices at saying no. \n\nThen we learn basic techniques. \n\nWe make mistakes and learn from them. \n\nWe develop more skills over time. \n\nWe keep practicing our ability to say no. \n\nEventually, we have a repertoire at our disposal. \n\nIn time, we gain mastery of this social art form. \n\nWe can handle almost any request with grace and dignity. \n\nTom Friel, former CEO of Heidrick & Struggles, once said, \n\n“We need to learn the slow ‘yes’ and the quick ‘no.’”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Learning to say no effectively allows individuals to focus their energy on what truly matters to them."
