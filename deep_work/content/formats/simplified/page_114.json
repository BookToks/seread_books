  "simplified_text": "Lewis is worried that making things more accessible will drain his energy and hurt his ability to write great stories. He says, “It’s crazy how much people are always available. A lot of the communication in my life isn’t helpful; it actually makes things worse.” Packer also has concerns about distractions, calling Twitter “crack for media addicts.” He even describes Carr’s excitement about Twitter as “the scariest view of the future I’ve seen this decade.”\n\nWe don’t need to debate whether these authors are right to stay away from Twitter and similar tools because their success shows they know what they’re doing. Instead, we can see their choices as brave examples of how to pick the right tools for the job. Many creative workers are still stuck thinking any tool is good, so it’s nice to see a more thoughtful way of choosing what to use. But the fact that these examples are rare reminds us that making smart choices like this isn’t easy. Think about the complicated decisions Forrest Pritchard had to make about his hay baler; many workers face similar challenges when choosing their tools. This strategy aims to help simplify the process of figuring out which tools really matter to you.\n\nThe first step is to figure out your main goals in both your work and personal life. If you have a family, your personal goals might include being a good parent and keeping your home organized. For work, your goals will depend on your job. For example, as a professor, I focus on being a great teacher and mentor for my students while also being a good researcher. Your goals will probably be different, but it’s important to keep the list short and focused on what really matters. If your goal is too specific, like “to make a million dollars” or “to publish six papers in a year,” it’s too detailed for this process. By the end, you should have a few key goals for both your personal and work life.\n\nAfter you’ve identified your goals, write down two or three important activities for each goal that help you achieve them. These activities should be clear enough that you can easily picture doing them, but general enough that they aren’t tied to one specific result. For example, saying “do better research” is a good start. \n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Lewis and Packer share concerns about the distractions of social media and how it affects their work. They emphasize the importance of choosing tools wisely based on personal and professional goals. The strategy involves identifying key goals and activities that help achieve them without getting bogged down in specifics.",
