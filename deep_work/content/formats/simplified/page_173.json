  "text": "After Malcolm Gladwell made the idea of deliberate practice popular in his 2008 book, *Outliers: The Story of Success*, some psychologists started to criticize it. They were generally skeptical of Gladwell's ideas. Most of these studies didn’t prove that deliberate practice wasn’t important; instead, they tried to find other factors that also help people become experts. \n\nIn a 2013 article called “Why Expert Performance Is Special and Cannot Be Extrapolated from Studies of Performance in the General Population: A Response to Criticisms,” published in the journal *Intelligence*, Ericsson responded to many of these criticisms. He argued that the way these studies were designed was often flawed because they wrongly assumed that the differences between average and above-average performers could be compared to the differences between experts and non-experts.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Malcolm Gladwell's idea of deliberate practice was criticized by some psychologists, but many studies just looked for other factors that help people succeed. Ericsson defended deliberate practice, saying that some studies were poorly designed and made wrong assumptions about expert performance."
