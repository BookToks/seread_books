  "simplified_text": "Many creative thinkers have strict routines they follow. If you're open to changing your plans when a new idea pops up, you're just as good as someone who gets distracted but can jump on a great idea when it comes.\n\nTo sum it up, the reason for this approach is that you need to value your time. A good first step is to plan out what you’ll do with every minute of your workday. At first, it might feel weird because it’s easier to let your moods or other people's demands control your schedule. But if you want to reach your full potential as a creator, you need to get comfortable with having some structure.\n\nFigure Out How Much Time You Spend on Each Task  \nOne benefit of planning your day is that you can see how much time you waste on easy tasks. However, figuring out what counts as a shallow task can be tricky. Let’s remember what shallow work means:  \nShallow Work: Tasks that don’t require much thinking, often done while distracted. These tasks usually don’t create much new value and are easy to do again.\n\nSome tasks are clearly shallow, like checking emails or setting up a conference call. But other tasks can be harder to classify. For example:  \n- Editing a draft of an academic article you’re submitting with a partner.  \n- Creating a PowerPoint presentation about sales figures for the quarter.  \n- Going to a meeting to talk about an important project and decide on what to do next.\n\nIt’s not always easy to tell how to label these tasks. The first two can be pretty challenging, while the last one seems important for moving a project forward. The goal of this strategy is to help you figure out how to categorize these tasks clearly and consistently.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** This passage talks about the importance of planning your workday to respect your time. It explains how to identify shallow tasks that don’t add much value and encourages finding a balance between structure and creativity for better productivity.",
