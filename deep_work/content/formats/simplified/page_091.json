  "simplified_text": "Shutdown rituals can be a bit annoying because they add an extra ten to fifteen minutes to your workday, or sometimes even longer. But they are important for helping you relax and enjoy your free time. From what I've seen, it takes about a week or two for this habit to stick. That means your brain needs time to trust the routine enough to let go of work thoughts in the evening. Once it becomes a habit, it will be a regular part of your life, and if you skip it, you might feel a little off.\n\nResearch from different areas of psychology shows that taking breaks helps your brain work better when you focus. When you work, give it your all. But when you’re done, really be done. Your response time to emails might slow down a bit, but you’ll get a lot more important work done during the day because you’ll be able to think more clearly than your tired friends.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Shutdown rituals help you relax after work, even if they take extra time. They become a habit that helps you focus better, allowing you to do more important work each day.",
