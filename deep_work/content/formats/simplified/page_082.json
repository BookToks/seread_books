For example, when I was doing my academic research, I used to look at things like how many papers I published each year. But those numbers didn’t really help me change what I did every day because I couldn’t do anything right away to make a difference. When I started tracking how many hours I spent in deep work, it made a big difference. Every extra hour of deep work showed up in my count, which motivated me.\n\n**Discipline #3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard** \n\nThe authors of 4DX say, “People play differently when they’re keeping score.” This means that if you want your team to care about a big goal, they need a way to see their progress. Having a scoreboard makes it feel like a competition, which helps everyone stay focused, even when other things try to distract them. Plus, when the team sees they’re doing well, they want to keep it up.\n\nEarlier, I mentioned that for someone focused on deep work, the hours spent working deeply should be the main measure. So, the scoreboard should show how many deep work hours you have. In my early attempts with 4DX, I created a simple scoreboard. I took a piece of card stock, divided it into rows for each week of the semester, and labeled them with the dates. I taped it next to my computer so I would see it all the time. Each week, I tracked my deep work hours with tick marks. To make it even more motivating, whenever I reached an important point in my work, like solving a tough problem, I would circle the tick mark for that hour.\n\nThis helped me in two ways. First, it made me feel connected to the hours I spent working deeply.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Focus on what you can control now to help achieve long-term goals. Tracking deep work hours can motivate you. A scoreboard helps keep everyone engaged and shows progress, making the work feel more rewarding.",
