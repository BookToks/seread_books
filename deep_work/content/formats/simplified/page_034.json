  "simplified_text": "Every day, a lot of emails are sent, and each one has a certain number of words. Tom Cochran looked at how much time employees spend typing and reading these emails, along with their salaries. He found out that Atlantic Media was spending over a million dollars a year just to handle emails. Each email cost the company about ninety-five cents in labor. Cochran pointed out that what seems like a \"free and easy\" way to communicate actually costs a lot, almost like buying a small jet.\n\nCochran's experiment showed how surprising the real cost of something that seems harmless can be. But the main point of the story is how complicated it is to figure out how our email habits affect a company's profits. He had to do a big survey and collect a lot of data from the IT department. He also needed to gather salary info and typing and reading speeds, then run everything through a model to get his results. Even then, it was hard to tell how much value all those emails created to balance out their costs.\n\nThis situation is similar to many behaviors that can either hurt or help focused work. Even though we know distractions can be costly and deep work is valuable, measuring these effects is tricky. This isn’t just about distractions; as jobs become more complex, it gets harder to see how much each person contributes. The economist Thomas Piketty pointed out that it’s tough to measure what individuals do for a company. Without clear measurements, things like high executive salaries can happen, even if they don’t match the actual work done. While some of Piketty’s ideas are debated, many agree that it’s hard to measure individual contributions.\n\nSo, we shouldn’t expect to easily see how behaviors that disrupt deep work affect a company’s profits. As Cochran found, these measurements often fall into a confusing area that’s hard to assess, which I call the \"metric black hole.\"\n\nJust because it’s tough to measure the impact of deep work doesn’t mean businesses will ignore it. There are plenty of behaviors that are hard to quantify but still matter a lot.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Tom Cochran's study revealed that email communication costs companies a lot more than expected. Measuring the impact of distractions and deep work is complicated, making it hard to see their effects on profits. Despite this, businesses still recognize the importance of focused work.",
