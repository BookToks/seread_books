  "simplified_text": "This strategy says you should take a break from work stuff every day, like Kreider does, to help you focus better on important tasks. There are different ways to do this. You could try Kreider's method of completely escaping from everyday tasks by going somewhere quiet, but that’s not realistic for most people. Instead, I suggest a simpler but still effective idea: after your workday ends, stop thinking about work until the next morning. No checking emails after dinner, no replaying conversations in your head, and no planning for future problems; just let work thoughts go. If you need more time to finish, you can work longer, but once you decide to stop, your mind should be free to enjoy other things.\n\nBefore I share some tips to help with this strategy, let’s look at why shutting down is good for your ability to create valuable work. We have Kreider’s personal experience, but it’s also important to understand the science behind why downtime matters. Research shows three main reasons why taking breaks can be helpful.\n\nReason #1: Downtime Helps You Get Insights  \nA study from 2006 published in the journal Science talks about how thinking too hard about decisions might not be the best way to make them. The researchers, led by Dutch psychologist Ap Dijksterhuis, wanted to show that sometimes it’s better to let your unconscious mind figure things out. Basically, if you try too hard to make a decision, you might end up with a worse choice than if you just gather the info and then let your mind relax for a bit.\n\nDijksterhuis’s team tested this by giving people information about buying a car. One group was told to think carefully about the info and then make a decision. The other group had to solve easy puzzles after reading the info, so they didn’t think about the decision right away. When it was time to decide, the distracted group made better choices.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Taking breaks from work can help you focus better and make smarter decisions. Research shows that letting your mind relax can lead to better insights and choices, rather than overthinking everything.",
