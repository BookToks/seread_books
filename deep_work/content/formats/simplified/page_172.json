  "text": "The way real companies use technology shows that the idea of using simple products in schools to prepare students for tech jobs is pretty silly. Just giving students iPads or letting them film their homework for YouTube doesn’t really help them succeed in a high-tech world. It’s like saying that playing with toy cars will make someone a good mechanic.\n\nTo really get ready for tech jobs, students need more than just basic tools. They need to learn about the actual technology and skills that companies use every day. \n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage argues that using simple tech in schools, like iPads or YouTube, doesn't truly prepare students for high-tech jobs. Real preparation requires learning about the actual technology and skills used in the industry."
