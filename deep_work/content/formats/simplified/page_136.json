  "simplified_text": "You might need to understand how people work together and how projects really get done at your job. You may be thinking if a recent college grad needs to know a lot about the project topic. For a planning meeting, probably not. These meetings usually have a lot of small talk, where people try to look busy without actually doing much. Give a smart recent grad three months to learn everything, and they could easily take your spot in these meetings. So, let's say three months is the answer.\n\nThis question is just for thinking, not for actually hiring someone new to do easy tasks. But the answers will help you see how deep or shallow different activities are. If our college grad needs a long time to learn a task, it means that task requires real skills. As mentioned before, tasks that need your skills are more valuable and help you grow. On the flip side, if the grad can learn a task quickly, it’s likely a shallow task.\n\nWhat should you do with this idea? Once you know which activities are deep or shallow, spend more time on the deep ones. Looking at our examples, the first task is worth your time, while the second and third tasks should be done less. They might seem busy, but they don’t give much back for the time you put in.\n\nOf course, figuring out how to spend less time on shallow work isn’t always easy, even if you know what your tasks are. This leads us to some strategies that will help you with this challenge.\n\nAsk your boss how much time should be spent on shallow work. This is an important question that doesn’t get asked often. If you have a boss, talk to them about it. You might need to explain what “shallow” and “deep” work mean first. If you work for yourself, ask yourself this question. In both cases, come up with a clear answer.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Understanding the difference between deep and shallow work is important for managing time effectively. Focus on deep tasks that require skills for better results and growth. Discuss with your boss how much time should be spent on shallow work to improve productivity.",
