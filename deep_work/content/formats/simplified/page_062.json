  "simplified_text": "Years of email is way too much for one lifetime. Email is great for people who like to stay on top of everything. But that’s not me; I prefer to focus on my work. What I do needs long hours of studying and deep concentration.\n\nKnuth says he doesn’t want to completely shut himself off from the world. He knows that writing his books means he has to talk to a lot of people, and he wants to respond to their questions and comments. His solution? He gives out a postal mailing address. His assistant will sort through the letters that come to that address and keep the important ones. If something is really urgent, she’ll make sure Knuth sees it quickly, and he’ll deal with everything else every three months or so.\n\nKnuth uses what I call the \"monastic philosophy\" of deep work scheduling. This idea is all about focusing on deep work by cutting down on shallow tasks. People who follow this philosophy usually have a clear and important goal they are working towards, and most of their success comes from doing that one thing really well. This focus helps them avoid getting stuck in a bunch of minor worries that can distract others.\n\nFor example, Knuth describes his goal like this: “I try to learn certain areas of computer science really well; then I share that knowledge in a way that’s easy for busy people to understand.” Trying to convince Knuth to build a following on Twitter or use email more won’t work because those things don’t help him reach his goal of deeply understanding computer science and writing about it clearly.\n\nAnother person who believes in deep work is the famous science fiction writer Neal Stephenson. If you check out his author website, you won’t find an email or mailing address. We can understand why from some essays he wrote on his old website in the early 2000s, which are still available online. In one of those essays from 2003, Stephenson explains his communication policy like this: \n\n“People who want to interrupt my focus are kindly asked not to, and I don’t answer emails… just to make it clear, I will put it.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how some people, like Knuth and Stephenson, focus deeply on their work by limiting distractions like email. They have clear goals and prefer to communicate less to maintain concentration. This approach helps them achieve their professional success.",
