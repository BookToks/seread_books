  "simplified_text": "Hey professor. I’d like to come by sometime to chat about <topic X>. Are you free?\n\nThis message is too vague, making it hard for the professor to reply quickly. Plus, it doesn’t explain why the meeting would be worth their time. Here’s a better version that’s more likely to get a response: \n\nHi professor. I’m working on a project related to <topic X> with my advisor, <professor Y>. Can I stop by during the last fifteen minutes of your office hours on Thursday to share what we’re doing and see if it connects with your current project?\n\nThis message clearly shows why the meeting is a good idea and makes it easier for the professor to respond.\n\nThis tip suggests you should handle emails like professors do. Here are three rules to help you decide which emails to answer and which to ignore:\n\n**Professorial Email Sorting:**\n- Don’t reply if the email is unclear or hard to respond to.\n- Don’t reply if it’s not something you’re interested in.\n- Don’t reply if nothing good will come from it and nothing bad will happen if you don’t.\n\nOf course, there are exceptions. If a confusing email comes from your company’s CEO, you should respond. But in general, this approach encourages you to be more selective about replying to emails.\n\nThis might feel weird at first because people usually expect replies, even if the email isn’t relevant. Some people might get confused or upset, especially if they’re not used to this way of handling emails.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** This passage explains how to write better emails to professors and when to decide not to reply. It offers tips on making your emails clearer and more relevant, helping you get better responses.",
