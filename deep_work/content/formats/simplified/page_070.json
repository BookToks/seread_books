  "simplified_text": "Each week, I plan out my important tasks and then adjust them at the start of each day. This helps me save mental energy for actually doing the deep thinking I need to do.\n\nScheduling deep work can be tough, but if you believe in what you're creating and practice focusing deeply, it can help you get a lot done even with a busy schedule.\n\nHaving a routine is really important for people who create valuable things. For example, Robert Caro, a famous biographer, has strict rules about how he organizes his office, where he puts his books, and even what he wears. He believes being organized helps him work better.\n\nCharles Darwin also had a strict daily routine while he was working on his famous book, \"On the Origin of Species.\" He would wake up at seven, take a short walk, eat breakfast alone, and then spend time in his study. He would read letters and think about tough ideas while walking a specific path on his property. He would keep walking until he felt satisfied with his thoughts before ending his workday.\n\nMason Currey, who studied the habits of famous thinkers and writers, pointed out that many people believe artists just wait for inspiration to hit them. But he believes that waiting for inspiration is a bad idea. In fact, one of the best pieces of advice for anyone doing creative work is to stop waiting for inspiration.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Planning your work week and sticking to a routine helps save mental energy for deep thinking. Famous creators like Robert Caro and Charles Darwin show that having strict habits can lead to better focus and productivity. Waiting for inspiration is not a good strategy for creative work.",
