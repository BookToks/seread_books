  "simplified_text": "One example of how businesses can mess up is by doing things that don’t really help them grow, but they keep doing it because it’s easy. For instance, think about how many meetings people have for projects. These meetings can pile up and mess up everyone’s schedule, making it hard to focus on work. Why do they keep happening? Because they’re easier. \n\nFor many people, these regular meetings are a simple way to stay organized. Instead of managing their time and tasks on their own, they let these meetings push them to take action on projects. It gives them a false sense of progress.\n\nAnother annoying thing is when someone forwards an email to others with just a question like, “Thoughts?” It takes the sender only a few seconds to write, but it can waste a lot of time for others who have to think of a good answer. If the sender took a little more time to write a clear message, everyone could save a lot of time. But why do people still send these annoying emails? Because it’s easier for them. It helps them clear their inbox with little effort.\n\nThis idea of taking the easy way out leads to work cultures that avoid the hard work of focusing and planning. In the long run, this hurts real progress and satisfaction. It pushes us toward shallow work, even though our economy values deep, meaningful work more. But this isn’t the only issue; there’s also the constant pressure to be “productive,” which we’ll talk about next.\n\nBeing a professor at a research university has its challenges, but one good thing is that it’s clear how well you’re doing. You can measure your success by asking one simple question: Are you publishing important papers? This can even be summed up in a single number, like the h-index, which helps show your impact in research. \n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Businesses often choose easy tasks over meaningful work, like unnecessary meetings and vague emails, which waste time and reduce productivity. This trend leads to shallow work, even though deeper work is more valuable. In academia, success can be measured clearly by the number of important papers published.",
