  "simplified_text": "Soon after I met Grant, I started thinking about my own schoolwork, so I asked him how he gets so much done. Luckily, he was cool with sharing his ideas. Grant really thinks about how to be super productive. He even sent me some PowerPoint slides from a workshop he went to with other professors. This workshop was all about using data to figure out how to get academic work done faster and better. The slides had pie charts showing how he spends his time each season, a flowchart about building relationships with co-authors, and a reading list with over twenty books. These business professors aren’t just the typical forgetful academics lost in their books; they see productivity as a problem to solve, and Grant seems to have nailed it.\n\nEven though Grant’s productivity relies on a lot of things, one key idea stands out: he focuses on doing tough but important work in long, uninterrupted blocks of time. He does this in different ways. For example, during the fall semester, he focuses all his energy on teaching, which helps him be available for his students. This method works well since he’s the top-rated teacher at Wharton and has won several teaching awards. By concentrating on teaching in the fall, he can then switch gears and focus on research in the spring and summer without many distractions.\n\nGrant also manages his time on a smaller scale. During a semester dedicated to research, he mixes times when his door is open for students and colleagues with times when he shuts himself off to fully focus on one research project. He usually breaks down writing a paper into three steps: analyzing data, writing a draft, and editing it for publication. When he’s in these focused periods, which can last three or four days, he even sets an out-of-office message on his email so people know he won’t reply right away. He says it sometimes confuses his colleagues because they see him in his office, but for Grant, it’s crucial to stay focused until he finishes his work.\n\nI think Adam Grant doesn’t work a lot more hours than other professors at top research schools, who often tend to overwork themselves. Yet, he still gets way more done than almost anyone else in his field. I believe his batching approach helps explain this. By concentrating his work into intense, distraction-free bursts, he’s able to achieve more.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Adam Grant shares his productivity secrets, focusing on batching work into long, distraction-free periods. He balances teaching and research effectively, allowing him to achieve more than most professors without working extra hours.",
