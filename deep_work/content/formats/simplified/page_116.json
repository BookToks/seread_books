So, he should focus more on writing the best book possible rather than trying to get a few extra sales through less effective ways. Basically, it’s not about whether Twitter helps Lewis; it’s about whether using Twitter really helps him with his most important work tasks.\n\nWhat about a writer who isn’t as famous? For them, marketing their book might be more important. But if we think about what really helps them reach their goals, it’s unlikely that sending quick messages on Twitter would be on that list. Here’s why: Imagine this writer sends ten personal tweets every day, five days a week, connecting with new potential readers. If half of those people become loyal fans who buy the writer’s next book, that’s about two thousand sales over two years. That’s not a huge boost when bestsellers need way more sales each week. So again, it’s not about whether Twitter has some benefits, but if those benefits are worth the time and focus it takes away from writing.\n\nNow that we’ve looked at how this works in a professional setting, let’s think about personal goals, especially with something like Facebook. When people talk about why they use Facebook or similar social networks, they usually mention how important it is for their social lives. So, let’s see if Facebook really helps with personal goals. For example, let’s say the goal is to keep close and meaningful friendships with important people in our lives.\n\nKey Activities Supporting This Goal:\n1. Regularly spend time connecting with those who matter most. \n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how important it is for writers to focus on their main goals, like writing great books, rather than getting distracted by social media. It also examines how social networks like Facebook can impact personal relationships and whether they truly help maintain meaningful friendships.",
