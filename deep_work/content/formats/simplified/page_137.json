(The tips before and after this will help you reach this goal.)\n\nFor most people in regular jobs that need some skills, the answer to the question will usually be between 30 to 50 percent. People don’t like the idea of spending most of their time on easy tasks, so 50 percent feels like a natural limit. At the same time, most bosses will start to worry if you spend less than 30 percent of your time on important tasks because they don’t want you to become someone who thinks a lot but doesn’t reply to emails.\n\nFollowing this budget will probably mean you have to change how you work. You’ll likely need to say no to projects that seem pointless and cut down on the pointless stuff in your current projects. This budget might make you skip weekly meetings and focus more on getting results instead (“just tell me when you’ve made real progress; then we’ll talk”). It might also mean you spend more mornings without distractions or realize that you don’t need to reply quickly and in detail to every email you get.\n\nThese changes are good for making deep work a big part of your job. They don’t ask you to give up your basic tasks, which could cause problems and make people mad, since you’ll still spend a lot of time on those. But they do make you set a clear limit on how many less important tasks you let sneak into your schedule. This limit gives you more time for serious work regularly.\n\nThe reason you should start by talking to your boss is that this agreement gives you support at work. If you work for someone else, this plan helps you when you say no to a task or change a project to make it less pointless. You can explain that it’s necessary to reach your target mix of work types. As I mentioned before, part of why we have so much shallow work in skilled jobs is that we don’t see how it affects our schedules. We usually look at these tasks one by one, and each one seems okay at the moment. But the tools from earlier in this rule help you show the real impact. You can confidently tell your boss, “This is the exact percentage of my time spent last week on shallow work,” and make them approve that ratio. When they see these numbers and understand how wasteful it is to pay someone for shallow work, it becomes clearer.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sticking to a budget for your work time is crucial. Aim for 30-50% on important tasks and communicate with your boss to get support. This helps you focus on deep work while managing shallow tasks effectively.",
