  "simplified_text": "Chappell started by trying to commit to deep work, which means focusing really hard on tasks. He made a rule to work in ninety-minute blocks because he knew it takes time to really concentrate. He planned to fit these blocks into his schedule whenever he could. But, this plan didn’t help him be very productive. The year before, during a dissertation boot camp, he wrote a whole chapter in just one week of focused work. After starting his full-time job, he only managed to write one more chapter in his first year.\n\nThe slow progress made him switch to a new method called the rhythmic approach. He decided to wake up at five-thirty every morning to work. He would write until seven-thirty, then have breakfast and go to work, already done with his dissertation for the day. Happy with his progress, he even started waking up at four-forty-five to get more done in the morning.\n\nWhen I talked to Chappell for this book, he said his rhythmic way of scheduling deep work was “super productive and guilt-free.” He was writing four to five pages every day and could finish a chapter every two or three weeks, which is amazing for someone with a nine-to-five job. He thought, “Why can’t I be this productive? Why not me?”\n\nThe rhythmic method is different from another method called bimodal. While bimodal aims for really intense focus during long sessions, rhythmic works better with how people actually are. By sticking to solid routines, rhythmic schedulers often get more deep work hours in a year.\n\nChoosing between rhythmic and bimodal depends on how good you are at managing your time. If you’re someone like Carl Jung, who’s in a big debate with Sigmund Freud’s followers, you’ll find time to focus on your ideas easily. But if you’re writing a dissertation without anyone pushing you, the regular habits of the rhythmic method might be what you need to keep making progress.\n\nFor many people, it’s not just about self-control; some jobs don’t let you just disappear to focus. \n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Chappell struggled with productivity until he adopted a rhythmic approach to deep work, waking up early to write consistently. This method helped him produce more work while balancing a full-time job, showing that solid routines can lead to greater success.",
