This means setting aside a specific time, usually one day a week, where you don’t use any technology. Just like the Sabbath in the Hebrew Bible is a time for quiet and reflection to appreciate God, the Internet Sabbath is meant to help you notice what you miss when you’re always on your screen.\n\nIt’s not clear who came up with the idea of the Internet Sabbath, but a journalist named William Powers helped make it popular in his 2010 book, *Hamlet’s BlackBerry*. In an interview, Powers said, “Do what Thoreau did, which is learn to have a little disconnectedness within the connected world—don’t run away.”\n\nA lot of advice about dealing with distractions suggests finding some time away from all the noise. Some people take a month or two off each year, while others follow Powers's idea of taking one day a week. Some even set aside an hour or two every day for this. While these ideas can help, if we think about distractions in terms of how our brains work, it’s clear that just doing an Internet Sabbath won’t fix a distracted brain. If you only eat healthy food one day a week, you probably won’t lose weight because you spend the rest of the week overeating. The same goes for distractions; if you only resist them one day a week, you won’t really reduce your brain’s craving for them.\n\nI have a different idea instead of the Internet Sabbath. Instead of planning breaks from distractions to focus better, you should plan breaks from focusing to enjoy distractions. To make this clearer, let’s say using the Internet means looking for distractions. (You can use the Internet in a focused way, but that’s tough for someone who’s addicted to distractions.) Also, let’s say working without the Internet means you’re more focused. (Sure, you can find distractions without the Internet, but those are usually easier to resist.)\n\nWith these ideas in mind, here’s the plan: decide ahead of time when you’ll use the Internet, and avoid it completely outside of those times. I suggest keeping a notepad next to your computer at work.

While this can help, it won't fully solve distraction issues. Instead, the author suggests planning specific times for Internet use and avoiding it outside those times to improve focus.",
