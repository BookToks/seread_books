  "text": "To create a fulfilling work life, it's important to experience \"flow,\" which comes from doing deep, focused work. \n\nNow, let’s talk about why depth and meaning are connected. We need to look at this from a different angle, not just through science, but also through philosophy. Two experts in this area are Hubert Dreyfus, who taught philosophy at Berkeley for over 40 years, and Sean Dorrance Kelly, who leads Harvard's philosophy department. In 2011, they wrote a book called *All Things Shining*, which talks about how ideas of meaning and sacredness have changed throughout history. They wrote this book because they are concerned about where we are headed today.\n\nDreyfus and Kelly say, “The world used to be filled with sacred, shining things,” but now those things feel far away. So, what changed? According to them, it all started with a philosopher named Descartes. His ideas made people believe that finding truth on their own was more important than what God or a king said. This led to the Enlightenment, which brought about human rights and helped many people escape oppression. But Dreyfus and Kelly point out that while this was good politically, it took away the sense of order and sacredness that helps us find meaning in life. Now, we have to figure out what is meaningful and what isn’t, which can feel random and lead to feelings of emptiness. They warn that this way of thinking can make life not just boring, but almost unbearable.\n\nAt first, this might seem unrelated to our search for deep satisfaction, but when we look at Dreyfus and Kelly’s solution, we can find valuable insights about what gives our work meaning. Their answer to the emptiness we feel today connects back to something we talked about earlier: craftsmanship. Dreyfus and Kelly believe that being skilled at something can help us rediscover a sense of sacredness in a good way.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how deep work leads to satisfaction and explores the connection between depth and meaning through philosophy. Dreyfus and Kelly argue that craftsmanship can help restore a sense of sacredness in our lives, addressing modern feelings of emptiness."
