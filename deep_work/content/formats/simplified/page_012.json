  "simplified_text": "During my college years, I shared an office with a super smart professor who won a big award called the MacArthur “genius grant.” He got hired at MIT when he was really young, even before he could legally drink. It was pretty normal to see him in the common area, just staring at a whiteboard with a group of other scholars quietly watching him. Sometimes, this would go on for hours. I’d go to lunch and come back, and he’d still be staring. This professor is tough to get in touch with. He doesn’t use Twitter, and if you don’t know him, he probably won’t reply to your emails. Last year, he published sixteen papers.\n\nThis kind of deep focus was everywhere during my time as a student. So, I started to focus deeply too. My friends and the publicists I worked with on my books were not happy about it, but I’ve never had a Facebook or Twitter account, or any social media besides a blog. I don’t really browse the internet and get most of my news from the Washington Post and NPR that I have delivered to my home. I’m also not easy to reach: my author website doesn’t have a personal email, and I didn’t get my first smartphone until 2012 when my pregnant wife told me I needed one before our son was born.\n\nOn the flip side, my focus on deep work has really paid off. In the ten years after I graduated, I published four books, earned a PhD, wrote a lot of academic papers, and became a professor at Georgetown University. I managed to do all this while usually finishing work by five or six p.m. during the week.\n\nI can keep this busy schedule because I work hard to avoid distractions and make the most of my time. I plan my days around important deep work, and I only do the less important stuff when I really have to, in short bursts. Spending three to four hours a day, five days a week, focused on deep work can lead to a lot of great results.\n\nMy focus on deep work has also helped me in my personal life. Most of the time, I don’t use a computer after I get home from work until the next morning. The only exception is when I write blog posts after my kids go to bed. This way, I can really be present with my family instead of constantly checking work emails or scrolling through social media.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The author shares their experience of focusing deeply on work and avoiding distractions during college and their career. This commitment led to significant achievements while allowing them to maintain a balanced personal life, especially with family.",
