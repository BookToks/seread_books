  "simplified_text": "Your brain can actually remember a lot of details if you store them the right way. Ron White has a cool technique for memorizing cards that uses this idea.\n\nFirst, he suggests you picture walking through five rooms in your house. You might start at the front door, go through the hallway, then into the bathroom, out to the guest bedroom, into the kitchen, and finally down to the basement. In each room, think of clear images of what you see.\n\nOnce you can easily remember this mental tour, pick ten big items in each room. White says to choose things like a desk instead of something small like a pencil. Then, decide the order you’ll look at these items. For example, in the hallway, you might first see the entry mat, then the shoes by it, then the bench above the shoes, and so on. That gives you fifty items, so add two more from your backyard to reach fifty-two, which you'll need for the cards.\n\nPractice this mental exercise of walking through the rooms and looking at the items in the right order. You’ll find this way of memorizing is much easier than just trying to memorize things by repeating them, like in school.\n\nThe next step is to connect a memorable person or thing to each of the fifty-two cards. Make sure there’s a logical link between the card and the image. For example, you could think of Donald Trump when you see the King of Diamonds since diamonds represent wealth. Keep practicing these connections until you can pull a card from the deck and instantly remember the associated image. Using memorable visuals makes this task easier.\n\nThe first two steps are things you do just once, and then you can use them over and over when memorizing different decks. After that, you’re ready for the main part: memorizing the order of fifty-two cards in a shuffled deck as fast as you can. Start your mental walk-through again. As you see each item, look at the next card from the shuffled deck and imagine the memorable person or thing doing something near that item.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Ron White’s card memorization technique helps you remember details by visualizing a walk through your home and associating memorable images with cards. By practicing these steps, you can quickly memorize the order of a shuffled deck.",
