  "simplified_text": "Inventor Jorge Hirsch created a way to measure how much impact someone has in their field by looking at their publication and citation counts. For example, in computer science, having an h-index score over 40 is really impressive and shows a strong career. But if your h-index is low when you’re up for a job promotion, that could be a problem. Google Scholar, a tool that helps people find research papers, even tracks your h-index automatically, so you can see how you’re doing all the time. (By the way, as I write this, my score is 21.)\n\nThis makes it easier for professors to decide how to spend their time. The famous physicist Richard Feynman once talked about how he worked. He said to do great physics, you need long, focused time. If you’re busy with other tasks, you won’t have that time. So, he pretended to be irresponsible. He would say no to extra jobs, like being on committees, because he wanted to focus on doing good physics work. Feynman probably wasn’t great at replying to emails and would likely change schools if someone tried to make him work in an office or tweet. Knowing what’s important helps you see what’s not.\n\nI mention professors because they are a bit different from most workers, who often don’t know how well they’re doing. Social critic Matthew Crawford talked about how managers feel confused and anxious about their jobs. He was specifically talking about middle managers in knowledge work, but this confusion applies to many jobs. In his book, \"Shop Class as Soulcraft,\" Crawford quit his job at a think tank to open a motorcycle repair shop. He wanted to escape that confusion. Fixing a broken bike and then seeing it work again gave him a clear sign that he had succeeded.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how Jorge Hirsch's h-index measures academic impact, highlighting the importance of focus in work, as shown by physicist Richard Feynman. It also touches on the confusion many workers feel about their performance, with Crawford's experience illustrating the value of tangible results.",
