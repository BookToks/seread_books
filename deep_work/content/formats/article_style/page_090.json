  "simplified_text": "I start by quickly looking over all my tasks and checking my calendar for the next few days. This helps me make sure I’m not forgetting anything important or any deadlines that are coming up. By this point, I’ve looked at everything I need to do for work. To finish this routine, I use what I’ve reviewed to make a rough plan for the next day. Once I have my plan, I say, “Shutdown complete,” and I’m done thinking about work for the day.\n\nThe idea of a shutdown ritual might sound a bit much at first, but it’s actually really helpful because of something called the Zeigarnik effect. This effect, named after a psychologist named Bluma Zeigarnik, explains how unfinished tasks can keep bothering us. If you just stop working at five p.m. and say, “I’m done until tomorrow,” you might find it hard to stop thinking about work. All the tasks you didn’t finish will keep fighting for your attention all evening, and they usually win.\n\nAt first, this might seem impossible to deal with. Anyone who has a busy job knows there are always things left to do. The idea that you can finish everything is just a dream. Luckily, you don’t have to finish a task to stop thinking about it. A psychologist named Roy Baumeister, along with E.J. Masicampo, did a study called “Consider It Done!” They found that if you make a plan for how to finish a task after being interrupted, it can help clear your mind. Their research showed that making a specific plan not only helps you reach your goal but also frees up your brain for other things.\n\nThe shutdown ritual I mentioned earlier uses this idea to fight the Zeigarnik effect. While it doesn’t require you to make a plan for every single task (which would be too much), it does make you list all your tasks and review them before planning for the next day. This routine makes sure you won’t forget anything: you’ll look at each task every day and handle them when it’s the right time. So, your mind doesn’t have to keep track of everything all the time—your shutdown ritual takes care of that.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage explains a shutdown ritual that helps manage work tasks and reduce stress. It discusses the Zeigarnik effect, which shows how unfinished tasks can distract us. By planning for the next day, we can clear our minds and stay focused.",
