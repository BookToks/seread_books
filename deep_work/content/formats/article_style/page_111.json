  "simplified_text": "The farm is moving away from regular crops and focusing on a newer idea called grass-finished meat. Instead of selling their steaks in stores like Whole Foods, Smith Meadows sells directly to customers at busy farmers' markets in the Washington, D.C., area. The farm is doing well in a business that usually doesn’t support small farms.\n\nI first met Pritchard at our local farmers' market in Takoma Park, Maryland, where Smith Meadows has a popular stand. Pritchard is usually taller than most of his customers and wears the typical faded flannel shirt of a farmer. He seems really confident in what he does. I wanted to talk to him because farming is all about using tools wisely, and I was curious about how someone in this old-school job handles that.\n\n“Making hay is a great example,” he said during one of our chats. “I can explain it without getting too complicated about the money side of things.” When Pritchard took over Smith Meadows, the farm made its own hay to feed animals in winter when they can’t graze. They use a hay baler, which is a machine that attaches to a tractor and turns dried grass into bales. If you have animals on the East Coast, you need hay. Why spend money on feed when you have grass growing for free? If a farmer thought simply, they would definitely buy a hay baler.\n\nBut Pritchard told me that if a farmer thought like that, “I’d be counting the days until the ‘For Sale’ sign goes up on the property.” Instead, he thinks more deeply about the tools he needs. After considering the hay baler, Pritchard decided to sell it and now buys all the hay they use.\n\nHere’s why he made that choice. “Let’s look at the costs of making hay,” Pritchard explained. “First, there’s the cost of fuel, repairs, and a shed to store the baler. You also have to pay taxes on it.” These costs were easy to figure out. But the “opportunity costs” were trickier. He said, “If I spend all summer making hay, I can’t do anything else. Now, I use that time to raise chickens for meat, which brings in more money.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Smith Meadows farm focuses on grass-finished meat and sells directly to customers at farmers' markets. Pritchard, the farmer, decided to buy hay instead of making it himself to save time and make more money by raising chickens.",
