At the beginning of her career, she tried to fit work into every spare moment from seven in the morning until midnight. Since she has kids, her evenings were often really busy. It didn’t take long for her to realize that this way of working wasn’t going to work, so she decided to limit herself to fifty hours a week. She then figured out what rules and habits she needed to stick to this limit. In other words, she used a fixed-schedule approach to get things done.\n\nThis strategy clearly worked for her career because she earned tenure on time and became a full professor just three years later, which is pretty impressive. How did she do it? According to her article, one key way she respected her time limit was by setting strict limits on less important tasks in her academic life. For example, she decided to only travel five times a year for any reason, since trips can create a lot of urgent but unimportant tasks, like booking hotels or preparing talks. While five trips might seem like a lot, it’s actually pretty light for someone in academia. To make this point clearer, a former colleague of hers at Harvard, Matt Welsh, once wrote that new professors often travel twelve to twenty-four times a year. (Think about how many less important tasks Nagpal avoided by skipping an extra ten to fifteen trips!) The travel limit is just one of the ways Nagpal managed her workday. She also set limits on how many papers she would review each year. All her methods focused on cutting down on less important work while protecting the time for deep, meaningful research that really mattered for her career.\n\nIn my own experience, I also stick to a similar approach to succeed with fixed scheduling. I’m very careful about using the word “yes,” which can be dangerous for productivity. It takes a lot to get me to agree to something that leads to unimportant work. If someone asks me to help with university stuff that isn’t super important, I might say, “Talk to me after tenure.” Another trick that helps me is being clear when I say no but not going into too much detail about why. The key is to avoid giving too much information about my reasons.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Nagpal chose to prioritize her happiness by limiting her work hours and avoiding unnecessary tasks. She set strict travel limits and focused on meaningful research, which helped her succeed in her academic career. Similarly, I also carefully manage my commitments to stay productive.",
