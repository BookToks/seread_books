  "simplified_text": "The part about Thurston’s Twitter use talks about some tweets he made on March 13, 2014, from the account @Baratunde. He said, “Entertainment was my initial draw,” “When I first joined,” and “I use Facebook because.” These came from comments on two blog posts I wrote in the fall of 2013. The posts are called “Why I’m (Still) Not Going to Join Facebook: Four Arguments That Failed to Convince Me” and “Why I Never Joined Facebook.” You can find them online.\n\nThere’s also a mention of Forrest Pritchard and Smith Meadows Farms, which you can check out at their website. The “Law of the Vital Few” is about how to manage your time online. Malcolm Gladwell talked about how not everyone wants to hear from their favorite people during a speech at a big book event in New York in May 2013. You can read a summary of that talk online.\n\nIn an interview, Michael Lewis said, “I don’t tweet,” and “It’s amazing how overly accessible.” David Carr wrote in January 2010 that “Twitter is crack for media addicts.” The “law of the vital few” idea is discussed in many books. Richard Koch’s book, The 80/20 Principle, helped bring this idea back into business talk. Tim Ferriss’s book, The 4-Hour Workweek, made it popular with tech entrepreneurs. You can find a good summary of this idea on Wikipedia.\n\nThe section about quitting social media mentions that “Everything’s more exciting when it’s a party,” which relates to Ryan Nicodemus’s “packing party.” There’s a stat that says the average Twitter user is an American woman with an iPhone and 208 followers. But this number can be misleading because a few users have a lot of followers, making the average seem higher. If we only look at people who actually tweet and want followers, the numbers would be different.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses various thoughts on social media, including tweets from Thurston and Malcolm Gladwell's insights. It highlights the \"Law of the Vital Few\" and mentions the average Twitter user. Overall, it emphasizes how social media can be misleading and suggests being mindful of online habits.",
