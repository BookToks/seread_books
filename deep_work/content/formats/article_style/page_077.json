  "simplified_text": "the construction of a new lab was designed to make scientists and engineers interact more. Kelly didn’t like the usual way universities separate departments into different buildings. Instead, he created one big space connected by long hallways—some so long that if you stood at one end, it looked like it disappeared into the distance. Jon Gertner, who writes about Bell Labs, said that walking down those halls without running into friends, problems, or new ideas was almost impossible. A physicist going to lunch was like a magnet attracting iron filings.\n\nThis plan, along with Kelly’s push to hire some of the smartest people, led to amazing innovations. After World War II, the lab created many important things, like the first solar cell, laser, communication satellite, cellular system, and fiber optic networking. They also developed information theory and coding theory, won a Nobel Prize for proving the Big Bang Theory, and invented the transistor, which is super important.\n\nThe idea of “serendipitous creativity” seems to be true based on history. The invention of the transistor likely needed Bell Labs, where solid-state physicists, quantum theorists, and top experimentalists could meet and learn from each other. This kind of invention probably wouldn’t happen with just one scientist working alone in a quiet place.\n\nBut we need to understand more about what really sparked innovation at places like Building 20 and Bell Labs. Let’s look at my own experience at MIT. When I started as a new PhD student in 2004, I was in the first class to use the new Stata Center, which replaced Building 20. Since it was new, we got tours that showed off its features. Frank Gehry, the architect, designed the offices around shared spaces and added open stairways to encourage those chance meetings that were so important in the old building. However, what surprised me was a feature that Gehry hadn’t thought of but was added because the faculty wanted it: special gaskets in the office doors to make them soundproof. The professors at MIT, who are some of the most creative tech experts, didn’t want an open-office style. They wanted the option to close their doors.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The new lab was designed to encourage interaction among scientists and engineers. This led to major innovations like the transistor. However, at MIT, professors preferred soundproof offices over open spaces, showing that collaboration also needs privacy.",
