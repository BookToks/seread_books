  "simplified_text": "There are two companies involved here. People in high positions, like CEOs, often struggle to focus deeply because their jobs are super distracting. For instance, Kerry Trainor, the CEO of Vimeo, says he can go a whole Saturday without checking his email, but he still looks at it during the day. \n\nThese executives get paid really well and are more important to the economy than ever before. Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter, is another example of someone who finds success without deep focus. However, just because these leaders can handle distractions doesn’t mean that deep thinking isn’t valuable. The reason they have to deal with so many distractions is because of their specific jobs. A good CEO is like a smart computer that makes tough decisions based on their experience and instincts. They get a lot of information throughout the day, like emails and meetings, that they need to process quickly. It wouldn’t make sense to ask a CEO to spend hours thinking about one problem; it’s better for them to have smart team members do that and then present solutions for the CEO to decide on.\n\nThis is important because if you’re a high-level executive, the advice in this book might not apply to you. But it also means you can’t assume that what works for these executives will work for everyone else. Just because Dorsey likes interruptions or Trainor checks his email often doesn’t mean you’ll be successful if you do the same. Their habits are specific to their jobs.\n\nWe should remember that there are parts of the economy where deep thinking isn’t as valued. Besides CEOs, this includes some salespeople and lobbyists who need to stay connected all the time. Some people can still succeed while being distracted, even if deep thinking would help them. \n\nBut don’t rush to think your job can’t involve deep work. Just because your current habits make it hard to focus doesn’t mean you can’t do your job well. In the next chapter, I’ll explain more about this.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how high-level executives like CEOs often deal with distractions and don’t focus deeply, yet their roles require quick decision-making. It emphasizes that their habits may not apply to everyone and that deep work can still be valuable in many jobs.",
