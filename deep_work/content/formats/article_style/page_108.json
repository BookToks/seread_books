  "simplified_text": "Before you start working on something important, it's easy to get distracted by all the apps and websites around you. Your willpower can only handle so much, and if you have too many things grabbing your attention, it becomes tough to focus. To really get good at deep work, you need to take control of your time and attention away from these distractions.\n\nBut before we tackle these distractions, we need to understand the situation better. Baratunde Thurston's experience shows us how confused many people feel about the impact of online tools on their focus. He got so overwhelmed that he thought the only way to deal with it was to quit the Internet for a while. This idea of taking a break from the Internet has become a popular topic in our culture.\n\nThe problem with thinking you can only quit the Internet or keep being distracted is that these choices are too simple. Quitting the Internet isn't realistic for most people, especially if you need it for work or school. Even though Thurston learned a lot during his break, he quickly fell back into his old distracted habits once he returned online. Just six months after his break, he was already tweeting a lot again.\n\nThis rule suggests a better way: recognize that not all online tools are bad. Some can actually help you succeed and be happy. But you should be careful about how much time you give to these tools and limit the number you use. I’m not saying you should quit the Internet like Thurston did, but I do want you to fight against being constantly distracted. There’s a balance to find, and if you want to get better at deep work, you need to work towards that balance.\n\nOur first step in finding this balance is to choose the right online tools wisely. \n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To focus better, you need to control your time and attention away from distractions. Quitting the Internet isn't realistic for most, but finding a balance with online tools can help you succeed. Focus on using fewer tools that truly benefit you.",
