They make a big mistake when they waste their free time online instead of doing something better. During the sixteen hours they have off, they could be using their energy for more important things.\n\nIn summer, people should enjoy the nice weather. Jason Fried, who moved his company to a four-day workweek, believes this too. He talks about how packing 40 hours of work into just four days can be tough. Some people think a four-day workweek doesn’t work, but Fried explains that the idea is to make work more efficient. He believes most people don’t even work a full eight hours each day.\n\nFried also mentions that he would prefer to work five days straight if it meant getting more done. He shares how his company can afford to give employees time off. Research shows that with focused practice, people can become experts in their fields.\n\nSchedule Every Minute of Your Day\n\nStatistics show that people in Britain spend a lot of time either online or watching TV. An article from the Guardian compares these habits. Laura Vanderkam wrote about how people often think they work more than they really do. \n\nFinish Your Work by Five Thirty\n\nThere are many scary myths about work habits. Radhika Nagpal talks about how she stays productive by sticking to a fixed schedule. Matt Welsh shares his thoughts on how junior faculty members often travel a lot for work.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how people waste their free time online instead of being productive. It highlights the benefits of a four-day workweek and the importance of scheduling time wisely to improve efficiency and work-life balance.",
