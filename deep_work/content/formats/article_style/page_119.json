It’s like a game where you can only win by focusing on what matters most. \n\nIn the business world, people get this idea. Companies often let go of clients that don’t make them much money. If 80% of their profits come from just 20% of their clients, it makes sense for them to spend more time on the clients that bring in the most cash. The same idea applies to your own goals. If you spend less time on low-impact stuff, like scrolling through social media, and more time on high-impact activities, like hanging out with a good friend, you’ll achieve your goals faster. \n\nSo, if you decide to stop using a tool that doesn’t help you much, you’re not missing out on something great. Instead, you’re freeing up time to focus on what really matters. For writers like Malcolm Gladwell, Michael Lewis, and George Packer, using Twitter doesn’t help them succeed in their careers. Even if Twitter has some small benefits, they’re likely better off without it, using that time for more important things. You should think carefully about which tools you let take up your time and attention.\n\nWhen Ryan Nicodemus wanted to make his life simpler, he started with his stuff. He lived alone in a big three-bedroom condo and had been trying to fill it with things for years. But now, he wanted to take back control from all his possessions. His plan was simple but bold. He spent a day packing everything he owned into boxes, almost like he was moving. To make it more fun, he called it a “packing party,” saying, “Everything’s more exciting when it’s a party, right?”\n\nAfter packing, Ryan spent the next week going through his things. \n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses the importance of focusing on high-impact activities over low-impact ones, both in business and personal life. It highlights how letting go of unproductive tools, like social media, can lead to greater success and fulfillment. Ryan Nicodemus's story illustrates simplifying life by decluttering possessions.",
