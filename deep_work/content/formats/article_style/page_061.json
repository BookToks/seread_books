It’s the only way he can make progress on his dissertation since he has limited time. Chappell said that when he first learned about deep work, it was a big moment for him.\n\nI mention these examples because even though Knuth and Chappell both think deep work is important, they have different ideas about how to fit it into their work lives. Knuth uses a strict method that focuses on deep work by trying to cut out all other distractions. On the other hand, Chappell has a routine where he works every weekday morning from five to seven-thirty without fail, before starting his day filled with regular distractions. Both methods work, but they don’t work for everyone. Knuth’s way might be good for someone whose job is mainly about thinking deeply, but if Chappell tried to ignore all distractions like Knuth, he might end up losing his job.\n\nYou need to find your own way to include deep work in your professional life. Trying to fit deep work into your schedule randomly isn’t a good way to manage your limited focus. This example shows that you need to choose a method that fits your situation, or it could mess up your deep work habit before it even starts. I’ll share four different ways to schedule deep work that I’ve seen work really well. The goal is to show you that there are many ways to fit deep work into your life, so it’s worth taking the time to find what works for you.\n\nLet’s go back to Donald Knuth. He’s well-known for many important ideas in computer science, especially for creating a detailed way to analyze how algorithms work. However, Knuth is also known for his unusual approach to email. If you visit his website at Stanford looking for his email address, you’ll find a note that says:\n\n“I have been a happy man ever since January 1, 1990, when I no longer had an email address. I’d used email since about 1975, and it seems to me that 15...”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses the importance of deep work and how different people, like Brian Chappell and Donald Knuth, integrate it into their lives. It emphasizes finding a personal approach that fits individual circumstances to effectively manage deep work habits.",
