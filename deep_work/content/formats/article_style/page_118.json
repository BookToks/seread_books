  "text": "You might feel frustrated that only a few activities seem to matter when deciding how to use certain tools. For example, Facebook has a lot of good things for your social life. So, why would you stop using it just because it doesn’t help with the few activities you think are the most important? The important thing to realize is that focusing on just a few priorities isn’t random; it’s based on a common idea found in different areas, like business profits, social fairness, and computer problems.\n\nThis idea is called the Law of the Vital Few. It means that in many situations, 80% of the results come from just 20% of the causes. For instance, a business might get 80% of its profits from only 20% of its customers, or a country’s wealth might be held by just 20% of its richest people. Also, 80% of software crashes might come from only 20% of the bugs. There’s math behind this idea, but it’s most helpful as a reminder that not all contributions are equal.\n\nNow, let’s think about this law when it comes to your goals in life. Many activities can help you reach your goals, but the Law of the Vital Few tells us that the most important 20% of those activities will give you the most benefits. If you can think of about ten to fifteen activities that could help you, this law suggests that focusing on the top two or three will make the biggest difference in whether you succeed.\n\nEven if you agree with this idea, you might think it’s still okay to pay attention to the other 80% of activities that could help. While it’s true that these less important activities don’t help as much as the top ones, they can still offer some benefits. So, why not keep them around? However, this thinking misses a key point: all activities, no matter how important, use up your limited time and attention. If you spend too much time on less important activities, you might not have enough left for the ones that really matter.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage explains that focusing on a few key activities can lead to the best results in achieving goals. It highlights the Law of the Vital Few, which states that 80% of outcomes come from just 20% of causes. While less important activities can still help, they shouldn’t take away time from the most impactful ones."
