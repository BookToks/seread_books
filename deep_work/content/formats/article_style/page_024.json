  "simplified_text": "To really learn something new, like a complicated skill (for example, managing a SQL database), you need to focus without distractions. If you’re trying to learn while scrolling through your Facebook feed, your brain is all over the place. This makes it hard to strengthen the specific group of brain cells you need to learn effectively.\n\nA long time ago, a guy named Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges talked about using your mind like a lens to focus your attention. Now, we understand this better through science, specifically looking at how certain brain cells work. The main point is clear: to learn tough things fast, you have to concentrate deeply without getting distracted. If you can do this, you’ll be better at mastering the complex skills needed to succeed today. But if you find it hard to focus and are always distracted, don’t expect to pick up these skills easily.\n\nAdam Grant is a great example of someone who produces amazing work. When I met him in 2013, he was the youngest professor to get tenure at the Wharton School of Business. By the time I started writing this chapter, he had become the youngest full professor there.\n\nThe reason Grant moved up so quickly is simple: he gets a lot done. In 2012, he published seven articles in big journals, which is a crazy amount for his field. In 2013, he published five articles, which is still impressive, but he was also busy writing a bestselling book called *Give and Take*. This book was a huge hit, even making the cover of the New York Times Magazine. By 2014, when he became a full professor, he had already written over sixty research papers and his bestselling book.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To learn complex skills quickly, you need to focus deeply without distractions. Adam Grant is a prime example of someone who excels in academia by producing a lot of quality work, including a bestselling book. His success shows the importance of deep work in mastering skills.",
