You’ll probably see at least twenty cars in the parking lot. Inside, there will be a bunch of people studying texts—some reading quietly, whispering words from an old language, while others are debating in pairs. At one end of the room, a rabbi will be leading a larger group discussion. This early morning meeting is just a small part of the hundreds of thousands of Orthodox Jews who wake up early every weekday to study the important writings of their faith.  \n\nI learned about this from Adam Marlin, a member of the Knesses Yisroel congregation and a regular at the morning study group. Marlin told me he aims to understand one page of the Talmud each day, although he sometimes doesn’t make it. He often studies with a partner to help push his understanding to the limit.  \n\nWhat I find interesting about Marlin isn’t just what he knows, but the effort it takes to learn it. When I talked to him, he highlighted how intense his morning routine is. “It’s a serious discipline, mostly about the ‘deep work’ stuff you write about,” he said. “I run a growing business, but this is often the hardest mental challenge I face.” This challenge isn’t just Marlin’s experience; it’s part of the practice itself.
