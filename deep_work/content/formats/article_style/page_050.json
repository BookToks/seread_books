Basically, I’ll live a focused life because it’s the best way to live.” We should really take her advice.\n\nA Psychological Argument for Depth\n\nThe second reason why focusing deeply on things gives our lives meaning comes from a famous psychologist named Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. Back in the 1980s, he teamed up with a younger colleague, Reed Larson, at the University of Chicago to create a new way to understand how our everyday actions affect our feelings. Before this, it was hard to measure how different activities impacted our minds. If you asked someone in a lab to remember how they felt hours ago, they probably wouldn’t remember well. And if you gave them a diary to write in throughout the day, they likely wouldn’t keep it up because it was too much work.\n\nCsikszentmihalyi and Larson came up with a smart solution by using new technology at the time. They gave people pagers that would beep at random times. When the beep happened, the people would write down what they were doing and how they felt right at that moment. Sometimes they used journals, and other times they called a number to answer questions. Because the beeps were random but hard to ignore, people were more likely to follow through. This method, called the experience sampling method (ESM), helped them understand how we really feel during our daily lives.\n\nOne of the big discoveries from Csikszentmihalyi’s work with ESM was that the best moments happen when we push ourselves to do something hard and meaningful. He called this feeling “flow,” which he explained in a book he wrote in 1990. This idea was different from what most people thought. Many believed that relaxing was the key to happiness. We often want to work less and chill more.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Reed Larson created a method to understand how daily activities affect our feelings. They used pagers to prompt people to record their feelings in real-time. Csikszentmihalyi discovered that the best moments happen when we challenge ourselves, a state he called \"flow,\" which contrasts with the common belief that relaxation brings happiness.",
