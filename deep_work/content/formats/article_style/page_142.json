  "simplified_text": "If you follow a fixed schedule for getting things done, you might ignore emails until the next morning. Some people think this could cause issues because quick replies are expected. But just because your boss is checking emails at night doesn’t mean she wants you to reply right away. This strategy will help you learn that.\n\nFixed-schedule productivity is a simple habit to start, but it can really change how you work. If you want to focus more on important tasks, this should be one of the top things you try. If you’re still unsure about how setting limits on your work hours can help you succeed, look at Radhika Nagpal. While Tom was complaining online about his busy job as a young professor, Nagpal was celebrating her achievements, like having her research on the cover of the journal Science, all while sticking to her fixed schedule.\n\nWhen talking about shallow work, we can’t forget about email. Email is a major distraction for many workers because it constantly pulls your attention. We’ve gotten so used to checking emails that we forget we can control how it affects our lives. John Freeman, in his book The Tyranny of E-mail, warns that this technology is making it harder for us to explain why we shouldn’t just accept it and let it take over our days. It feels like we have no choice.\n\nBut you can push back against this feeling of helplessness. Just because you can’t avoid email completely doesn’t mean you have to let it control your time and focus. In the next parts, I’ll share three tips to help you take back control over how email fits into your life. You actually have more power over your email than you might think.\n\nTip #1: Make People Who Send You Emails Do More Work. \n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Fixed-schedule productivity helps you focus on important tasks by limiting work hours. Email can be a big distraction, but you can regain control over it. By using specific strategies, you can manage your time better and reduce interruptions.",
