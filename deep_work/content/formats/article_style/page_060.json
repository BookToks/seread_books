  "simplified_text": "willpower is like a battery that runs out as you use it. You can't just keep pushing yourself without limits. It's like a muscle that gets tired. That's why people in studies had trouble resisting distractions; they used up their willpower until they couldn't fight anymore. This can happen to you too, no matter how good your intentions are—unless you’re smart about your habits.\n\nTo build a strong work habit, you need to go beyond just wanting to do well. You should create routines and rituals that help you focus without using up too much of your willpower. For example, if you try to switch from browsing the web to a hard task in the middle of the day, it will take a lot of willpower to focus. That’s why it often doesn’t work. But if you have a set time and a quiet place for your important tasks, it will be easier to start and keep going. This way, you'll be more successful in doing deep work.\n\nThe six strategies that follow are like tools to help you create these routines and rituals. They are based on the idea that willpower is limited, so they help you get more done. Some will help you focus better before you start working, while others will help recharge your willpower quickly. You could just decide to prioritize deep work, but using these strategies will make it much more likely that you can really make deep work a big part of your life.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Willpower is limited, like a battery that runs out. To succeed in deep work, create smart routines and rituals that help you focus without draining your willpower. The following strategies will help you make deep work a priority in your life.",
