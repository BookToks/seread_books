  "simplified_text": "This setup has soundproof offices connected to big common areas. It creates a mix of quiet thinking and chances to meet others. On one side, you have people working alone, which helps them focus but can cut them off from new ideas. On the other side, you have people working together in open spaces, which sparks creativity but can make it hard to concentrate.\n\nLooking at Building 20 and Bell Labs, they had a similar design. They didn’t have modern open office layouts. Instead, they had private offices linked by shared hallways. This design encouraged researchers to bump into each other when moving around, which helped them share ideas. These long hallways acted like great meeting spots.\n\nSo, we can still say that open offices aren’t the best for deep work, but we shouldn’t ignore the idea that creativity can come from unexpected meetings. The trick is to have a mix: spend time in places where you can share ideas but also have quiet spots to think deeply about what you learn.\n\nHowever, just going back to work alone isn’t always the best choice. For example, the invention of the transistor at Bell Labs involved a big team of researchers with different skills. They worked together in a group focused on creating a smaller, better version of the vacuum tube. Their teamwork was crucial for the invention of the transistor, showing how important collaboration is.\n\nOnce the team laid the groundwork, the innovation moved to a quieter space. But even then, it was still a team effort. Two researchers, Walter Brattain and John Bardeen, worked closely together in a small lab for a month in 1947. They made the breakthroughs that led to the first solid-state transistor.\n\nBrattain and Bardeen often worked side by side during this time, showing how teamwork can lead to amazing inventions.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how a mix of quiet workspaces and common areas can boost creativity. It highlights the importance of collaboration in innovation, using the example of the transistor invention at Bell Labs, where teamwork led to significant breakthroughs.",
