  "simplified_text": "After it was announced that he won the Nobel Prize, journalists couldn't find him. J.K. Rowling, on the other hand, does use a computer, but she stayed off social media while writing her Harry Potter books, even though that was when social media was becoming popular. In the fall of 2009, her team finally made a Twitter account for her while she was working on The Casual Vacancy. For the first year and a half, her only tweet said, “This is the real me, but you won’t be hearing from me often I am afraid, as pen and paper is my priority at the moment.”\n\nDeep work isn’t just for people in the past or those who don’t like technology. Bill Gates, the CEO of Microsoft, used to take “Think Weeks” twice a year. During these weeks, he would go to a quiet place, like a cottage by a lake, to read and think. In 1995, during one of these weeks, he wrote a famous memo about the Internet that got Microsoft interested in a new company called Netscape. In a funny twist, Neal Stephenson, a well-known author who helped shape how we think about the Internet, is hard to reach online. His website doesn’t have an email address and includes an essay explaining why he is not good at social media. He once said that if he can have long, uninterrupted time, he can write novels. But if he gets interrupted a lot, he ends up just sending emails instead of writing something that lasts.\n\nIt’s important to notice that many successful people focus on deep work, which is very different from how most modern workers behave. Many workers today are forgetting how valuable deep work is. The reason for this is clear: network tools. This includes things like email, texting, social media, and websites that entertain us, like BuzzFeed and Reddit. Because of these tools and how easily we can access them on smartphones and computers, many workers find it hard to focus. A study from 2012 showed that the average worker spends over 60% of their workweek on electronic communication and searching the Internet, with almost 30% of their time just reading and replying to emails.\n\nThis split attention makes it hard to do deep work, which needs long periods of focused thinking. However, modern workers...\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how successful people like J.K. Rowling and Bill Gates prioritize deep work, focusing on uninterrupted time to think and create. In contrast, many modern workers struggle to concentrate due to constant distractions from network tools like email and social media.",
