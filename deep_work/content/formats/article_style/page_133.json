  "text": "Before I let you try this strategy, I want to talk about a common concern. When I share the benefits of having a daily schedule, I often hear people say they’re worried it will feel too strict. For instance, a reader named Joseph commented on a blog post I wrote about this. He said he thinks I don’t fully understand how unpredictable life can be. He worries that people might take scheduling too seriously, to the point where they become obsessed with it. This could make them miss out on enjoying activities, especially for artists who often need to go with the flow.\n\nI get where Joseph is coming from, and he’s not the only one who feels this way. But luckily, there’s an easy way to handle these worries. In my daily schedule, I make sure to set aside time for thinking and talking about new ideas. I also have a rule: if I discover something important, I can ignore my schedule for the day (except for things I really can’t skip). I’ll focus on that new idea until I feel like I’ve explored it enough. Then, I can look at what’s left of my day and adjust my schedule.\n\nSo, I not only allow for surprises in my schedule; I actually support them. Joseph’s concern comes from thinking that a schedule is meant to control your actions. But that’s not the point. Scheduling is about being thoughtful. It helps you pause during the day and ask yourself, “What should I do with the time I have left?” It’s this habit of questioning that leads to good results, not just sticking to a strict plan.\n\nI believe that if you mix detailed scheduling with the flexibility to change your plans, you’ll probably have more creative ideas than someone who just goes with the flow and doesn’t plan. Without a plan, it’s easy to waste time on things like emails, social media, or browsing the internet. While these things can feel good in the moment, they don’t help you be creative. Having a structure means you can set aside time to think about new ideas, tackle tough projects, or brainstorm, which is more likely to spark innovation.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** This passage discusses the benefits of having a daily schedule while allowing for flexibility. It addresses concerns about strict planning, emphasizing that thoughtful scheduling can enhance creativity and prevent wasted time on distractions."
