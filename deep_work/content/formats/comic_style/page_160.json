  "simplified_text": "Chapter 2\n\nFacebook has a huge open office space, which is the biggest in the world. Some people wonder if open offices really help people work better or just make them less focused. \n\nSquare, another company, also wants its workers to stay in open areas. They believe it helps with teamwork and communication.\n\nThere’s a New York Times article that talks about how instant messaging is changing the way businesses communicate. It mentions that this new way of chatting is popular among young people and is helping improve productivity.\n\nYou can find more information about Hall, a company that focuses on real-time collaboration, on their website and in a TechCrunch article. They recently raised a lot of money to help with their goals.\n\nThe New York Times has a list of over 800 employees who use Twitter. \n\nJonathan Franzen wrote an article for the Guardian about what he thinks is wrong with the modern world, but it was taken down due to legal issues. A Slate article later discussed Franzen's views on the internet and social media.\n\nJennifer Weiner responded to Franzen, saying he doesn’t understand her perspective. \n\nThere are also studies showing that open offices can be really distracting, especially when you’re trying to focus on work. \n\nSome researchers looked into how people get interrupted while working and found it can make it hard to finish tasks.\n\nGeorge Packer shared his thoughts on social media, comparing Twitter to a drug for media lovers. \n\nTom Cochran did an email experiment and explained that while email seems free, it actually has hidden costs. \n\nLastly, it’s hard to measure how well individuals are doing in this new work environment.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** This chapter discusses how open office spaces at companies like Facebook and Square aim to boost communication and teamwork. It also explores the impact of instant messaging and social media on work, highlighting distractions and challenges in measuring individual productivity.",
