  "text": "Taking breaks in the evening is just as important as walking in nature for your brain. But if you keep checking emails or working on projects after dinner, you're not giving your brain the break it needs. Even if you only spend a little time on work, it stops you from really relaxing. You need to feel like you’re done with work for the day so your brain can start to recharge for tomorrow. If you try to work more in the evenings, you might actually get less done the next day.\n\nNow, let’s talk about why it’s important to stop working at a certain time. Anders Ericsson, who created the idea of deliberate practice, said that this practice helps you get better at skills. Deep work and deliberate practice are similar, and we can think of deliberate practice as any hard mental work. In a paper from 1993, Ericsson explained that beginners can only focus intensely for about an hour a day, while experts can do it for up to four hours, but not much more.\n\nOne study looked at elite violin players in Berlin and found they practiced for about three and a half hours a day, usually in two sessions. Less skilled players practiced less. This shows that there’s a limit to how much deep work you can do in a day. If you plan your time well, you can make the most of your deep work hours.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Taking breaks in the evening is crucial for your brain's recovery. Working late can actually make you less productive the next day. Studies show that there's a limit to how much intense work you can handle each day, so it's important to manage your time wisely."
