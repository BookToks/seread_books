  "simplified_text": "At the start of my postdoc, I was really distracted. I spent a lot of time “thinking” but didn’t get much done. It took me about twelve tries before I started to see real progress. You might go through something similar, so be patient. To help speed things up, I have two tips for you.\n\n**Tip #1: Watch Out for Distractions and Looping**  \nWhen you first try to meditate and think productively, your mind will probably try to distract you with random thoughts that seem more interesting. For me, I often found myself wanting to write an email instead of focusing. Even though writing an email sounds boring, it can feel super tempting in the moment. When you notice your mind wandering, gently remind yourself that you can think about that later and bring your focus back. \n\nDistractions are a big problem when trying to build a good meditation habit. Another sneaky issue is called looping. When you face a tough problem, your brain might try to avoid doing hard work by just going over what you already know instead of digging deeper. For example, when I work on a math proof, I tend to keep repeating the easy parts instead of tackling the harder parts that lead to the solution. You need to be aware of looping because it can ruin your whole meditation session. If you catch yourself looping, just acknowledge it and shift your focus to the next step.\n\n**Tip #2: Organize Your Deep Thinking**  \n“Thinking deeply” about a problem sounds simple, but it can actually be tricky. When you finally have a quiet mind, a tough problem, and time to think, figuring out what to do next can be surprisingly hard. From my experience, it helps to have a plan for deep thinking. Start by reviewing the important details you need to solve the problem and keep those in your mind. For example, if you’re outlining a chapter for a book, the key points you want to cover are your important details. If you’re solving a math proof, those details might be the main concepts you need to consider.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how to improve your focus and deep thinking skills, especially when facing tough problems. It offers two main tips: avoid distractions and looping, and organize your thoughts for better clarity. Patience and structure are key to making progress.",
