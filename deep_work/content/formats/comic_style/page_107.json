  "simplified_text": "Rule #3  \nQuit Social Media  \n\nIn 2013, a guy named Baratunde Thurston, who writes about digital stuff, decided to try something different. He took a break from all social media for twenty-five days. That meant no Facebook, no Twitter, no Foursquare (a site where he was super popular), and not even checking his email. He felt like he really needed this break. Thurston, who his friends called “the most connected man in the world,” had been super busy online, having over fifty-nine thousand Gmail chats and posting fifteen hundred times on Facebook just the year before. He said, “I was burnt out. Fried. Done. Toast.”\n\nWe know about his experiment because he wrote about it in a magazine called Fast Company, with the funny title “#UnPlug.” In the article, he shared that it didn’t take long for him to get used to not being online. By the end of the first week, he felt more relaxed and wasn’t stressed about missing out on news. He realized he still mattered even without posting everything online. He started talking to strangers, enjoyed meals without taking photos for Instagram, and even bought a bike. He found it easier to ride without checking Twitter all the time. He said, “The end came too soon,” but he had work to do, so after twenty-five days, he went back online.\n\nBaratunde Thurston’s experiment shows two big things about how we use social media like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, as well as sites like Business Insider and BuzzFeed. First, we’re starting to understand that these platforms can break our focus and make it hard to concentrate. This isn’t up for debate anymore; we all feel it. This is a real issue for many people, especially if you want to get better at focusing on your work. In the last rule, I shared some tips to help you concentrate better, but it will be way harder if you keep getting distracted by social media.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Baratunde Thurston took a 25-day break from social media to reduce stress and improve focus. He found it easier to enjoy life without online distractions. His experience highlights how social media can break our concentration and make it tough to work deeply.",
