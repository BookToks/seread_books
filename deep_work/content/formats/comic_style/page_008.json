  "simplified_text": "I don’t really have a strong opinion on this big debate about work culture. What I care about is how this change is actually creating a huge chance for people who see the value in focusing on deeper work instead of just the surface stuff. A good example of this is a guy named Jason Benn, who was just a bored consultant from Virginia.\n\nIt’s easy to feel unimportant in today’s job market. For Jason, it hit him hard when he figured out that most of his job as a financial consultant could be done by a simple Excel script. The company he worked for made reports for banks that were involved in complicated deals. He joked that the work was as boring as it sounds. Creating these reports took hours of messing around with data in Excel spreadsheets. When he started, it took him up to six hours to finish one report, while the faster workers could do it in about three hours. This frustrated him a lot.\n\nBenn thought the whole process was slow and outdated. He knew about a feature in Excel called macros that could help automate tasks. After reading some articles, he created a new worksheet with these macros that turned the six-hour job into something he could do with just a button click. What used to take him a whole day now took less than an hour.\n\nJason is pretty smart. He graduated from a top college, the University of Virginia, with an economics degree, and like many people, he had big dreams for his career. But he quickly realized that if his main skills could be done by an Excel macro, he wouldn’t get far. So, he decided he needed to make himself more valuable. After doing some research, he told his family he would quit his job and become a computer programmer. There was just one problem: Jason didn’t know how to code at all.\n\nAs someone who knows about programming, I can tell you it’s not easy. Most new programmers spend four years in college learning before they get their first job, and even then, it’s super competitive. Jason didn’t have that kind of time. After his realization with Excel, he quit his job and moved back home to get ready for his next move. His parents were happy he was taking charge of his future.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Jason Benn realized his job as a financial consultant was boring and could be automated. He created a way to speed up his work using Excel macros, but then decided to quit and become a programmer, even though he didn't know how to code. He moved back home to prepare for this new path.",
