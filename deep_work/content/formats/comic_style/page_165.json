This book was first published in 1986 but got a new edition in 2012 because Isaacson has been doing really well with his other books. \n\nPeople say that Isaacson's book gives a detailed look at its subjects and compares them to famous historical figures. \n\nRobert Caro has some interesting habits that help him work better. Jonathan Darman wrote about Caro's routines in Newsweek in 2009, and you can find more about him on Mason Currey’s Daily Routines blog. \n\nMason Currey also shared some info about Charles Darwin's daily life, which comes from a book by R.B. Freeman. \n\nThere’s a common belief that artists don’t wait for inspiration, and Mason Currey discussed this in a Slate.com article. \n\nDavid Brooks wrote in the New York Times that creative thinkers often have routines like artists do. \n\nFriedrich Nietzsche once said that the best ideas come from walking, and this idea is explored in a book about walking and philosophy by Frédérick Gros. \n\nJ.K. Rowling shared a story about finishing \"Deathly Hallows\" during an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2010. \n\nThere’s also a story about how fans pay a lot of money to stay in the hotel room where she finished writing the Harry Potter series. \n\nBill Gates has a special time called \"Think Weeks\" where he reflects on Microsoft’s future, and you can read about it in the Wall Street Journal. \n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses productivity secrets from various famous figures like Jerry Seinfeld, J.K.
