This usually happens during important events. But this time, something was different. Over 70 percent of the traffic was going to one specific blog. It wasn’t a big news story or an article by a famous writer; it was a blog by Nate Silver, a guy who loves baseball stats and predicts election results. Less than a year later, ESPN and ABC News offered Silver a big deal to join them, even though the Times tried to keep him by offering him a team of writers. People argue about how accurate his predictions are, but it’s clear that in 2012, this 35-year-old data expert was a big success.\n\nAnother success story is David Heinemeier Hansson, a computer programming genius who created Ruby on Rails, a tool that helps build popular websites like Twitter and Hulu. He’s also a partner at Basecamp, a well-known development company. Hansson doesn’t share how much money he makes, but it’s likely a lot since he lives in places like Chicago, Malibu, and Marbella, Spain, where he enjoys racing cars.\n\nThe last example of someone doing really well is John Doerr, a partner at a famous venture capital firm in Silicon Valley called Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. He helped fund many important companies that are part of today’s tech boom, like Twitter, Google, and Amazon. His investments have paid off big time, and he’s worth over $3 billion right now.\n\nSo, why have Silver, Hansson, and Doerr been so successful? There are two main reasons.  \n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** This passage highlights three successful individuals: Nate Silver, David Heinemeier Hansson, and John Doerr, showcasing their achievements in data analysis, programming, and venture capital. Their successes stem from their unique skills and the opportunities they seized in their respective fields.",
