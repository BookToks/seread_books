  "simplified_text": "Gonzalez talks about computer programming like woodworkers talk about their craft. In a popular book called *The Pragmatic Programmer*, it connects coding to old-school craftsmanship by quoting a saying from medieval stone workers: “We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals.” The book explains that programmers should think of their work the same way.\n\nIn any project, there’s always space for personal style and skill. A hundred years from now, our engineering might look outdated, just like the methods of medieval builders seem old to today’s engineers. But the skill we put into our work will still be respected.\n\nYou don’t have to be working in a fancy place for your work to be considered craftsmanship. Many skilled jobs in today’s information economy can show craftsmanship. Whether you’re a writer, marketer, consultant, or lawyer, your work is a craft. If you improve your skills and do your job with care, you can create meaning in your everyday work life, just like a skilled wheelwright.\n\nSome people might think their job is too boring to have meaning. But that’s not true, and thinking about traditional craftsmanship can help change that mindset. In our culture, we focus a lot on job titles. We often hear advice to “follow your passion,” which suggests that the specific job you choose is what matters most for job satisfaction. This leads to the idea that only certain jobs, like working for a nonprofit or starting a tech company, can be fulfilling, while all other jobs are dull.\n\nThe ideas from Dreyfus and Kelly help us break free from this way of thinking. The craftsmen they mention didn’t have fancy jobs. For most of history, being a blacksmith or wheelwright wasn’t glamorous. But that doesn’t matter because the meaning comes from the skill and care in the craftsmanship, not the job itself. In other words, a wooden wheel might not seem special, but the process of making it can be. The same goes for knowledge work. You don’t need a fancy job; you just need to approach your work with skill and passion.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Gonzalez compares computer programming to traditional craftsmanship, emphasizing that any job can hold meaning if done with skill and care. He argues against the belief that only certain jobs are fulfilling, highlighting that the approach to work matters more than the job title.",
