If you don’t, you’ll never have time for the big, important things.” It can be comforting to know that, according to professors at MIT, people quickly adjust to how you communicate. If you don’t reply to their quick messages, it probably isn’t a big deal in their lives.\n\nOnce you get over feeling weird about this, you’ll start to see the benefits. There are two common ideas about dealing with too many emails. One is that sending emails leads to even more emails, and the other is that dealing with confusing or pointless emails causes a lot of stress. The method suggested here tackles both problems. You send fewer emails and ignore the ones that are hard to deal with, which will help you take back control of your time and focus.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** It's okay to let small issues slide and not respond to every email. This approach helps reduce email stress and gives you more time for important things in life.",
