A survey by the National Sleep Foundation showed that Americans think they sleep about seven hours a night. But when people actually measured their sleep, it turned out they were getting around 8.6 hours. Another study found that people who said they worked sixty to sixty-four hours a week were really only working about forty-four hours. Those claiming to work more than seventy-five hours were actually working less than fifty-five hours.\n\nThese examples highlight an important point: we often go through our day without really thinking about how we use our time. This can be a problem. It’s hard to stop wasting time if you don’t take a good look at how much deep work versus shallow work you’re doing. You should get into the habit of pausing and asking yourself, “What makes the most sense right now?” The strategy I’ll explain next is meant to help you develop these habits. It might sound a bit extreme at first, but it will be super helpful for making the most of your deep work: \n\nSchedule every minute of your day.\n\nHere’s what you should do: At the start of each workday, grab a new page in a notebook just for this. On the left side of the page, write down each hour of the day you usually work. Now, divide your work hours into blocks and assign tasks to those blocks. For example, you could set aside nine a.m. to eleven a.m. for writing a client’s press release. Draw a box that covers those hours and write “press release” inside it. Not every block has to be for work. You can also have blocks for lunch or breaks. Keep each block at least thirty minutes long, which is one line on your page. This way, instead of making a tiny box for every little task—like replying to your boss’s email or asking Carl about a report—you can group similar tasks into bigger blocks. You might want to draw a line from a task block to the right side of the page where you can list all the small tasks you plan to do in that block.\n\nWhen you finish scheduling your day, every minute should be part of a block. You’ve basically given every minute of your workday a job. Now, as you go through your day, use this schedule to keep you on track. \n\nHowever, this is where most people start to struggle. Two things can happen.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how people often misjudge their sleep and work hours. It suggests scheduling every minute of your day to stay focused and manage time better. By organizing tasks into blocks, you can improve productivity and make the most of your workday.",
