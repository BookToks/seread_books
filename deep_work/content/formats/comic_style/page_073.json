This is an example of a cool trick called the \"grand gesture.\" It means making a big change to your usual surroundings, like spending a lot of money or effort, to help you focus on important tasks. When you do this, it makes the task feel more important, which can help you stop procrastinating and get motivated.\n\nFor instance, writing a chapter of a Harry Potter book is tough no matter where you do it. But if you’re paying over $1,000 a day to write in a fancy hotel near a castle, it’s easier to find the energy to start and keep going than if you were in a distracting home office.\n\nOther famous people also use the grand gesture. Bill Gates, when he was the CEO of Microsoft, would take \"Think Weeks.\" He would leave his regular work and family stuff behind to go to a cabin with books and papers. He wanted to think deeply about important issues for his company. During one of these weeks, he realized that the Internet would be a big deal in the industry. He could have thought deeply in his office, but the change of scenery helped him focus better.\n\nAlan Lightman, a physicist and writer, also uses grand gestures. Every summer, he goes to a tiny island in Maine to think and recharge. The island has no Internet or phone service, which helps him find some peace and quiet. He said, “It’s really about two and a half months that I’ll feel like I can recover some silence in my life… which is so hard to find.”\n\nNot everyone can spend two months in Maine, but many writers, like Dan Pink and Michael Pollan, create special writing spaces on their properties. Pollan even wrote a book about building his cabin in the woods behind his old home. These spaces aren’t strictly necessary since all they really need is a laptop and a flat surface to work on.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how famous people like Rowling and Gates use big changes in their environment to help them focus on important work. This strategy, called the \"grand gesture,\" boosts motivation and reduces distractions. Writers often create special spaces to enhance their creativity and concentration.",
