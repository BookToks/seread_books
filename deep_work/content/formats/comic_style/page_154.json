  "text": "As this year went on, I became really focused on my work, and the results surprised me. In the same year that I wrote a book and my oldest son hit the terrible twos, I managed to more than double my academic output. I published nine peer-reviewed papers while still sticking to my rule of not working in the evenings.\n\nI’ll admit that my year of intense focus was maybe a bit too much. It was mentally tiring, and I’ll probably tone it down in the future. But this experience shows that deep work is way more powerful than most people think. It’s this commitment to focusing that helped Bill Gates take advantage of a big opportunity and create a new industry. It also helped me double my academic productivity while writing a book. I believe that choosing to focus instead of getting distracted can really change your life.\n\nLiving a deep life isn’t for everyone, though. It takes a lot of hard work and big changes to your habits. Many people find comfort in being busy with emails and social media, but living deeply means letting go of a lot of that. It can be scary to try to create your best work because you might realize it’s not as good as you hoped. It feels safer to just talk about culture instead of trying to change it for the better. But if you’re ready to face those fears and really focus your mind on creating things that matter, you’ll find, like many others, that deep work leads to a life full of productivity and meaning. I quoted writer Winifred Gallagher earlier, who said, “I’ll live the focused life, because it’s the best kind there is.” I agree with her, and so does Bill Gates. Hopefully, now that you’ve read this book, you feel the same way too.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** This passage discusses the power of deep work and how it can lead to greater productivity and a more meaningful life. It emphasizes the challenges of focusing deeply and the need to overcome distractions, while also highlighting the rewards of commitment to this approach."
