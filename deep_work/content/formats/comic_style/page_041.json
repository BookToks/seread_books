People like Alissa Rubin help give the Times its good reputation, and that reputation is what keeps the paper successful, especially now when everyone is hooked on click-bait. So, why does Alissa have to stop her important work to create simple content for a different media company in Silicon Valley? And why does this seem normal to so many people? If we can figure this out, we’ll understand why deep work is becoming so rare.\n\nA clue to our answer comes from Neil Postman, a communication expert and professor at NYU who passed away. In the early 1990s, when personal computers were becoming popular, Postman warned that our society was getting too close to technology. He noticed that we stopped talking about the pros and cons of new tech, just assuming that if it’s high-tech, it must be good. \n\nHe called this kind of culture a technopoly and warned against it. He said, “Technopoly makes other options invisible and irrelevant,” meaning we don’t even think about them anymore. Postman died in 2003, but if he were here today, he would probably be shocked at how quickly his worries came true, especially with the rise of the Internet. Luckily, there’s someone today who continues this discussion: Evgeny Morozov, a social critic. In his 2013 book, To Save Everything, Click Here, Morozov tries to show how obsessed we are with “the Internet,” which he puts in quotes to highlight that it’s become more of an idea than just a tool.\n\nMorozov argues that we now see “the Internet” as the key to the future of business and government. Making your company more like “the Internet” means you’re modern, while ignoring these trends makes you seem outdated. We’ve stopped seeing Internet tools as products made by companies trying to earn money.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how deep work is becoming rare as people like Alissa Rubin are pressured to create simple content for other companies. It explores Neil Postman's warning about our obsession with technology and how it has changed our views on the Internet, making it seem like the ultimate solution for business and government.",
