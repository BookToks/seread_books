  "simplified_text": "Isaacson was very organized. Whenever he had some free time, he would focus hard and work on his book. This is how he managed to write a huge nine-hundred-page book while also being one of the best magazine writers in the country.\n\nI call this way of working the \"journalist philosophy.\" This name comes from the fact that journalists, like Walter Isaacson, are trained to switch into writing mode quickly because they have tight deadlines.\n\nBut this method isn’t easy for beginners. As I mentioned before, being able to switch from easy tasks to hard ones doesn’t come naturally. Without practice, it can really drain your energy. You also need to believe in yourself—knowing that what you’re doing is important and that you can succeed. This belief usually comes from past achievements. For example, Isaacson probably found it easier to switch to writing mode than a new novelist because he had already built a reputation as a good writer. He knew he could write a great biography and that it was important for his career. This confidence helps you work harder.\n\nI really like the journalist philosophy of deep work because it’s how I fit my work into my schedule. I’m not super strict about it, and I sometimes wish I could disconnect like my friend Donald Knuth does. I don’t spend days in deep work like some people do, and I can’t always stick to a daily routine because of my busy schedule. Instead, like Isaacson, I take each week as it comes and try to get in as much deep work as I can. For example, to write this book, I had to use any free time I found. If my kids were napping, I’d grab my laptop and work in my office. If my wife wanted to visit her parents, I’d use that time to write in a quiet spot at their house. If a work meeting got canceled, I’d go to a library to write more. \n\nI have to admit that I don’t always follow the journalist philosophy perfectly. I don’t make all my deep work plans on the spot. Instead, I usually plan when I’ll do deep work for the week at the start of each week.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses the \"journalist philosophy,\" where writers like Isaacson fit deep work into their busy schedules. It highlights the importance of confidence and practice in switching between easy and hard tasks, and how the author applies this method to their own work routine.",
