  "simplified_text": "It's really important to spend time with the people who matter to you, like having a long chat, sharing a meal, or doing something fun together. You should also be willing to help them out, even if it means making some sacrifices to make their lives better.\n\nNot everyone will have the same goals or activities, but a lot of people can relate to this idea. Now, let’s look at Facebook and how it fits into this personal goal. Facebook has a lot of perks for your social life. For example, it helps you catch up with friends you haven’t seen in a while, keep in touch with people you don’t see often, find out about important events in their lives, and discover online groups that match your interests.\n\nThese are all good things that Facebook offers, but they don’t really help with the two main activities we talked about, which are more about real-life effort. So, the conclusion might be surprising: Facebook has its benefits, but they’re not important enough to take up your time and attention.\n\nJust to be clear, I’m not saying everyone should stop using Facebook. I’m just saying that for this specific example, it might be better to stop using it. However, there are other situations where using Facebook could be helpful. For instance, a college freshman might want to make new friends, so going to events and meeting different people would be important. In this case, Facebook could really help with that.\n\nAnother example is a soldier deployed overseas. For them, staying in touch with friends and family back home might be a top priority, and social networks could help with that too. \n\nWhat’s clear from these examples is that this strategy can help many people decide whether or not to use social media like Facebook or Twitter.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses the importance of spending time with loved ones and making sacrifices for them. It examines how Facebook can help or hinder social goals, depending on individual circumstances, like making new friends in college or staying connected while in the military.",
