  "simplified_text": "A lot of young adults today are just figuring things out as they go. We quickly look up to all these digital gadgets as proof that we’re moving forward into a new and exciting world. \n\nThis focus on the Internet is what today’s technopoly looks like. It’s important to see this because it helps explain the question we started with. The New York Times has a social media team and pushes its writers, like Alissa Rubin, to act in ways that grab attention. In a world that’s all about the Internet, this behavior isn’t really up for debate. If you don’t jump on the Internet bandwagon, as Postman would say, you become “invisible” and don’t matter.\n\nThis invisibility explains the outrage when Jonathan Franzen suggested that writers shouldn’t use Twitter. People got upset not because they knew a lot about book marketing and disagreed with him, but because it shocked them that someone serious would say social media isn’t important. In a tech-focused world, saying something like that is like burning a flag—it's seen as a huge insult, not a discussion.\n\nI had a moment that really showed me how widespread this mindset is. While I was waiting to cross the street on my way to work at Georgetown, I stood behind a truck from a company that handles refrigerated shipping. This business is super complicated and old-school, totally different from the trendy tech startups we hear about all the time. But what caught my attention was a big sign on the back of the truck that said, “like us on Facebook.” \n\nDeep work, which focuses on quality and skill, struggles in a technopoly because it’s seen as old-fashioned and not techy. Even worse, doing deep work often means ignoring a lot of new tech stuff. Deep work gets pushed aside for more distracting activities, like using social media professionally, not because it’s worse. If we had solid data on how these behaviors affect success, our current tech-driven culture might fall apart. But since we lack clear metrics, we end up treating everything Internet-related as the ultimate truth.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how young adults often idolize technology and social media, leading to a culture where traditional skills and deep work are overlooked. It highlights the tension between old-fashioned values and the current tech-driven mindset, emphasizing the challenges faced by those who prioritize quality and craftsmanship.",
