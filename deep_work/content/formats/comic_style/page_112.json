  "text": "I can make money by selling animals because they also produce manure, which helps my soil. When I buy hay, I’m not just spending money; I’m getting animal protein and manure, which gives my land more nutrients. Plus, I don’t have to drive heavy machines over my fields all summer, which can hurt the soil.\n\nWhen Pritchard decided on the baler, he looked beyond just the money. He thought about how it would affect the long-term health of his fields. He figured that buying hay would keep his fields healthier. He said, “Soil fertility is my baseline.” So, he decided he didn’t need the baler.\n\nPritchard’s decision was complicated. It shows that just finding one good thing about a tool isn’t enough for people in his line of work. Sure, a hay baler has its benefits—every tool does. But it also has downsides. Pritchard knew this decision wouldn’t be simple. He started with what mattered most to him: healthy soil. Then he made his final choice about the tool.\n\nIf you work with information and want to focus deeply on your tasks, you should choose your tools carefully, just like farmers do. I call this the craftsman approach to tool selection. It means that tools should help you reach your main goals.\n\nThe Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection means you should figure out what really matters for your success and happiness. Only pick a tool if its benefits are way better than its downsides.\n\nThis craftsman approach is different from the any-benefit approach. The any-benefit mindset says that any good thing about a tool is enough to use it. But the craftsman approach wants those good things to really matter to you and be better than the bad things.\n\nEven though the craftsman approach doesn’t ignore the benefits that attract people to certain tools, it doesn’t make blanket statements about what technology is good or bad. It just focuses on what really helps you.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how Pritchard carefully chooses tools, focusing on their long-term impact on soil health. It introduces the craftsman approach to tool selection, emphasizing that tools should significantly benefit your main goals while outweighing their downsides."
