The industrial revolution had created a new group of workers called white-collar workers. These people could now work in offices for a set number of hours each week and earn a steady paycheck to support their families. This way of living might seem normal to us now, but for Bennett and others back then, it was new and kind of stressful. He was worried that these workers were missing out on living their best lives.\n\nBennett talks about a typical office worker in London who works from ten in the morning to six in the evening and spends almost an hour commuting to and from work. This person only has about sixteen hours left in the day after work. Bennett thinks that’s a lot of time, but many people don’t see how valuable it really is. He believes that the big mistake this worker makes is thinking that the hours spent at work are the only important part of the day. He sees work as something to just get through, and he considers the time before and after work as less important. Bennett says this way of thinking is completely wrong and unhealthy.\n\nSo, what should this worker do instead? Bennett suggests that he should think of those sixteen free hours as a “day within a day.” During this time, he is free and doesn’t have to worry about money or work. Bennett believes he should use this time to improve himself, just like someone who is wealthy would. He thinks this means reading great books and poetry.\n\nEven though Bennett wrote about these ideas over a hundred years ago, you might think our views on free time would have changed since then. But they really haven’t.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Arnold Bennett, an early 1900s writer, warned that office workers often waste their free time after work. He encouraged people to see their free hours as valuable opportunities for self-improvement, like reading great literature, rather than just focusing on work. Despite changes over the years, many still struggle with this mindset.",
