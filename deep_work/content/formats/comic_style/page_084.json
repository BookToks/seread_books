  "simplified_text": "When I was getting close to deadlines for my papers, the 4DX habit helped me stay focused all year. I have to say, it was a tiring year, especially since I was also writing this book. But it really showed me how effective the 4DX method is: by the summer of 2014, I had nine papers accepted for publication, which was way more than I had ever done in a year before.\n\nIn a 2012 article for a New York Times blog, Tim Kreider, who is a writer and cartoonist, described himself as “the laziest ambitious person I know.” He didn’t like being super busy, but he found himself overwhelmed with work before writing his article. He said, “Every morning my inbox was full of emails asking me to do things I didn’t want to do or giving me problems I had to solve.”\n\nTo escape this, he went to what he called an “undisclosed location,” a place without TV or Internet. The only way to go online was to bike to the library. This helped him avoid all the little tasks that seemed harmless but added up and distracted him from doing serious work. Kreider said, “I remembered about buttercups, stink bugs, and the stars. I read. And I’m finally getting some real writing done for the first time in months.”\n\nIt’s important to know that Kreider isn’t trying to make a big social statement by stepping away from busyness. He did it because he realized it actually helped him do his job better. He explained that being idle isn’t just a break or a bad habit; it’s really important for our brains, just like vitamin D is for our bodies. Without it, we can feel mentally unwell. He believes that to do meaningful work, we need time to relax our minds.\n\nWhen Kreider talks about getting work done, he’s not talking about easy tasks. The more time you spend on simple work, the more you can get done. But as a writer and artist, he focuses on deep work—the serious stuff that really matters. He thinks that to do this kind of work, you need to give your mind time to rest.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how staying focused with the 4DX method helped the author publish more papers. It also highlights Tim Kreider's belief that taking breaks is essential for doing meaningful work, as it helps clear the mind and boosts creativity.",
