  "simplified_text": "Seeing real results was important. It also helped me understand how many hours of focused work I needed for each result. This realization, which was more than I initially thought, motivated me to fit more focused hours into my week.\n\n**Discipline #4: Create a Cadence of Accountability**  \nThe authors of 4DX explain that the last step to keep an eye on important goals is to have regular meetings with any team working on a big goal. In these meetings, team members need to check their progress, agree on specific actions to improve their results before the next meeting, and talk about what happened with their previous commitments. They say these reviews can be quick, but they need to happen often to be effective. The authors believe this is where real action takes place.\n\nIf you’re working on your own deep work habits, you might not have a team to meet with, but you still need to hold yourself accountable. Throughout this book, I suggest doing a weekly review where you plan for the upcoming week (see Rule #4). During my 4DX experiments, I used a weekly review to check my progress, celebrate good weeks, understand what caused bad weeks, and figure out how to keep improving. This helped me change my schedule to focus more on my important tasks, allowing for way more deep work than if I hadn’t done those reviews.\n\nThe 4DX framework is built on the idea that actually getting things done is harder than just planning. After studying many cases, the creators found a few key habits that really help with this challenge. So, it makes sense that these habits can also help you build your own deep work routine.\n\nTo wrap it up, let’s go back to my example. When I first started using 4DX, I aimed to publish five research papers in the 2013–2014 school year. This was a big goal since I had only published four papers the year before, which I was proud of. During this 4DX trial, having a clear goal and the feedback from my progress scoreboard pushed me to work deeper than I ever had before. Looking back, it wasn’t just the intensity of my focused work that increased, but how regularly I did it. I used to do my deep work in bursts, but now I was more consistent.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses the importance of accountability and regular reviews in achieving goals. It emphasizes that consistent deep work habits lead to better results, using the author's experience with a research goal as an example.",
