  "simplified_text": "In a column from the New York Times, David Brooks talks about how smart people think like artists but work like accountants. This means that to really get into your deep work sessions, you should create strict routines, just like the great thinkers he mentions. There’s a good reason for this: famous people like Caro and Darwin didn’t have these routines just to be different; they needed them to succeed. Their routines helped them focus deeply and stay in that focused state longer. If they had waited for inspiration to hit before working hard, they probably wouldn’t have achieved as much.\n\nThere isn’t one perfect deep work routine; it really depends on the person and the project. But there are some important questions every good routine should answer:\n\n• Where will you work and for how long? Your routine should include a specific place for your deep work. This could be as simple as your usual office with the door closed and your desk cleared off. One of my colleagues even puts a “do not disturb” sign on his door when he’s working on something tough. If you can find a spot that’s only for deep work, like a quiet library, that can help even more. If you work in an open office, finding a place to focus becomes really important. Also, make sure to set a time limit for your work session so it feels like a challenge, not just a long, boring task.\n\n• How will you work once you start? Your routine should have rules to keep you on track. For example, you might decide not to use the Internet or set a goal for how many words you want to write every twenty minutes. Without these rules, you’ll waste time thinking about what you should or shouldn’t be doing, which can drain your energy.\n\n• How will you support your work? Your routine should help your brain stay sharp. For instance, you might start with a cup of good coffee or make sure you have snacks nearby.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** David Brooks emphasizes that successful people create strict routines for deep work to maximize focus and productivity. Each routine should define where and how long to work, establish rules for staying on task, and ensure proper support for the brain.",
