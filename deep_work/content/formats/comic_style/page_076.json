To explain this, let’s look at where this idea of breakthroughs comes from.\n\nThere are many sources for this theory, but I have a personal story about one of the most famous ones. During my seven years at MIT, I worked in a place called Building 20. This building was located at the corner of Main and Vassar Streets in East Cambridge and was torn down in 1998. It was originally built quickly during World War II to hold extra people from the busy Radiation Laboratory. A 2012 article in the New Yorker said that the building was seen as a failure at first because it had poor ventilation, dark hallways, thin walls, a leaky roof, and was too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter.\n\nAfter the war, more scientists kept coming to Cambridge. MIT needed more space, so instead of tearing down Building 20 as they had promised, they kept using it. This meant that different departments, like nuclear science, linguistics, and electronics, all shared the same building. There were also some unusual tenants like a machine shop and a piano repair shop. Because the building was cheap, these groups felt free to change things around. They could move walls and floors and attach equipment to the beams. For example, when Jerrold Zacharias was working on the first atomic clock, he was able to remove two floors from his lab in Building 20 to fit in the big cylinder he needed for his experiment.\n\nAt MIT, people believe that mixing different fields in a flexible building led to random meetings and a creative vibe that helped people make breakthroughs quickly. They worked on a wide range of topics, from Chomsky grammars to Loran navigational radars and even video games, all during the same busy years after the war. When Building 20 was finally taken down to build the new Stata Center, which cost $300 million and was designed by Frank Gehry, many people were sad. To honor the “plywood palace” that was lost, the Stata Center’s design includes unfinished plywood boards and exposed concrete with construction marks still visible.\n\nAround the same time that Building 20 was built, there was also a more organized effort to encourage unexpected creativity happening in Murray Hill, New Jersey, about 200 miles away. Here, Mervin Kelly, the director of Bell Labs, was leading this effort.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how Building 20 at MIT, built during WWII, became a hub for creativity by mixing different fields. Despite its poor conditions, it fostered innovation. When it was demolished for the Stata Center, its legacy was honored in the new design. Meanwhile, similar efforts to promote creativity were happening at Bell Labs in New Jersey.",
