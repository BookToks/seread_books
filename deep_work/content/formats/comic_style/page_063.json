  "simplified_text": "All of my time and attention are already taken up, so please don’t ask for them.\n\nTo explain why he’s hard to reach, Stephenson wrote an essay called “Why I Am a Bad Correspondent.” He says that being productive isn’t a simple thing. This is why he doesn’t respond to many emails or accept speaking invitations. If he can set up his life to have long, uninterrupted time to write, he can create good novels. But if that time gets broken up, he can’t write as well or as fast.\n\nStephenson believes he has two choices: he can write good novels regularly, or he can spend time answering emails and going to events, which would slow down his writing and lower its quality. He chose to focus on writing, which means he tries to avoid distractions in his work life. This idea is so important to him that he even wrote about it in his 2008 sci-fi book, Anathem, where smart people live away from distractions to think deeply.\n\nFrom my experience, this way of thinking can make some people defensive. Those who follow this philosophy clearly see their value, which might bother others whose work is more complicated. For example, a high-level manager is crucial to a big company, even if she can’t show a finished project like a book. So, not everyone needs to follow this simple philosophy, and that’s fine. If you’re not in this group, don’t feel jealous. But if you are in this group, where your work is clear and individual, you should really think about this philosophy. It could make a big difference in your career.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses Stephenson's choice to focus on writing rather than responding to emails or attending events. He believes that uninterrupted time is crucial for producing quality work. This philosophy may not apply to everyone, but it can greatly benefit those whose contributions are clear and individual.",
