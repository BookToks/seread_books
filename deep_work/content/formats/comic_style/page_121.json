  "simplified_text": "Social media gives us personalized info at random times, which makes it super addictive. This can really mess up your focus and plans. You’d think people who need to concentrate, like programmers or writers, would stay away from these tools. But social media companies have done a great job convincing everyone that if you don’t use their products, you’ll miss out on something important.\n\nThis fear of missing out is similar to a guy named Nicodemus who was afraid to throw away stuff he might need later. I suggest trying something like his packing party. If you take a break from social media for a month, you can see that missing out on events or conversations isn’t as big of a deal as it seems. After this break, most people realize that social media isn’t really that important in their lives.\n\nI recommend not telling anyone about your month off from social media. Some people think others care about what they say online, and they worry about disappointing them if they stop posting. I’m joking a bit, but this feeling is real and needs to be addressed. For example, the average Twitter user has 208 followers. When you see that many people want to hear from you, it’s easy to think your posts matter a lot. Trust me, I know how addictive that feeling can be!\n\nBut here’s the truth about social media audiences. Before these platforms, building an audience took a lot of hard work. Back in the early 2000s, anyone could start a blog, but getting even a few visitors meant you had to share valuable content. I remember starting my first blog in 2003 called \"Inspiring Moniker.\" I’m a bit embarrassed to say that for a long time, no one read it. Over the next ten years, I learned how to slowly build an audience.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Social media is addictive and can distract you from focusing on important tasks. Taking a month off can help you realize it’s not as crucial as it seems. Many think others care about their posts, but building an audience used to take real effort.",
