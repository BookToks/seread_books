  "text": "In the summer after his first year of college, Roosevelt went to the Adirondacks. His work was well-liked in a serious birdwatching magazine, which made people think he was “one of the most knowledgeable young naturalists in the United States” at such a young age.\n\nTo keep up with his birdwatching and other activities, Roosevelt had to cut down on his study time at Harvard. A guy named Morris looked at Roosevelt’s diary and letters from that time and figured out that he was only studying about a quarter of the day. You might think this would make his grades drop, but they didn’t. He wasn’t the best student, but he did well, getting honor grades in five out of seven classes during his freshman year.\n\nThe reason for this surprising success was how Roosevelt handled his schoolwork. He planned his day from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and took out the time for classes, sports practice, and lunch. The leftover time was what he used for studying. Even though it wasn’t a lot of time, he made the most of it by focusing only on schoolwork during those periods and working really hard. Morris said that even though Roosevelt spent less time at his desk, his focus was so strong that he could take more breaks than most students.\n\nThis strategy suggests that you should try to work with the same intensity as Roosevelt. First, find a big task that’s important to you. Figure out how much time you usually need for it, then set a tight deadline that gives you less time. If you can, tell someone else about your deadline to keep yourself accountable. If that’s not possible, use a countdown timer on your phone and keep it where you can see it while you work.\n\nTo finish your task on time, you need to work really hard—no checking emails, daydreaming, or scrolling through social media. Like Roosevelt, focus all your energy on the task until you get it done.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Roosevelt balanced his love for nature with his studies at Harvard, managing to do well in school despite limited study time. His intense focus and strategic planning helped him succeed, offering a lesson in productivity for anyone tackling important tasks."
