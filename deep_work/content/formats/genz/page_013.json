  "text": "In the evenings, I spend time with my wife and two sons, and I manage to read a lot of books, even though I’m a busy dad. I’ve noticed that not having many distractions helps calm my mind, which is something a lot of people struggle with these days. I’m okay with being bored, and that can actually be a cool skill—especially on a lazy summer night in D.C. when I’m listening to a Nationals game on the radio.\n\nThis book is about why I prefer deep thinking over shallow stuff, and I want to share some strategies that have helped me focus on what really matters. I’ve written this down to help you learn how to build your life around deep work, but that’s not the only reason. I also want to clarify my own thoughts and improve my own skills. I believe that understanding deep work has helped me succeed, but I still think I can do even better. As you work through the ideas in the chapters, know that I’m also trying to cut out the shallow stuff and focus on what’s important. You’ll see how I do in the conclusion of this book.\n\nWhen Carl Jung wanted to change psychiatry, he built a retreat in the woods. His Bollingen Tower was a place where he could think deeply and create amazing work that changed the world. In the upcoming pages, I’ll encourage you to create your own personal Bollingen Tower. This means learning to produce real value in a world full of distractions and understanding a truth that many successful people from the past believed: A deep life is a fulfilling life.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The author shares his journey of valuing deep thinking over distractions while spending time with family. He aims to help readers build their own focus and productivity, inspired by Carl Jung's retreat, promoting the idea that a deep life leads to true fulfillment."
