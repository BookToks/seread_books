Instead, you’ll learn to choose your tools more wisely, focusing on what really matters to you. This is important because figuring out what’s best for your life isn’t always easy. It takes practice and trying different things. The strategies will help you look at your network tools from different perspectives. Together, they can help you build a better relationship with your tools, giving you more control over your time and attention so you can succeed with the ideas in Part 2.\n\nOne example is Malcolm Gladwell, who doesn’t use Twitter. In a 2013 interview, he said, “Who says my fans want to hear from me on Twitter?” He joked that some people might want to see less of him. Another famous author, Michael Lewis, also doesn’t use Twitter. He said, “I don’t tweet, I don’t Twitter, I couldn’t even tell you how to read or where to find a Twitter message.” George Packer, an award-winning writer, also avoids Twitter and only recently got a smartphone.\n\nThese writers don’t think Twitter is useless; they know some people find it helpful. Packer mentioned he doesn’t use Twitter in response to a positive article about it by David Carr, a media critic. Carr said that Twitter helps him keep up with news and reactions quickly, instead of spending a lot of time searching for information. However, Gladwell, Lewis, and Packer don’t see enough benefits to make using Twitter worth it for them.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how to thoughtfully choose network tools instead of just using any that seem beneficial. It highlights the experiences of authors like Malcolm Gladwell and Michael Lewis, who avoid Twitter, recognizing its usefulness for others but not for themselves.",
