Now, he studies with a famous philosopher.\n\nOne reason for this change comes from research by Henry Roediger, who leads the Memory Lab at the University of Washington in Saint Louis. In 2014, Roediger and his team went to the Extreme Memory Tournament in San Diego. They wanted to find out what makes these amazing memorizers different from everyone else. Roediger explained in a New York Times blog that one big difference is not just about memory but about attention. This ability, called “attentional control,” measures how well someone can focus on important information.\n\nSo, when you train your memory, you also get better at concentrating. This skill can help you with any task that needs deep focus. Daniel Kilov didn’t become a top student just because of his great memory; it was his effort to improve his memory that gave him the focus he needed to succeed in school.\n\nThe strategy here is to copy a part of Kilov’s training to boost your concentration. Specifically, it asks you to learn how to memorize a shuffled deck of cards, which is a cool skill that many memory athletes have. The technique I’ll share comes from Ron White, a former USA Memory Champion and world record holder in card memorization.\n\nWhite points out that professional memory athletes never just try to memorize by repeating things over and over. This method, popular among tired students, doesn’t really fit how our brains work. We aren’t built to quickly remember abstract facts. Instead, we’re great at remembering scenes. Think of a recent event you enjoyed, like going to a conference or meeting a friend for a drink. Try to picture it clearly. Most people can remember these moments vividly, even if they didn’t try hard to remember them at the time. If you counted the unique details in that memory, you’d be surprised by how many you could recall.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how improving memory can enhance focus and concentration. It highlights research on memory athletes and introduces techniques for memorizing, like using vivid scenes instead of rote memorization.",
