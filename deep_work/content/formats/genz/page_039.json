Unlike people who can show their work, like fixing cars or building things, knowledge workers don’t have clear signs of their success. To deal with this confusion, many are looking back to the past, especially the time when factories were the norm.\n\nBack in the day, when assembly lines were popular, a guy named Frederic Taylor focused on making workers faster. He would time how long it took them to do tasks. In his time, it was easy to measure productivity by counting how many items were made in a certain time. Nowadays, many knowledge workers feel lost and are trying to measure their productivity in the same old way, even if it doesn’t really fit their jobs. For example, David Allen talks about “cranking widgets” to describe being productive. It seems like knowledge workers are becoming more focused on looking busy because they don’t have better ways to show their value. We can call this trend \"Busyness as Proxy for Productivity.\"\n\nSince there aren’t clear signs of being productive, many knowledge workers go back to the old idea of being busy and doing lots of visible tasks. This way of thinking helps explain why some people engage in behaviors that don’t really help them. If you’re always sending emails, attending meetings, or quickly responding to messages, it makes you look busy to others. If you think being busy means you’re doing your job well, then these actions seem really important.\n\nThis way of thinking isn’t completely unreasonable. For some jobs, being busy really does matter. For instance, in 2013, Yahoo’s CEO Marissa Mayer told employees they couldn’t work from home anymore. She looked at the company’s server logs and got upset because she saw that remote workers weren’t as active.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Many knowledge workers struggle to show their productivity and often resort to looking busy instead. This trend, called \"Busyness as Proxy for Productivity,\" leads them to engage in visible tasks to prove their worth, even if it doesn't truly reflect their effectiveness.",
