He called it \"crack for media addicts\" and said he doesn't use it because he fears he might get so distracted that he wouldn't take care of important things, like feeding his son. Interestingly, while he was writing about this, he was also working on his book, The Unwinding, which won a big award later on, even without him using social media.\n\nTo sum it up, big trends in business today make it harder for people to focus deeply on their work. Even though these trends promise benefits like faster responses and more opportunities, the real advantages come from being able to concentrate deeply. This chapter aims to explain why deep work is becoming rare. The reasons we get distracted at work are often based on confusing ideas and not as solid as we think. I want to show you that while distractions are real, they can be ignored if you choose to focus on developing a strong work ethic.\n\nIn the fall of 2012, Tom Cochran, who was in charge of technology at Atlantic Media, got worried about how much time he was spending on email. So, he decided to track it. He found that in one week, he got 511 emails and sent 284, which averaged to about 160 emails a day. Even if he only spent thirty seconds on each email, that added up to almost an hour and a half each day just dealing with messages. This seemed like a lot of time wasted on something that wasn't really part of his main job.\n\nCochran wrote a blog post for the Harvard Business Review about his findings. He started to wonder how much time everyone at Atlantic Media was spending on emails instead of doing the actual work they were hired for. He wanted to find out the answer to this question. \n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how distractions, especially from social media and emails, make it hard for people to focus on deep work. It highlights George Packer's concerns about Twitter and Tom Cochran's email tracking, showing that many spend too much time on distractions instead of their real jobs.",
