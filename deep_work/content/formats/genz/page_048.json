  "text": "We can take a step back and use Gallagher’s big idea to understand how deep work helps us live better lives. His theory says that your life is shaped by what you focus on. So, think about what happens when you spend a lot of time on deep tasks. Deep work feels important, whether you’re a blacksmith making a sword or a programmer improving a computer program. Gallagher suggests that if you spend enough time in this focused state, your mind will see your life as meaningful and significant.\n\nBut there’s another important benefit to being really focused at work. When you concentrate hard, it keeps your mind from noticing all the little annoying things that pop up in our daily lives. A psychologist named Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi talks about this advantage too. He says that when you have super intense focus, you won’t have any leftover attention to think about unimportant stuff or worry about problems. This is especially true in jobs that rely on constant internet access, which can distract you with a lot of tempting things that, if you focus on them, can take away the meaning from your life.\n\nTo show you what I mean, I’ll share my own experience. Think about the last five emails I sent before I started writing this chapter. Here are the subject lines and what they were about:\n\n• Re: URGENT calnewport Brand Registration Confirmation. This was a reply to a scam email trying to trick website owners into registering their domain in China. I was annoyed by their constant spam, so I lost my cool and told them their scam would be better if they spelled “website” right in their emails.\n\n• Re: S R. This was a chat with a family member about an article he found in the Wall Street Journal.\n\n• Re: Important Advice. This email was part of a discussion about the best retirement investment strategies.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Gallagher's theory shows that focusing on deep work can make life feel more meaningful. Intense concentration helps block out distractions and annoying thoughts. My own emails illustrate how everyday tasks can pull us away from deeper, more important work."
