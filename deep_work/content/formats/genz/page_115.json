  "simplified_text": "It's too vague to say \"doing better research,\" but saying \"finish paper on broadcast lower bounds for the upcoming conference\" is too specific since it's just a one-time thing. A better goal would be something like: \"regularly read and understand the latest results in my field.\"\n\nNext, think about the tools you use. For each tool, look at the key activities you came up with and decide if the tool helps a lot, hurts a lot, or has little effect on your success in those activities. The important choice is to keep using a tool only if it really helps and outweighs any negatives.\n\nTo show how this works, let’s look at an example. Imagine Michael Lewis has a goal for his writing career: to create well-written, story-driven pieces that change how people see the world.\n\nHis key activities to support this goal are:\n- Research patiently and deeply.\n- Write carefully and with purpose.\n\nNow, let’s say Lewis is trying to decide if he should use Twitter. He needs to check how Twitter affects the activities that help him reach his goal. It’s hard to say that Twitter would really help him with deep research or careful writing. For Lewis, deep research means spending weeks or months getting to know a few sources, and careful writing needs him to focus without distractions. So, Twitter probably doesn’t help at all and might even be harmful because it can be addictive. So, he should probably avoid Twitter.\n\nYou might think it’s unfair to only look at this one goal since Twitter can help connect writers with their audience and boost sales. But for someone like Michael Lewis, marketing might not be a big enough goal to focus on.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how to set effective goals and evaluate tools like Twitter for research and writing. It uses Michael Lewis as an example, showing that Twitter may not help him achieve his writing goals and could even distract him.",
