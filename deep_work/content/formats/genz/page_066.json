Isaac was doing open mic nights and saw this as a chance to ask Seinfeld for advice on being a better comic. Seinfeld’s advice was simple but powerful: to get better at comedy, you need to write better jokes, and to write better jokes, you have to write every day.\n\nSeinfeld shared a technique he used to keep himself disciplined. He keeps a calendar on his wall, and every day he writes jokes, he marks the date with a big red X. He said, “After a few days, you’ll have a chain. Just keep going, and the chain will get longer. You’ll feel good seeing that chain, especially after a few weeks. Your only job is to not break the chain.”\n\nThis chain method became popular among writers and fitness fans because it helps them stick to their goals. It shows how to make deep work a regular habit. The idea is to create a rhythm for your work so you don’t have to waste energy deciding when to do it. The chain method is a great example of this because it combines a simple plan (do the work every day) with a visual reminder (the red Xs on the calendar).\n\nAnother way to use this rhythmic philosophy is to set a specific time each day for deep work. Just like seeing your progress can help you start working, having a set time can make it easier to dive into your tasks. For example, Brian Chappell, a busy doctoral student, used this method when he got a full-time job while also trying to write his dissertation. This job was a great opportunity, but with a new baby at home, it made it tough to find the time to focus on his writing.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Brad Isaac met Seinfeld and asked for advice on comedy. Seinfeld suggested writing jokes every day and using a calendar to track progress with red Xs. This method helps create a routine for deep work, making it easier to stay focused and productive.",
