  "text": "They talk about a master wheelwright, someone who used to make wooden wagon wheels. They say that every piece of wood is unique and has its own character. The wheelwright has a close connection with the wood he uses. He understands its special qualities and knows how to take care of them. This appreciation for the wood helps the craftsman find meaning in his work that goes beyond just himself. The value of the wood and the job it does isn’t something he makes up; it’s already there.\n\nDreyfus and Kelly explain that this sense of importance is common in craftsmanship. They say that a craftsman’s job isn’t to create meaning but to learn how to see the meaning that already exists. This helps the craftsman avoid feeling lost in a world where everything seems random. The meaning he finds feels more stable than what people believed in the past. For example, a wheelwright can’t use the quality of a piece of wood to support a bad government.\n\nWhen talking about job satisfaction, Dreyfus and Kelly’s view of craftsmanship helps us understand why people like Ric Furrer connect with their work. When Furrer looks happy while turning rough metals into art, it shows he appreciates something valuable in today’s world: a sense of the sacred.\n\nWe can relate this sense of sacredness in traditional craftsmanship to modern jobs that involve knowledge. First, it’s important to note that you don’t have to work with your hands to find this meaning. Any job, whether physical or mental, that requires a lot of skill can also feel sacred. \n\nTo explain this, let’s move from old crafts like woodworking to something modern like computer programming. Santiago Gonzalez, a talented coder, describes his work by saying that beautiful code is short and clear. If another programmer sees it, they would think, “Wow, that’s really well done.” It’s similar to writing a poem. \n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how craftsmanship, like wheelwrighting, provides a sense of meaning beyond the individual. It connects this idea to modern work, showing that any skilled job, including programming, can feel sacred and valuable."
