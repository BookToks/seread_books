But when a Harvard professor made them disconnect more often for a study, they were surprised to find out that being connected all the time wasn’t as important as they thought. Their clients didn’t need to reach them all the time, and the consultants actually did better work when they weren’t so distracted.\n\nI’ve also talked to some managers who believe they’re most helpful when they can quickly solve their team’s problems to keep projects moving. They think their job is to help others be productive, not just focus on their own work. But when we talked more, it became clear that they didn’t really need to be connected all the time to achieve this. Many software companies now use a method called Scrum for project management. This method cuts down on random messaging and replaces it with regular, organized meetings that are quick and efficient. These meetings help managers spend more time thinking about the challenges their teams face, which often leads to better results.\n\nIn short, while deep work is a valuable skill, it’s not the only one that matters in today’s job market. You can succeed without it, but those situations are getting less common. Unless you have strong reasons to believe that distractions are important for your job, it’s better to focus on doing deep work.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A group of consultants learned that constant email connectivity wasn't necessary for their work. Managers also found that structured meetings helped them focus better. Deep work is valuable, but distractions can be less important in many jobs today.",
