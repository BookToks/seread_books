They can’t learn fast.” Out of all the students who started the program with him, only half graduated on time. But Benn not only graduated; he was the top student in his class. His hard work paid off, and he quickly got a job as a developer at a tech start-up in San Francisco that had $25 million in funding and lots of job options. \n\nWhen Benn quit his job as a financial consultant just six months earlier, he was making $40,000 a year. His new job as a computer developer paid $100,000, and that amount can keep growing without limits in Silicon Valley, along with his skills. When I last talked to Benn, he was doing great in his new job. He loved deep work so much that he rented an apartment right across from his office. This way, he could get to work early and focus without distractions. He told me, “On good days, I can get in four hours of focus before the first meeting. Then maybe another three to four hours in the afternoon. And I do mean ‘focus’: no e-mail, no Hacker News, just programming.” It’s amazing how he changed from spending almost all his time online at his old job to being so focused now.\n\nJason Benn’s story shows an important lesson: Deep work isn’t just something old writers and thinkers talked about. It’s a valuable skill today. There are two main reasons why it’s so important. First, we live in an information economy that relies on complex systems that change fast. Some of the computer languages Benn learned didn’t even exist ten years ago, and they might be outdated in another ten years. Similarly, someone in marketing in the 1990s wouldn’t have known they’d need to learn digital analytics today. To stay valuable in our economy, you need to learn complicated things quickly, and that takes deep work. If you don’t develop this skill, you might fall behind as technology moves forward.\n\nThe second reason deep work is valuable is that the digital world has both good and bad sides. If you can create something useful, you can reach a huge audience, which means big rewards. But if what you make isn’t good, you’re in trouble because it’s easy for people to find better options online. Whether you’re a programmer, writer, marketer, consultant, or entrepreneur, \n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Benn's success shows that deep work is a valuable skill in today's fast-changing job market. It helps you learn quickly and create valuable work. If you don’t focus deeply, you risk falling behind as technology advances.",
