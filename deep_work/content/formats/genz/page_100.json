You should be able to finish just in time or really close, but it should take a lot of focus.\n\nThe main reason for this method is simple. Deep work needs way more focus than most people are used to. Roosevelt dashes use fake deadlines to help you get better at focusing, kind of like training your brain's attention skills.

It also shares a personal story about staying fit while commuting between Boston and Cambridge.",
