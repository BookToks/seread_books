  "simplified_text": "Don’t be surprised that focusing deeply on work is tough when we’re surrounded by distractions like tweets, likes, tagged photos, and posts that we feel we need to pay attention to just because they’re there. \n\nDeep work should be a top priority in today’s business world, but it often isn’t. There are a few reasons for this. First, deep work is hard, while shallow work is easy. Second, when you don’t have clear goals at work, it’s easy to get caught up in busy but unimportant tasks. Lastly, our culture tends to think that anything related to the Internet is good, even if it doesn’t help us create valuable things. All these trends make it hard to see how important deep work is or what we lose by ignoring it.\n\nIf you believe deep work is important, this is bad news for businesses because they might miss out on big chances to improve. But for you, there’s good news. Since many people and companies are focused on shallow work, deep work will become rarer and more valuable. Now that we know deep work is good and distractions aren’t necessary, you can confidently work on improving your ability to focus deeply, which will lead to great rewards.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Deep work is important but often overlooked in favor of distractions like social media. While this is bad for businesses, it creates a personal advantage for individuals. As deep work becomes rarer, it will be more valuable, so focusing on it can lead to great rewards.",
