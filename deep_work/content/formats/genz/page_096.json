  "text": "Write down the next time you can use the Internet. Until then, you can’t connect to the Internet at all, even if it’s super tempting.\n\nThe reason for this is that using distracting stuff doesn’t really stop your brain from focusing. It’s the constant jumping from boring, important tasks to exciting but useless ones that makes your brain unable to handle being bored. This constant switching is like making your brain weaker at focusing on what really matters. By limiting your Internet use, you’re cutting down on distractions, which helps your brain get better at focusing.\n\nFor example, if you know you can use the Internet in thirty minutes and you start feeling bored, that time becomes a chance to practice focusing. So, a whole day of planned distractions turns into a day of training your brain to concentrate.\n\nEven though this idea is simple, actually doing it can be hard. Here are three key points to help you out.\n\nPoint #1: This plan works even if your job needs you to be online a lot or reply to emails quickly. \n\nIf you have to spend a lot of time online or answer emails fast, that’s okay. It just means you’ll have more Internet breaks than someone whose job needs less online time. What matters is keeping your offline time strong. \n\nFor example, if you have two hours between meetings and need to check emails every fifteen minutes for about five minutes, you can schedule an Internet break every fifteen minutes. This way, you’ll spend about ninety minutes offline and practicing focusing without losing too much time online.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** This passage explains how to improve focus by scheduling Internet use and limiting distractions. It emphasizes the importance of resisting the urge to check online frequently, even if your job requires it, to strengthen your ability to concentrate."
