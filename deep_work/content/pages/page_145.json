  "simplified_text": "Herbert uses filters to help him connect with people and find cool opportunities. But these filters also make sure he only gets messages he can easily manage.\n\nFor example, Antonio Centeno runs a popular blog called Real Man Style. He has a special way of handling questions. If you want to ask him something, you have to post it in a public spot first. He thinks it’s a waste of time to answer the same questions over and over in private chats. If you get through that step, you have to agree to three promises by clicking checkboxes:\n\n1. I won’t ask Antonio a style question I could find on Google in 10 minutes.\n2. I won’t spam Antonio with a random request to promote my business.\n3. I’ll do something nice for a stranger if Antonio replies within 23 hours.\n\nYou can only type your message after you check all three boxes.\n\nIn short, email technology is changing the game, but the way we use it isn’t great yet. It’s silly to think all messages should be treated the same and that every message needs a quick reply. The sender filter is a helpful step towards fixing this, especially for entrepreneurs and freelancers who get a lot of messages and want to control their time better. It would also be great to see similar rules in big companies, but we’re probably not there yet.\n\nIf you can, think about using sender filters to take back some control over your time and focus.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Herbert and Antonio Centeno use filters to manage messages better. These filters help them focus on important communication and save time. The idea of sender filters is useful for busy people and could improve email communication overall.",
