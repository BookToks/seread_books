  "simplified_text": "“Hey, do you want to grab coffee?”\n\nE-mail #2: “We should get back to the research problem we talked about last time. Where are we with that?”\n\nE-mail #3: “I worked on that article we discussed. It’s attached. What do you think?”\n\nThese three examples are pretty common for people who work with information. They show the kind of messages that fill up our inboxes. But they can also be tricky: how you reply can really affect how much time and focus the conversation takes later.\n\nWhen you get emails like these, your first instinct might be to quickly reply just to get it out of your inbox. A fast response gives you a little relief because it shifts the responsibility back to the sender. But this relief doesn’t last long, as the responsibility will keep coming back, wasting your time and energy. So, I suggest taking a moment before replying to think about this important question: What is the project this message is about, and what’s the best way to finish it without sending too many emails?\n\nOnce you’ve thought about it, instead of a quick reply, take the time to explain the process you figured out, mention what step you’re on, and highlight what needs to happen next. I call this the process-centric approach to email, and it helps reduce the number of emails you get and the mental clutter they create.\n\nTo better understand this approach, here are some process-centric replies to the earlier emails:\n\nProcess-Centric Response to E-mail #1: “I’d love to grab coffee! Let’s meet at the Starbucks on campus. I’ve listed two days next week when I’m free, with three times for each day. If any of those work for you, let me know, and I’ll take that as a confirmation. If none of those times work, just call me at the number below, and we can figure out a time that does. Looking forward to it!”\n\nProcess-Centric Response to E-mail #2: “I agree we should get back to this problem. Here’s what I suggest…”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how to handle emails effectively, especially those that ask questions. It suggests taking time to think about the project and how to respond in a way that minimizes future emails and mental clutter. Using a process-centric approach can help manage communication better.",
