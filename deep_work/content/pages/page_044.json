  "simplified_text": "Chapter Three  \nDeep Work Is Meaningful  \n\nRic Furrer is a blacksmith who focuses on old-school metalworking techniques. He carefully recreates these methods in his shop called Door County Forgeworks. “I do all my work by hand and use tools that help me work better without stopping my creativity or connection with the metal,” he says in his artist’s statement. “What might take me 100 hits by hand can be done in one hit with a big machine. This is the opposite of what I want, and all my work shows that it was made by my two hands.”  \n\nA 2012 PBS documentary gives us a look into Furrer’s life. He works in a barn in the Wisconsin countryside, not far from the beautiful Sturgeon Bay on Lake Michigan. Furrer often leaves the barn doors open to let out the heat from the forges. The view is beautiful, but the work can look tough at first. In the documentary, Furrer is trying to make a Viking sword. He starts by using a 1,500-year-old method to create crucible steel, which is a very pure form of metal for that time. The result is a block of metal, not much bigger than three or four stacked smartphones. This heavy block needs to be shaped and polished into a long, nice sword blade.  \n\n“This part, the initial breakdown, is terrible,” Furrer says to the camera as he carefully heats the block, hits it with a hammer, turns it, hits it again, and puts it back in the flames to start over. The narrator reveals that it will take eight hours of hammering to finish shaping it. However, as you watch Furrer work, you see that he’s not just mindlessly hitting the metal like a miner. Every hit is strong but very controlled. He looks closely at the metal through thin glasses that seem out of place with his heavy beard and broad shoulders, turning it just right for each hit. “You have to be very gentle with it or you will crack it,” he explains. After a few more hits, he adds, “You have to nudge it; slowly it breaks down; then you start to enjoy it.”  \n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Ric Furrer is a skilled blacksmith who uses ancient techniques to create metalwork by hand. He works in a barn in Wisconsin and focuses on making a Viking sword using a special type of steel. His process is tough but requires careful control, showing the beauty in hard work.",
