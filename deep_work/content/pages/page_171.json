You can check it out online. \n\nThere’s a problem where we’re losing our ability to explain things clearly. This idea comes from a book by John Freeman called \"The Tyranny of E-mail.\" \n\nIf you want to see how I manage my emails, you can visit my website. I once emailed Cal to ask him something, and that’s mentioned in an article by Jocelyn Glei about dealing with too many messages. \n\nAt some point, too many people start reaching out, and there’s more info on Clay Herbert and Antonio Centeno’s email filters in a Forbes article. I even helped come up with the term “sender filter” for that article, written by my friend Michael Simmons. \n\nYou can also see how Antonio uses his filters on his website. Tim Ferriss talks about how to let small problems happen instead of stressing over everything in his blog. \n\nIn the conclusion, there’s a quote about how focus is what made Bill Gates stand out from others. This info comes from an article by Walter Isaacson and his book \"The Innovators.\" I also got some background from Stephen Manes’s biography of Gates. \n\nIf you want to see my computer science work, you can find it on my academic website. I list my publications by year, and most of us in this field publish in conferences instead of journals. \n\nFinally, I want to live a focused life, as mentioned in another book by Gallagher.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Radhika Nagpal's work is highlighted in a science magazine. The text discusses how we struggle to communicate clearly due to email overload and emphasizes the importance of focus, using Bill Gates as an example. It also mentions managing emails and academic publications.",
