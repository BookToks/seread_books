  "simplified_text": "When someone asks me to do something that takes a lot of time, I try to keep it simple. If I say no because I have other trips planned, I don’t give too many details. I just say, “Sounds interesting, but I can’t make it because of schedule conflicts.” I also avoid offering to help in other ways that could take up my time, like saying, “Sorry I can’t join your committee, but I can look at your proposals and give my thoughts.” It’s better to just say no clearly.\n\nI’m really careful about how I manage my time. Since I only have so many hours in a day, I can’t let big deadlines sneak up on me or waste my mornings on unimportant stuff. If I don’t plan smartly, I might end up wasting time. Having a set schedule helps me stay organized. Without that pressure, I’d probably get lazy.\n\nTo sum it up, both Nagpal and I can do well in school without overloading ourselves for two reasons. First, we cut out the less important stuff while keeping the important things. This helps us have more time without losing the value of what we create. In fact, cutting out the less important tasks gives us more energy for the important ones, so we can actually do more than if we had a packed schedule. Second, having limits on our time makes us think more carefully about how we organize our work, which helps us produce more than if we just worked longer hours without a plan.\n\nThe main idea is that this approach can help anyone in knowledge-based jobs, not just professors. Even if you’re not in academia, sticking to a fixed schedule can be really beneficial. It’s easy to say yes to small commitments that seem harmless, like grabbing coffee or jumping on a call. But when you commit to a fixed schedule, you start to see these extra obligations as potentially disruptive. You begin to say no more often, making it harder for people to take up your time. This also makes you rethink what you thought was normal in your workplace, like getting emails from your boss after hours.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage explains how managing time wisely and saying no to less important tasks can help boost productivity. By focusing on what truly matters, anyone can improve their work efficiency and challenge workplace norms.",
