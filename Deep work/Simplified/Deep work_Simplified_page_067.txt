Chappell started by trying to do deep work in a pretty loose way. He made a rule that deep work should happen in ninety-minute blocks because it takes time to really focus. He planned to fit these blocks into his schedule whenever he had free time. But this didn’t help him get much done. The year before, at a writing camp, he had finished a whole thesis chapter in one week by working hard. But after starting his full-time job, he only finished one chapter in the whole first year.

The slow progress made Chappell switch to a new plan called the rhythmic method. He decided to wake up and start working by 5:30 every morning. He would work until 7:30, then make breakfast and go to his job, already done with his dissertation work for the day. Seeing good results, he even started waking up at 4:45 to get more deep work done in the morning.

When I talked to Chappell, he said his rhythmic schedule was “super productive and guilt free.” He was writing four to five pages a day and could finish a thesis chapter every two or three weeks. This was amazing for someone who also worked a regular job. He asked, “Why can’t I be that productive?” The rhythmic method is different from the bimodal method. It might not reach the highest levels of deep focus that long, intense sessions can give. But it fits better with how people actually live. By sticking to a steady routine that gets a little done every day, rhythmic workers often get more deep work done overall.

Choosing between rhythmic and bimodal depends on how much self-control you have. If you’re someone like Carl Jung, who was fighting hard to prove ideas, you’ll probably find time to focus easily. But if you’re writing a paper with no pressure, the steady daily habit of the rhythmic method might be what you need to keep going.

For many people, the choice isn’t just about self-control. Some jobs don’t let you disappear for days to focus deeply when you need to. So, the rhythmic method often works better in real life.
