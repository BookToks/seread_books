Because of these dangers, you might think that more people who work with computers or write for a living would avoid social media—especially those whose jobs depend on focusing deeply. But what makes social media tricky is that the companies making money from your attention have done a great job convincing everyone that if you don’t use their apps, you’ll miss out on something important.

This fear of missing out is like when Nicodemus was scared to throw away stuff in his closets because he thought it might be useful someday. That’s why I suggest a plan like his “packing party.” Try spending a month without social media. This can help you stop worrying about missing events, chats, or popular trends. Most people find out that, once they’re free from all the ads and hype, social media isn’t actually that important in their lives.

I ask you not to tell anyone about your 30-day break because some people stay hooked on social media because they think others really want to hear what they say. They worry their followers will be upset if they suddenly stop sharing. I’m joking a bit, but this feeling is real and worth thinking about. For example, right now, the average Twitter user has 208 followers. When you know over two hundred people want to listen to you, it’s easy to feel like your posts matter a lot. I say this from experience, since I try to make a living by sharing my ideas online: it’s super addictive!

But here’s the truth about audiences on social media. Before these apps existed, getting a big audience outside your close friends and family took a lot of hard work. In the early 2000s, anyone could start a blog, but even getting a few visitors each month meant you had to work hard to share something valuable. I know this well. I started my first blog in 2003 called Inspiring Moniker, where I wrote about being a 21-year-old college student. Honestly, there were long times when no one read it at all. Over the next ten years, I slowly built my current blog, Study Hacks, from just a few readers to hundreds of thousands each month. I learned that getting people’s attention online takes a lot of patient and hard work.
