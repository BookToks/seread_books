1. Spend real time with the people who matter most to me (like having long talks, sharing meals, or doing things together).

2. Make sacrifices that help improve the lives of those important to me.

Not everyone will have this exact goal or do these activities, but many people will relate to it. Now, let’s think about Facebook using this idea. Facebook gives you lots of benefits for your social life. For example, you can catch up with people you haven’t seen in a while, keep in touch with people you don’t see often, see important updates about friends (like if they got married or had a baby), and find online groups that match your interests.

These are real benefits, but they don’t really help with the two main things we said: spending real time and making sacrifices for people. Both of these need offline effort. So, the strategy here would say: Facebook helps your social life, but not enough to deserve your time and attention.

I’m not saying everyone should stop using Facebook. I’m just showing that for this example, the best choice might be to quit it. But there are other cases where using Facebook makes sense. For example, a college freshman might want to make lots of new friends by going to events and meeting people. For them, Facebook could really help and should be used.

Another example is a soldier overseas. Staying in touch with family and friends back home might be very important, and social networks like Facebook can help a lot.

The main point is this: if you use this strategy, many people might stop using Facebook or Twitter, but not everyone will.
