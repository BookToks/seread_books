In the movie Good Will Hunting, Matt Damon’s character cries because he quickly solves math problems that even the smartest people can’t figure out. The idea that being naturally talented is the main reason for success is actually a myth. Research by Ericsson, which most experts now agree with (with some exceptions), shows that to get really good at something hard, you need a special kind of practice called deliberate practice. Very few people get exceptions because of natural talent. A long time ago, a thinker named Sertillanges said something similar: that even geniuses became great by working hard on what they decided to focus on. Ericsson’s idea matches this perfectly.

So, what does deliberate practice really need? First, you have to focus all your attention on one specific skill or idea you want to get better at. Second, you need feedback so you can fix your mistakes and keep improving. The first part—focusing without getting distracted—is super important. Ericsson says that letting your attention wander is the opposite of what deliberate practice needs.

Psychologists like Ericsson aren’t really trying to figure out why deliberate practice works, just that it does. But in the years since Ericsson’s research, brain scientists have been studying what happens in your brain when you get better at something hard. Journalist Daniel Coyle explains in his book The Talent Code that a key part is myelin. Myelin is a fatty layer that wraps around brain cells called neurons. It works like insulation, letting your brain cells send signals faster and more smoothly. When you learn a skill, your brain builds circuits for it. Getting better means adding more myelin to these circuits, so they work easier and faster. Being great at something means having well-covered brain circuits with myelin.

This is important because it shows why deliberate practice works in your brain. When you focus hard on a skill, the brain circuit for that skill fires over and over without distractions. This repeats signals that tell special cells called oligodendrocytes to wrap more myelin around the neurons, making the skill stronger and more automatic. That’s why it’s so important to focus deeply and avoid distractions during practice—only then can your brain’s circuits improve the most.
