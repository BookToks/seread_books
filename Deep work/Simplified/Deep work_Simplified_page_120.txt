If he needed something that was packed, he would take it out and then put it back where it belonged. At the end of the week, he saw that most of his stuff was still untouched in its boxes.

So he got rid of it.

People keep a lot of stuff because they worry, “What if I need this someday?” and use that as an excuse to hold on to things. Nicodemus’s packing party showed him that most of his stuff wasn’t needed, which helped him simplify his life.

The last method gave a way to start sorting through the network tools that take up your time and attention. This new method is different but works well with the first one, inspired by how Ryan Nicodemus got rid of stuff he didn’t need.

This method asks you to do the same thing with social media that Nicodemus did with his stuff. Instead of packing, you stop using all your social media for thirty days. That means Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and any other services you use. Don’t deactivate your accounts, and don’t tell people you’re stopping—just quit cold turkey. If someone asks why you’re not active, you can explain, but don’t make a big deal about it.

After thirty days without social media, ask yourself two questions about each service: 1. Would my last month have been better if I used this service?

2. Did people notice or care that I wasn’t using it?

If you answer “no” to both, quit that service for good. If you answer “yes,” go back to using it. If your answers are unclear, it’s your choice, but it’s better to quit. You can always come back later.

This method focuses on social media because these apps can use up a lot of your time and make it hard to concentrate. They send you random updates that keep you hooked, making it tough to focus and get things done.
