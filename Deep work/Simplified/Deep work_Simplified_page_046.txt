No one would blame Ric Furrer for not using Facebook, but if someone who works with knowledge does the same, people might think they’re a bit strange (I know this from my own experience).

Just because the link between doing deep work and finding meaning isn’t obvious in knowledge jobs, doesn’t mean it’s not there. The goal of this chapter is to show you that deep work can bring as much satisfaction in an information-based job as it does in hands-on crafts. In the next sections, I’ll give three reasons to support this idea. These reasons go from a narrow view to a broader one: starting with the brain, then the mind, and finally big life ideas. I’ll prove that no matter how you look at it, choosing deep work over shallow tasks helps you find the same kind of meaning that people like Ric Furrer get from their work. So, the main idea of this last chapter in Part 1 is that living deeply isn’t just good for making money, but it’s also a good way to live your life.

A Brain Reason for Depth  
Science writer Winifred Gallagher found a link between paying attention and being happy after a scary event—a cancer diagnosis. She explains it wasn’t just any cancer, but a bad, advanced kind. After leaving the hospital, she suddenly realized: “This disease wants all my attention, but I will try to focus on my life instead.” Even though her cancer treatment was hard and tiring, she noticed that focusing on the good things—like movies, walks, and a 6:30 martini—actually helped her feel better. Her life during that time could have been full of fear and sadness, but instead, she often felt pretty good.

Curious about this, Gallagher studied how attention—what we choose to focus on and what we ignore—affects how good our life feels. After five years of research, she became sure that managing attention well is like a “grand unified theory” of the mind. Different fields, from anthropology to economics, all suggest that being able to control your attention is the most important skill for a good life and for making almost every part of your experience better.
