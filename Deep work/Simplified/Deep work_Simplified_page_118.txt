You might feel like it’s unfair to only focus on a few activities when deciding how to use your time or tools. For example, Facebook can be really good for your social life, so why stop using it just because it doesn’t help with the small number of activities we think are most important? The important thing to know is that focusing on just a few priorities isn’t random. This idea comes up a lot in different areas, like making money, fairness in society, and even fixing computer problems.

There’s something called the Law of the Vital Few. It means that in many cases, about 80% of an effect comes from just 20% of the causes.

For example, 80% of a business’s profits might come from only 20% of its customers. Or 80% of a country’s wealth might be owned by the richest 20% of people. Even 80% of computer crashes can come from only 20% of the bugs. This rule is based on math, but it’s mostly useful as a reminder that not all causes or actions have the same impact.

Let’s say this law applies to your important life goals. Many activities can help you reach those goals, but the law tells us that about 20% of those activities give you most of the benefit. If you have around 10 to 15 different things you could do for your goals, this rule says the top 2 or 3 are the ones that really make a difference in whether you succeed.

Even if you agree with this, you might think you shouldn’t ignore the other 80% of activities. They might not help as much, but they still help a bit, so why not do some of them too? As long as you don’t forget the most important ones, it seems like it wouldn’t hurt to do the less important ones as well.

But this misses the main point: all activities take your limited time and attention. If you spend time on less important activities, you’re losing time you could use for the more important ones.
