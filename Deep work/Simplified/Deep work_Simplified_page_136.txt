You might be wondering if a college graduate needs to be really good at the project’s topic to join a planning meeting. Probably not. These meetings usually don’t get into the details. Instead, people chat a lot and try to look like they’re busy without actually doing much. A smart recent graduate could learn how to join these meetings in about three months. So, let’s say it takes three months to get ready for this kind of meeting.

This question is just for thinking—it doesn’t mean you should actually hire a new grad for easy tasks. But it helps you figure out how deep or simple different jobs are. If it takes many months for a new grad to learn a task, that means the task needs special skills. Tasks that need your skills are “deep” tasks. They’re good because they give you more value for your time and help you get better. On the other hand, if a new grad can learn a task quickly, it’s a “shallow” task that doesn’t need special skills.

What should you do with this idea? Once you know which of your tasks are deep or shallow, spend more time on the deep ones. For example, the first task in the case studies is worth your time, but the second and third ones aren’t. They might feel like work, but they don’t give much value for the time you spend.

It’s not always easy to spend less time on shallow tasks and more on deep ones, even if you can tell which is which. That’s why the next part gives you tips on how to do this better.

Ask your boss how much time you should spend on shallow work. This is a question that hardly anyone asks. If you have a boss, talk to them about what percentage of your time should go to shallow work. You might need to explain what “shallow” and “deep” work means first. If you work for yourself, ask yourself this question. Then, decide on an amount of time for shallow work and try to stick to it.
