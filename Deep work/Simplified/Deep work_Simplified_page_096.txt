Until that time comes, don’t use the internet at all—no matter how much you want to.

The main idea here is that just using a distracting service doesn’t make it harder to focus. What really hurts your focus is switching all the time between boring, important tasks and fun, distracting stuff whenever you get a little bored. This constant switching teaches your brain to always want something new. It’s like making the part of your brain that controls attention weaker. By keeping internet use separate from other times, you stop yourself from getting distracted so often, and this helps make your focus stronger.

For example, if you plan to use the internet in thirty minutes, and you start feeling bored now, resisting the urge to go online for those thirty minutes is like exercising your brain’s focus muscles. Doing this all day is like giving your brain a full workout.

The idea is simple, but doing it can be hard. To help, here are three important things to remember.

Point #1: This method works even if your job needs you to be online a lot or answer emails quickly.

If you have to spend hours online or reply to emails fast, that’s okay. It just means you’ll have more internet blocks than someone who doesn’t need to be online as much. What matters most is that you don’t break the times when you’re supposed to be offline.

For example, if you have two hours between meetings and need to check email every fifteen minutes, and each check takes about five minutes, just plan internet time every fifteen minutes during those two hours. The rest of the time, stay offline. In this case, you’ll spend about ninety minutes of those two hours offline and practicing focus. This way, you get a lot of brain training without losing important online time.
