Some of these people are really successful at their jobs, he told me, but it wasn’t because they went to a fancy school. It was because they studied every day, starting as early as fifth grade. After a while, Marlin noticed he was getting better at thinking deeply. He said, “Lately, I’ve been coming up with more creative ideas at work. I believe it’s because of this daily mental practice. Practicing like this over many years has made my brain stronger. I didn’t plan for this to happen, but it did.”

Adam Marlin’s story shows something important about deep work: being able to focus really well is a skill you have to practice. This might seem obvious when you hear it, but most people don’t think about it this way. Usually, people treat focusing like flossing your teeth—something you know you should do but don’t because you’re not motivated. This way of thinking makes it seem like you can suddenly change from being distracted to focused just by trying harder. But that ignores how hard focusing really is and how much practice it takes to build your “mental muscle.” The creative ideas Adam Marlin has now don’t come from just deciding to think deeper once. They come from training his brain every morning for a long time.

There’s also another important idea: if you want to focus better, you have to stop depending on distractions. Just like athletes need to take care of their bodies outside of training, you won’t be able to concentrate deeply if you always run away from being even a little bored.

We can see proof of this in the work of Clifford Nass, a late Stanford professor who studied how people behave with technology. His research showed that switching your attention all the time online hurts your brain in the long run. In a 2010 interview, Nass said it’s easy to separate people into those who multitask a lot and those who don’t, and the differences between them are huge.
