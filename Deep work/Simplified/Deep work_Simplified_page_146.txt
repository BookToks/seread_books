Do you want to grab coffee?” Email #2: “We should get back to the research problem we talked about last time. Can you remind me where we left off?” Email #3: “I tried writing that article we discussed. It’s attached. What do you think?” These three emails are things most office workers see a lot. They show the kinds of messages filling their inboxes. But they can also cause problems with getting work done: how you reply can affect how much time and energy the conversation takes.

Emails like these, which ask questions, make you want to reply quickly just to get them out of your inbox. A fast reply might help a little at first because you’re sending the job back to the other person. But this feeling won’t last, because the responsibility will keep coming back, taking up your time and focus. So, I suggest that when you get a question like this, you stop for a moment before answering. Think about this: What project is this message about, and what’s the best way to finish this project with as few emails as possible?

After you figure this out, don’t just answer quickly. Instead, send a reply that explains the plan you came up with, shows what step you’re on now, and says what comes next. I call this the process-focused way to handle emails. It helps you get fewer emails and keeps your mind less cluttered.

To show why this works, here are some process-focused replies to the example emails from before: Reply to Email #1: “I’d love to grab coffee. Let’s meet at the Starbucks on campus. I’m free on two days next week, and for each day, I listed three times. If any of these work for you, just let me know. Your reply will confirm the meeting. If none work, call me at the number below, and we’ll find a time that does. Looking forward to it.” Reply to Email #2: “I agree we should get back to this problem. Here’s what I suggest…”
