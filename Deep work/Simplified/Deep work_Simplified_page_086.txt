Studies like this one helped Dijksterhuis and his team come up with unconscious thought theory (UTT). This idea tries to explain how our conscious and unconscious minds work differently when we make decisions.

Basically, UTT says that when you need to follow strict rules, like doing math, you have to use your conscious mind. Your conscious mind can handle exact steps to get the right answer. But for decisions with lots of information and unclear or mixed rules, your unconscious mind is better. UTT thinks this is because your unconscious brain can handle more information at once and look at more possible answers than your conscious mind.

According to the theory, your conscious mind is like a home computer running specific programs that solve clear problems. Your unconscious mind is like Google’s huge data centers, using smart algorithms to sort through tons of messy data and find useful solutions.

This research suggests that letting your conscious mind rest gives your unconscious mind a chance to work on your hardest problems. So taking breaks doesn’t mean you’re working less; it means you’re letting your brain use different ways to solve problems.

Reason #2: Downtime helps you recharge the energy needed to focus deeply. A well-known 2008 study split people into two groups. One group walked through a forest near the University of Michigan, while the other walked through a busy city center. Afterward, both groups did a tough focus test called backward digit-span.

The study found that the nature group did up to 20% better on the test. When the study repeated the next week with groups switching places, the results were the same. It showed that it wasn’t who the people were but whether they got to walk in nature that helped them focus better.
