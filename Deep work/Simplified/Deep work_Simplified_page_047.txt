This idea changes how most people think about their personal experience of life. We usually believe that what happens to us controls how we feel. From this view, the small things during your day don’t matter much. What really counts are big things, like getting a promotion or moving to a nicer place.

But Gallagher says that years of research show this isn’t true. Our brains build how we see the world based on what we pay attention to. If you focus on something bad, like a cancer diagnosis, your life feels sad and dark. But if you focus on something nice, like having a relaxing evening drink, your life feels better—even if nothing else changes. Gallagher sums it up: “Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love—is the sum of what you focus on.” In her book Rapt, she looks at the research that supports this idea.

She talks about Barbara Fredrickson, a psychologist at the University of North Carolina who studies how we think about emotions.

After something bad happens, Fredrickson’s research shows that what you choose to focus on can really affect your mood going forward.

These simple choices can act like a “reset button” for your feelings. For example, if you and your partner are fighting over chores, instead of focusing on how selfish or lazy they are, you could focus on the fact that you’re finally talking about the problem. This is the first step to fixing it and feeling better. This might sound like just “looking on the bright side,” but Fredrickson found that using these emotional “leverage points” can actually lead to much better results after bad events.

Scientists can see this effect happening in the brain. For example, Laura Carstensen, a psychologist at Stanford, used an fMRI scanner to watch people’s brain activity when they saw good or bad pictures. She found that young people’s amygdala (a part of the brain that handles emotions) reacted to both good and bad pictures. But in older people, the amygdala only reacted to the good pictures. Carstensen thinks older people’s brains have learned to block out the bad stuff and focus on the good. They aren’t happier because their lives are better than young people’s; they’re happier because their brains have been trained to ignore negatives and enjoy positives. By controlling what they pay attention to, they made their world better without changing anything real.
