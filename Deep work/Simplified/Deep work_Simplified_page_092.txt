Rule #2: Learn to Deal with Boredom

To understand how people get really good at focusing deeply, I suggest visiting the Knesses Yisroel Synagogue in Spring Valley, New York, at six a.m. on a weekday. If you go, you’ll probably see at least twenty cars in the parking lot.

Inside, you’ll find about twenty people studying texts. Some might be reading quietly, moving their lips in an ancient language. Others are paired up, arguing or discussing ideas. At one side of the room, a rabbi leads a bigger group in a talk. This early morning meeting is just a small part of the hundreds of thousands of orthodox Jews who wake up early every weekday to practice a big part of their faith: spending time each day studying the complicated written traditions of Rabbinic Judaism.

I learned about this from Adam Marlin, a member of the Knesses Yisroel group and a regular at the morning study sessions. Marlin told me that his goal is to understand one page of the Talmud every day (though sometimes he can’t finish). He often studies with a partner to really push his thinking to the limit.

What interests me about Marlin is not his knowledge of old texts, but the effort it takes to get that knowledge. When I talked to him, he said his morning study is very intense. “It’s a serious, tough discipline, mostly the kind of ‘deep work’ you write about,” he said.

“I run a growing business, but this is often the hardest thinking I do.” This hard thinking isn’t just for Marlin—it’s part of the whole practice. His rabbi once told him, “You can’t say you did your daily duty unless you pushed your brain to its limits.” Unlike many orthodox Jews, Marlin didn’t start this hard Talmud study until he was in his twenties. This is helpful to know because it lets Marlin compare his brain before and after starting the practice—and the result surprised him. Even though Marlin had three Ivy League degrees when he began, he soon met others who went to only small religious schools but could still “dance intellectual circles” around him.
