Second, it helped me understand how many hours of focused work I really needed to get results. It turned out to be more than I first thought, which made me try to fit more deep work hours into each week.

Discipline #4: Create a Rhythm of Accountability The 4DX authors explain that the last step to stay focused on important tasks is to have regular meetings with your team if you have one. In these meetings, everyone looks at their progress, promises specific actions to improve before the next meeting, and talks about what happened with their last promises. These meetings can be short but need to happen often to work well. The authors say this is where the real work gets done.

If you work alone, you might not have a team to meet with, but you still need to check in with yourself regularly. In the book, I suggest doing a weekly review where you plan your work for the week ahead (see Rule #4). When I tried 4DX, I used weekly reviews to check my progress, celebrate good weeks, figure out what went wrong in bad weeks, and plan how to do better. This helped me change my schedule to fit more deep work time than if I hadn’t done these reviews.

The 4DX system is based on the idea that doing work is harder than making plans. After studying many cases, the creators found a few simple habits that help people get things done. It’s not surprising these habits can also help you build a strong deep work routine.

To finish, let me share my story again. When I started using 4DX, my goal was to publish five peer-reviewed papers in the 2013–2014 school year. This was a big goal because I had only published four papers the year before, which I was proud of. During my 4DX experiment, having a clear goal and a simple progress tracker pushed me to work more deeply than I ever had before. Looking back, it wasn’t that I worked harder during each deep work session, but that I did these sessions more regularly. Before, I mostly focused deeply near paper deadlines, but 4DX helped me keep my mind focused all year long.
