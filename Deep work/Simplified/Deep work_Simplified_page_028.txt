What About Jack Dorsey?

I’ve explained why deep work helps develop skills that are becoming more important in today’s economy. But before we agree with this idea, we need to answer a common question: What about Jack Dorsey?

Jack Dorsey helped start Twitter. After he stopped being CEO, he started Square, a company for handling payments. A Forbes article called him a “disrupter on a massive scale.” He doesn’t spend much time doing deep work. When the article was written, he was still managing both Twitter (as chairman) and Square, so his schedule was very busy and split up a lot, making it hard to focus deeply.

For example, Dorsey said he finishes each day with 30 to 40 sets of meeting notes to go through at night. In the small breaks between meetings, he likes to be available for random chats. “I do a lot of my work at stand-up tables, which anyone can come up to,” he said. “I get to hear all these conversations around the company.” This way of working isn’t deep. Using a term from before, Dorsey’s attention is all over the place as he jumps from meeting to meeting and lets people interrupt him often. But even so, we can’t say his work is shallow. Shallow work means low value and easy to copy, but what Dorsey does is very valuable and highly rewarded. At the time of writing, he was one of the richest people in the world, worth over $1.1 billion.

Jack Dorsey is important to talk about because he represents a group we can’t ignore: people who do well without deep focus. When I asked “What About Jack Dorsey?,” I was giving a specific example of a bigger question: If deep work is so important, then why do some distracted people succeed? I want to answer this question now so it doesn’t bother you as we learn more about deep work later.

First, we have to remember that Jack Dorsey is a top executive in a big company—actually two companies.
