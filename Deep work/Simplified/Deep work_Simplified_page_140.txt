“I do certain things on purpose to keep myself happy.” Because of this, Nagpal really enjoyed her time before getting tenure. She shared some examples of how she did this, but one idea should sound familiar. At the start of her career, she tried to fit work into every free moment from 7 a.m. to midnight. Since she has kids, evenings were often broken up. She soon realized this was not a good plan, so she decided to work no more than fifty hours a week. Then she figured out what rules and habits she needed to make that happen. In other words, she used a fixed schedule to stay productive.

We know this plan didn’t hurt her career because she got tenure on time and became a full professor just three years later, which is really fast. How did she do it? One big way was by limiting shallow tasks—those small, urgent jobs that don’t matter much. For example, she only traveled five times a year. Trips can bring lots of quick, annoying tasks like booking hotels or preparing talks. For most professors, five trips a year is not much. Her old coworker Matt Welsh said junior professors often travel 12 to 24 times a year. So Nagpal avoided a lot of extra work by traveling less. This travel limit was just one of her ways to control her work. She also set limits on things like how many papers she would review each year. All her rules helped her cut down on shallow tasks so she could focus on deep, important work like original research, which really decided her success.

I do something similar to succeed with fixed scheduling. I’m very careful about saying “yes,” the most dangerous word when it comes to staying productive. It takes a lot to get me to agree to shallow work. If someone asks me to do university stuff that isn’t super important, I might say what my department chair once told me: “Talk to me after tenure.” Another trick I use is to say no clearly but be vague about why. This way, the person asking can’t argue or try to change my mind easily.
