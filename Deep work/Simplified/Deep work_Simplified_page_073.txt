It’s also just a couple of blocks away from Edinburgh Castle—one of the places that inspired Rowling to imagine Hogwarts.

Rowling choosing to stay in a fancy hotel room near Edinburgh Castle is an example of something called a “grand gesture.” This idea is simple: by changing your usual place a lot and maybe spending a lot of money or effort, you make the task feel more important. When a task feels more important, your brain is less likely to put it off, and you get more motivation and energy.

Writing a chapter of a Harry Potter book is hard and takes a lot of brain power, no matter where you do it. But if you pay over $1,000 a day to write in a cool hotel suite near a castle like Hogwarts, it’s easier to start and keep working than if you were in a noisy home office.

When you look at how other famous people focus deeply, you see this “grand gesture” idea a lot. Bill Gates, for example, used to take “Think Weeks” where he left his normal job and family behind to go to a cabin with lots of papers and books. He wanted to think without distractions about big problems for his company. During one of these weeks, he realized the Internet would be very important. He could have thought deeply in his office at Microsoft, but changing his place helped him focus better.

Alan Lightman, a scientist and writer, also uses grand gestures. Every summer, he goes to a tiny island in Maine to think and relax. Back in 2000, he said the island didn’t even have Internet or phone. He explained it was a time to find quiet, which is really hard to get. Not everyone can spend two months on an island, but many writers, like Dan Pink and Michael Pollan, create their own quiet places by building special writing cabins on their land, even if it costs a lot.

Pollan even wrote a book about building his cabin in the woods behind his old home in Connecticut. These cabins aren’t absolutely needed since writers just need a laptop and a desk, but having a special place helps them focus.
