This is because he’s famous, so if his book is really good, big media outlets will talk about it a lot. Because of this, it makes more sense for him to focus on writing the best book he can instead of trying to get a few extra sales by promoting it himself. So, the real question isn’t if Twitter is helpful for Lewis, but whether using Twitter actually helps the most important parts of his work.

If half of those people become loyal fans who will buy the next book, that’s about two thousand sales over two years—the time it might take to write the book. That’s a small increase compared to how many sales you need to become a bestseller. So again, the question isn’t if Twitter has some benefits, but if those benefits are big enough to be worth the time and focus it takes, which are really important for a writer.

Now that we’ve looked at this for work, let’s think about personal goals, especially using a popular and often defended tool: Facebook.
