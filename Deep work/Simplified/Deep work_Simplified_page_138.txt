In the end, a business’s main goal is to create value, not just to make work easy for its employees.

If you work for yourself, this exercise will show you how little time in your busy schedule is actually spent creating value. Seeing these hard numbers will give you the confidence to cut back on the less important tasks that waste your time. Without these numbers, it’s hard for an entrepreneur to say no to anything that might help them. You might think, “I have to be on Twitter,” or “I need to keep my Facebook active,” or “I should keep fixing things on my blog.” Saying no to any of these feels like being lazy. But if you set a balance between shallow and deep work, you can stop feeling guilty and focus on making the most of your shallow work time. This way, you still get chances to grow your business but also save enough time for the deep work that really moves things forward.

Sometimes, when you ask how much time you should spend on shallow work, the answer can be clear. No boss will say, “Spend all your time on shallow tasks!” (unless you’re just starting out). But a boss might say something like, “Do as much shallow work as needed to handle what we need from you right now.” This answer is still helpful because it shows that your job doesn’t support deep work. And a job that doesn’t support deep work won’t help you succeed in today’s world. If that’s the case, thank your boss for being honest and start planning how to move to a job that values deep work.

In the week before I wrote this, I took part in sixty-five different email conversations. Out of those, I only sent five emails after 5:30 p.m. This shows that, most of the time, I don’t send emails after 5:30.
