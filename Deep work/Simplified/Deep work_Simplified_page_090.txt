These two steps make sure I’m not forgetting anything urgent or important deadlines or meetings coming up. By now, I’ve looked over everything I need to do for work. To finish, I use this info to make a rough plan for the next day. Once the plan is done, I say, “Shutdown complete,” and stop thinking about work for the day.

The idea of a shutdown ritual might seem a bit much at first, but there’s a good reason for it: the Zeigarnik effect. This means unfinished tasks keep bothering our brain. If you just stop work at five p.m. and say, “I’m done,” you’ll probably still think about things you didn’t finish because your brain keeps focusing on them all evening.

At first, this sounds impossible to fix. Busy people always have tasks left undone. Thinking you can finish everything is unrealistic. Luckily, you don’t have to complete a task to stop thinking about it. Psychologist Roy Baumeister and E.J. Masicampo found that if you make a plan for how to finish an interrupted task, it helps your brain let go of it for a while. Their study showed that having a plan not only helps you finish the task later but also frees up your mind to focus on other things.

The shutdown ritual uses this idea to fight the Zeigarnik effect. It doesn’t make you plan every single task right then (that would be too much), but it does make you put all tasks in one list and look over them before planning the next day. This way, no task gets forgotten — you see them all every day and handle them when it’s time. Your brain doesn’t have to keep track of everything because the shutdown ritual takes care of it for you.
