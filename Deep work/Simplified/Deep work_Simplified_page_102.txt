It took me about twelve or so sessions before I started seeing real progress. You should expect something similar, so be patient. But I have two tips to help you get better faster.

Suggestion #1: Watch out for distractions and getting stuck in loops. When you’re new to meditation, your mind will try to distract you with random but interesting thoughts. For example, my mind would often start writing an email I needed to send. It sounds boring, but at that moment it felt super tempting.

When you notice your mind drifting away, gently tell yourself you can think about that later, then bring your focus back.

Distractions like this are a big problem when trying to meditate well. Another tricky problem is looping. When you face a hard problem, your brain tries to save energy by repeating what you already know instead of moving forward. For example, when working on a math proof, my mind would keep going over simple steps instead of trying the harder next steps. You need to watch out for looping because it can ruin your whole session. When you notice it, say to yourself you’re stuck in a loop, then move your focus to the next step.

Suggestion #2: Organize your deep thinking. “Thinking deeply” sounds easy, but it’s not. When you have no distractions, a tough problem, and time to think, it can be hard to know what to do next. I find it helps to have a plan for deep thinking. Start by carefully reviewing the important parts of the problem and keeping them in your mind. For example, if you’re planning a book chapter, these parts might be the main points you want to cover. If you’re solving a math proof, these could be the variables, assumptions, or smaller steps you need.
