Rule #3 Quit Social Media

In 2013, a writer and digital expert named Baratunde Thurston tried something new. He decided to take a break from the internet for twenty-five days. No Facebook, no Twitter, no Foursquare (a service where he was “Mayor of the Year” in 2011), and not even email. He really needed a rest. 

Thurston’s friends called him “the most connected man in the world.” In the year before his break, he joined over fifty-nine thousand Gmail chats and posted on Facebook fifteen hundred times. He said, “I was burnt out. Fried. Done. Toast.”

We know about this because he wrote about it in a magazine article called “#UnPlug.” He said it didn’t take long to get used to life without the internet. “After the first week, my days felt normal and calm,” he said. “I worried less about missing news, and I realized I still existed even if I didn’t post about it online.” He talked to strangers and enjoyed food without taking pictures for Instagram.

He even bought a bike and found it easier to ride when he wasn’t checking Twitter at the same time. “The break ended too fast,” he said.

But he had work to do and books to sell, so after the twenty-five days, he went back online.

Thurston’s experiment shows two big things about how we use social media and websites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Business Insider, and BuzzFeed. I’ll call all these “network tools” from now on.

First, we all realize these tools break up our time and make it hard to focus. This isn’t a new idea; everyone feels it. It’s a big problem, especially if you want to work deeply and concentrate. In the last rule, I gave tips to help you focus better. But these tips won’t work well if you keep living like Thurston did before his break—always distracted by apps and tabs on your screen.
