* Remember, an Internet sabbatical is different from the Internet Sabbath talked about in Rule #2.  

The Internet Sabbath means you take short breaks from the Internet regularly, like one day every weekend.  

An Internet sabbatical is a much longer break from being online. It can last for many weeks or even longer.
