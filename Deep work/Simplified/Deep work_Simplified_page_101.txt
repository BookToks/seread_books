After a quick lunch and shower at home, I usually took the subway across the river on my way back to campus. This saved me about a third of a mile of walking. Then, I would walk home after finishing work. So, I spent a lot of time on my feet during this time. This made me start a habit that I think you should try too: productive meditation.

Productive meditation means using time when your body is busy but your mind is free—like walking, jogging, driving, or showering—to focus on one clear work problem. Depending on your job, this might mean planning an article, writing a speech, solving a math problem, or improving a business plan. Like in mindfulness meditation, you have to keep bringing your mind back to the problem when it starts to wander or get stuck.

I used to do productive meditation on my daily trips across the river when I lived in Boston. As I got better at it, my results got better too. For example, I figured out chapter plans for much of my last book while walking, and I made progress on tough research problems.

I think you should try productive meditation too. You don’t have to do it every day, but aim for two or three times a week. It’s easy to find time because you can do it during things you’d normally just waste time on, like walking your dog or going to work. If you do it right, it can actually help you get more done instead of taking time away from work. You might even try scheduling a walk during your workday just to focus on your most important problem.

But I’m not just saying this because it helps you get work done (though it does). I’m more interested in how it can quickly improve your ability to think deeply. From my experience, productive meditation helps you resist distractions and focus better. By forcing you to keep returning your attention to one problem, it makes your brain stronger at ignoring distractions. And by pushing you to focus more and more on one problem, it improves your concentration.

To do productive meditation well, remember it takes practice, just like any kind of meditation. When I first tried it during the early weeks of my postdoc, I got really distracted and ended long sessions with little progress.
