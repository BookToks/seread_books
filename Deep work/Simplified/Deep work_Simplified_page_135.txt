To do this, you ask yourself a simple but surprising question: How many months would it take to train a smart recent college graduate with no special skills in my field to do this task?

Let’s try this question with some examples of unclear tasks.

• Example #1: Editing an academic paper well means you have to really understand the details of the work and the related research so you can check everything is right. This takes really advanced knowledge that usually takes years of study in graduate school. So, for this task, it might take about fifty to seventy-five months to train someone.

• Example #2: Making a PowerPoint about your company’s sales needs three things: knowing how to use PowerPoint, knowing the usual style for these presentations at your company, and knowing what sales numbers to include and how to turn them into charts. A smart college grad probably already knows PowerPoint and can learn the company style in a week. The hard part is learning the sales numbers and how to make good charts. This might take about a month of training, so two months total is a safe guess.

• Example #3: Meetings are hard to judge. They can be boring but also very important. This method helps you see through that. How long would it take to train a smart college grad to take your place in a planning meeting? They’d need to understand the project well, know the key steps, and understand who is involved and their skills. They’d also need to get how people actually work together and how the project really runs at your company.
