There are two ways to answer why some people succeed. The first looks closely at their personalities and strategies. The second focuses more on the kind of work they do, not just the people themselves.

Both answers matter, but the second one is more important here because it shows what today’s economy actually rewards.

To understand this, we look at two economists from MIT, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee. In their 2011 book, Race Against the Machine, they explain how digital technology is changing jobs in surprising ways. They say we are at the start of a “Great Restructuring.” Technology is moving fast, but many workers’ skills and companies can’t keep up. This is bad news for many workers. As machines get smarter, bosses are more likely to hire machines instead of people. When they do need people, new tech makes it easy to hire remote workers from anywhere, leaving local workers with fewer jobs.

But this isn’t all bad. Brynjolfsson and McAfee say the changes won’t cut all jobs but will split them. Some people will lose out because their skills can be done by machines or easily moved elsewhere. But others will do even better and get paid more. Another economist, Tyler Cowen, agrees with this idea of a split economy. What makes Brynjolfsson and McAfee’s work helpful is that they point out three groups of people who will do really well in this new machine age. The three successful people we’re talking about—Silver, Hansson, and Doerr—are in these groups. Let’s look at each group to see why they are now more valuable.

The first group, called “high-skilled” workers by Brynjolfsson and McAfee, includes people like Nate Silver.
