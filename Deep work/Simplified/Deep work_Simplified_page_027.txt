In one of the tests, she would stop people and tell them to move on to a new, harder task, like reading résumés and pretending to hire someone. In other tests, she let them finish the puzzles before giving them the next job. Between puzzles and hiring, she used a quick word game to measure how much their attention was still stuck on the first task. The results were clear: “People who have attention residue after switching tasks usually do worse on the next task,” and the more attention stuck, the worse they did.

The idea of attention residue helps explain why focusing hard on one thing works better, like how Grant gets a lot done. By working on one tough task for a long time without stopping, Grant avoids the negative effects of attention residue from other things, so he can do his best work on that one task.

When Grant works alone for days on a paper, he’s doing better than most professors who keep getting interrupted and distracted by other things.

Even if you can’t work alone like Grant (we’ll talk about other ways to plan deep work later), attention residue still shows that working while kind of distracted can really hurt how well you do. It might seem okay to check your email every ten minutes. Some people even say that’s better than always having your inbox open. But Leroy’s experiments show it’s not much better. Checking quickly adds another thing to focus on. Plus, when you see emails you can’t answer right away (which happens a lot), you have to go back to your main task with that new task still unfinished. This leftover attention from switching tasks lowers how well you perform.

Looking at all this, it’s clear: To do your best work, you need to spend long times fully focused on one thing without distractions. In other words, the best work comes from deep work. If you’re not used to focusing deeply for a long time, it will be hard to reach the top levels of quality and quantity needed to succeed.

Unless you’re way more talented than others, the people who do deep work will get more done than you.
