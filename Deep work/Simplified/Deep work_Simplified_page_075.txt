Don’t Work Alone The relationship between deep work and teamwork is complicated. It’s important to understand this because using teamwork the right way can make your focused work better in your job.

Let’s start by looking at a problem that seems impossible to solve. In Part 1 of this book, I talked about how Facebook designed its new headquarters. They made a huge open office space that can hold twenty-eight hundred workers. This kind of space makes it really hard to concentrate. Both common sense and research show that being around lots of coworkers all the time is very distracting and stops you from thinking deeply. In 2013, Bloomberg Businessweek even said we should stop using open-plan offices because of this.

But open offices aren’t just random. Maria Konnikova wrote in The New Yorker that the idea behind open offices was to help people talk and share ideas easily. This idea was popular with American companies that wanted a cool, start-up vibe. Josh Tyrangiel, the editor of Bloomberg Businessweek, said their open office helps everyone focus on the big goals and makes people curious about what others are doing. Jack Dorsey said Square’s open layout helps people learn new things by running into each other. Let’s call this idea—the chance meetings that lead to smart teamwork and new ideas—the theory of serendipitous creativity.

When Mark Zuckerberg built Facebook’s giant office, he probably believed in this idea, like many in Silicon Valley. Of course, things like saving money and keeping an eye on workers also mattered, but they’re less exciting. This choice—between helping people focus and helping them have creative meetings—makes it seem like deep work (working alone) and creative ideas (working with others) can’t happen together. But I think this is wrong. It’s based on not fully understanding the theory of serendipitous creativity.
