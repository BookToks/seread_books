This is a lesson I’ve learned again and again in my own career. I’ve focused on deep work for over ten years, but I’m still surprised by how powerful it is. When I was in grad school and first started practicing deep work, I was able to write two good research papers each year. I didn’t have to work late on weekdays or at all on weekends, which was pretty rare for students.

As I got closer to becoming a professor, I started to worry. As a student and postdoc, I had a lot of free time to organize my day how I wanted. I knew I would lose that when I became a professor, and I wasn’t sure I could fit enough deep work into a busier schedule to stay productive. Instead of just worrying, I made a plan to get better at deep work.

I worked on this plan during my last two years at MIT, while I was a postdoc looking for professor jobs. My main idea was to add limits to my schedule to copy the less free time I expected as a professor. Besides not working at night, I took long lunch breaks to run and then eat at my apartment. I also agreed to write my fourth book, So Good They Can’t Ignore You, which took a lot of my time.

To deal with these new limits, I got better at working deeply.

I started to block out deep work hours and protect them from interruptions. I also learned to think carefully during long walks I took each week, which helped my productivity. I became really focused on finding quiet places to work.

In the summer, I often worked under the dome in the Barker Engineering library—a big, nice place that gets crowded when classes start. In winter, I found quieter spots, like the small but nice Lewis Music Library. I even bought a $50 fancy notebook with a grid pattern to work on math proofs, thinking spending money on it would make me take my work more seriously.

I was surprised at how well this new focus on deep work helped me.

When I started as a computer science professor at Georgetown University in fall 2011, my responsibilities did get a lot bigger.
