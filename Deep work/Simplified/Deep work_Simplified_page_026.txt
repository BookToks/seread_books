This isn’t the first time I’ve seen this idea of how productivity works.

I first noticed it when I was researching my second book, How to Become a Straight-A Student, many years ago. I talked to about fifty top college students from some of the toughest schools. One thing I saw was that the very best students often studied less than the students just below them in grades. One reason for this was the formula I mentioned before: The best students knew how important focus is, so they worked hard to concentrate deeply. This helped them study or write papers faster without lowering their quality.

The example of Adam Grant shows that this focus trick isn’t just for college grades but also helps with other hard thinking tasks. But why is that? A good answer comes from Sophie Leroy, a business professor at the University of Minnesota. In a 2009 paper called “Why Is It So Hard to Do My Work?,” she talked about something she named attention residue.

At the start of her paper, she said other researchers looked at multitasking—doing many things at once—and how it affects work. But in today’s offices, especially for people in higher positions, it’s more common to work on several projects one after another. “Going from one meeting to the next, starting one project and soon switching to another is just part of life in organizations,” Leroy says.

The problem with this way of working is that when you switch from Task A to Task B, your attention doesn’t follow right away. Some of your focus stays stuck on the first task. This leftover attention is worse if you didn’t work hard or set limits on Task A before switching, but even if you finish Task A, your focus is still split for a while.

Leroy tested how this attention residue affects work by making people switch tasks in a lab. In one test, she had them start by doing word puzzles.
