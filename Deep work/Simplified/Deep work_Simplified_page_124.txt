If Bennett came back to life today, he’d probably feel really sad because people haven’t made much progress in this area of human growth.

To be honest, I don’t really care about the reasons behind Bennett’s ideas. His idea that reading poetry and great books can improve the middle class sounds old-fashioned and a bit snobby. But his main point—that you should and can use your free time wisely—is still important today. This is especially true when it comes to protecting your focus from distractions online.

So far, we haven’t talked much about a type of websites that are a big problem for staying focused: entertainment sites made to grab your attention and keep you hooked. Right now, popular examples are Huffington Post, BuzzFeed, Business Insider, and Reddit. This list will probably change, but all these sites have one thing in common: they use catchy titles and easy-to-read content, often chosen by smart algorithms to get your attention.

Once you click on one article, there are links all around the page asking you to click on more articles. These sites use every trick to keep you looking, like showing “popular” or “trending” tags and eye-catching pictures. For example, some popular BuzzFeed articles right now are “17 Words That Mean Something Totally Different When Spelled Backward” and “33 Dogs Winning at Everything.” These sites are especially bad after work when you have free time, because they can easily take over your leisure time. If you’re waiting in line, watching a slow TV show, or finishing a meal, these sites give you something to do so you don’t get bored. But like I said before, this is risky because it makes it harder for your brain to ignore distractions, which makes focusing deeply later much tougher. Even worse, you don’t have to sign up for these sites, so you can’t just quit them. They’re always there, just one click away.
