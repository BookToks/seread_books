J.K. Rowling uses a computer, but she stayed off social media while writing her Harry Potter books, even though social media was getting really popular then. Her team finally made a Twitter account for her in 2009 when she was working on The Casual Vacancy. For the first year and a half, she only tweeted once: “This is the real me, but you won’t hear from me often I’m afraid, as pen and paper is my priority at the moment.”

Deep work isn’t just for old-fashioned or tech-hating people. Microsoft’s CEO, Bill Gates, takes “Think Weeks” twice a year, where he stays away from everything, usually in a cottage, to just read and think. During one of these weeks in 1995, he wrote a memo that made Microsoft focus on the new internet company Netscape.

Neal Stephenson, a famous cyberpunk writer who helped shape how we see the internet, is really hard to reach online. His website doesn’t have an email and explains why he’s bad at using social media on purpose. He said if he gets long, uninterrupted time, he can write novels. But if he gets interrupted a lot, he just ends up sending lots of emails instead of creating something lasting.

Many important people do deep work, which is very different from what most modern knowledge workers do today. 

The reason many knowledge workers don’t do deep work anymore is clear: network tools. This means things like email, texting, social media sites like Twitter and Facebook, and entertainment sites like BuzzFeed and Reddit. Because of smartphones and computers connected to the internet, workers’ attention is split into tiny pieces. A 2012 study showed that the average knowledge worker spends over 60% of their workweek on electronic communication and internet searching, with almost 30% of their time just reading and answering emails.

This kind of broken attention doesn’t allow for deep work, which needs long, uninterrupted time to think. But even with this problem, modern knowledge workers are still working hard.
