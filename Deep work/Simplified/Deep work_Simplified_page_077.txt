Kelly didn’t like the usual way universities put different departments in separate buildings. Instead, she connected all the spaces into one big building with long hallways—some so long that when you stood at one end, it looked like the hallway disappeared in the distance. Jon Gertner, who wrote about Bell Labs, said that walking down these hallways without running into friends, problems, or new ideas was almost impossible. A physicist going to lunch was like a magnet attracting iron filings. This setup, along with Kelly hiring some of the smartest people in the world, helped create tons of important inventions. After World War II, the lab made the first solar cell, laser, communication satellite, cell phone system, and fiber optic networks. Their scientists also created information theory and coding theory, their astronomers won a Nobel Prize for proving the Big Bang Theory, and their physicists invented the transistor.

The idea that creativity can come from chance meetings seems true based on history. We can say with some confidence that the transistor probably needed Bell Labs. It put solid-state physicists, quantum theorists, and top experimenters all in one building so they could run into each other and learn from different fields. This invention probably wouldn’t have happened if one scientist had worked alone in a quiet tower like Carl Jung’s stone tower.

But we need to think more carefully about what really made places like Building 20 and Bell Labs creative. Let me explain using my own experience at MIT. When I started as a new PhD student in fall 2004, I was in the first class to move into the new Stata Center, which replaced Building 20. Since the building was new, we got tours that showed off its design. Frank Gehry, the architect, arranged offices around shared spaces and added open staircases between floors to encourage chance meetings like before. But what surprised me was something Gehry hadn’t planned but was added because the professors wanted it: special seals on office doors to block sound. The professors at MIT—some of the most creative tech experts in the world—didn’t want open offices. They wanted to be able to close their doors and have quiet spaces.
