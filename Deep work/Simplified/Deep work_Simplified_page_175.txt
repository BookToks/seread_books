Lexical decision games show a bunch of letters on the screen. Some of these letters make real words, and some do not.

The player has to quickly decide if the word is real or fake. They press one key for “real” and another key for “not real.”

These games help measure how much certain words are “active” in the player’s mind. When a word is more active, the player presses the “real word” key faster when they see it.
