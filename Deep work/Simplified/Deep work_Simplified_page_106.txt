Move carefully through each room, linking the right mental pictures with objects in the right order. After finishing a room, you might want to walk through it a few times to really remember the images. When you’re done, you can give the deck to a friend and impress them by naming all the cards in order without looking. To do this, just go through your mental walkthrough again, connecting each person or thing you remembered to its matching card as you focus on it.

If you practice this method, you’ll find, like many memory experts before you, that you can learn a whole deck in just a few minutes. More important than showing off to friends is how this practice trains your brain. Going through these steps means you have to focus your attention over and over on one clear goal. Like exercising a muscle, this will make your ability to concentrate stronger and help you focus more easily.

It’s important to remember that card memorization isn’t special. Any focused thinking that needs steady attention can do the same thing—like studying the Talmud, practicing meditation, or learning a guitar part by ear (something I liked to do). So if card memorization feels weird to you, pick something else that challenges your brain in the same way. The main idea is not what you do, but that your focus gets better the more you practice it.
