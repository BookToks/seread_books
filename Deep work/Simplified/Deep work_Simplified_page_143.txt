On their author websites, many writers put their email address and invite people to send them any requests or ideas. They even say this feedback is important for building a “community” with their readers.

But here’s the thing: I don’t really believe that.

If you check my author website’s contact page, you won’t find a general email address. Instead, I list different people to contact for specific reasons, like my literary agent for rights requests or my speaking agent for speaking requests. If you want to reach me, I give a special email address, but with rules and a low chance I’ll reply: If you have an offer, chance, or introduction that might make my life more interesting, email me at interesting [at] calnewport.com. I only reply if it fits my schedule and interests.

I call this a sender filter because I’m asking people to decide if their message is worth sending before they contact me. This filter has helped me spend less time on emails. Before, I had a regular email address on my site. I used to get lots of long emails asking for advice about school or careers. I like helping people, but these took a lot of time to answer. My sender filter stopped most of these emails, so now I get way fewer messages in my inbox. Instead of answering every question, I focus on working with a few student groups where I can really help.

Another good thing about a sender filter is it changes what people expect. The key sentence I use is: “I’ll only respond to those proposals that are a good match for my schedule and interests.” This might seem small, but it changes how people think about their emails to me. Usually, people think if they email someone, that person has to reply. So, many emails mean feeling like you owe lots of answers.

By telling people I probably won’t reply, it changes the whole experience.
