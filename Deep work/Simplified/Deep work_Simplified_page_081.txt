Discipline #1: Focus on the Wildly Important  
The authors of The 4 Disciplines of Execution say, “The more you try to do, the less you actually get done.” They explain that you should focus on just a few really important goals. This makes it easier to put all your energy into them and get real results.  

If you want to do deep work, you should pick a small number of big goals to work on during those focused hours. Just telling yourself to “work more deeply” isn’t very exciting. But having a clear goal that will bring real benefits makes it easier to stay motivated. In a 2014 article called “The Art of Focus,” David Brooks said that instead of trying to ignore small distractions, you should say “yes” to a goal that really matters to you and let that goal take over your attention. For example, when I started using 4DX, I set a goal to publish five good research papers in one academic year. This was hard because it was more than I had done before, and it mattered because I was up for tenure. Having a big goal like that helped keep me motivated.  

Discipline #2: Act on the Lead Measures  
After you pick your important goal, you need to figure out how to measure your progress. In 4DX, there are two types of measurements: lag measures and lead measures.  

Lag measures show the result you want to improve. For example, if your goal is to make customers happier at your bakery, then the lag measure is the customer happiness scores. The problem is lag measures come too late to help you change what you do because they show what already happened. Lead measures, on the other hand, track the actions you can take now that will help improve the lag measures later. In the bakery example, a good lead measure could be how many customers get free samples. You can control this by giving out more samples. If you do that, your customer happiness scores will probably get better over time. Lead measures help you focus on what you can do right now that will lead to success later.
