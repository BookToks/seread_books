If you want to focus on deep work, it’s easy to figure out what to track: the time you spend working deeply on your most important goal. For example, this idea really helped me with my school research. Before, I only looked at how many papers I published each year. But that didn’t help me day to day because I couldn’t do anything right away that would change that long-term goal.

When I started tracking the hours I spent in deep work, it made a big difference. Every extra hour I worked deeply showed up right away on my record.

Discipline #3: Keep a Scoreboard

The 4DX authors say, “People play differently when they’re keeping score.” They explain that if you want your team to work toward a big goal, it’s important to have a public scoreboard for tracking progress. This makes it feel like a game and helps people focus, even when other things try to distract them. It also motivates them to keep doing well because they see their progress.

Since deep work hours are the key measure for an individual, the person should have a scoreboard they can see in their workspace that shows how many hours they’ve done.

When I first tried 4DX, I made a simple scoreboard. I took a piece of card stock and split it into rows for each week of the semester. I wrote the dates on each row and taped it to the wall next to my computer, so I couldn’t ignore it. Each week, I marked how many hours I spent in deep work with tick marks in that week’s row. When I hit a big milestone in a paper, like solving an important problem, I circled the tick mark for the hour I finished it.

This helped me in two ways.

First, it made me really connect the hours I worked deeply with actual results.
