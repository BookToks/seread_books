Because you’re ready to change your plan when a new, cool idea comes up, you’re just as good as someone who gets easily distracted but creative at following through when inspiration hits.

To sum it up, this strategy is about realizing that to do really focused work, you need to respect your time. A good first step is to plan in advance what you’re going to do every minute of your workday. At first, it might feel weird or annoying because it’s easier to just go with whatever comes up or what others ask you to do. But you have to get past this dislike of having a schedule if you want to reach your full potential and make things that really matter.

By planning your day, you can see how much time you spend on easy, low-value tasks. But figuring this out can be tricky because it’s not always clear what counts as “shallow” work. Remember, shallow work means tasks that don’t need much thinking, like simple, routine stuff you can do while distracted. These tasks usually don’t create much new value and are easy to copy.

Some tasks are obviously shallow, like checking emails or setting up a conference call. But other tasks are harder to label. For example:  
- Editing a draft with a teammate for a journal article.  
- Making a PowerPoint about sales this quarter.  
- Going to a meeting to talk about an important project and decide what to do next.

It’s not obvious whether these are shallow or deep work. The first two can be pretty demanding, and the last one seems important for moving a project forward. The goal of this strategy is to help you figure out exactly where tasks like these fit on the shallow-to-deep scale so you can make clear and consistent choices.
