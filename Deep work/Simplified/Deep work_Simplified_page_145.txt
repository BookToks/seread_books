Herbert uses filters to help him deal with messages and find cool chances, but these filters also cut down on how many messages he gets so he can handle them easily.

For example, Antonio Centeno runs a popular blog called Real Man Style. He has a two-step filter for messages. First, if you have a question, he asks you to post it somewhere public. He thinks it’s a waste of time to answer the same questions over and over in private chats. If you pass this step, you have to agree to three promises by clicking check boxes: You won’t ask a style question you could find on Google in 10 minutes. You won’t send spam or try to promote your business. And if Antonio replies within 23 hours, you will do a nice thing for a random stranger.

You can only type your message after agreeing to all three promises.

In short, email technology is powerful, but the social rules for using it aren’t well developed yet.

Expecting every message, no matter who it’s from or what it’s about, to arrive in the same inbox and get a quick reply is not helpful. Sender filters are a small but useful way to improve this, especially for people like entrepreneurs and freelancers who get lots of messages and can control who contacts them. It would be great if similar rules existed inside big companies, but that might take a while. If you can, try using sender filters to take back control of your time and focus.

Tip #2: Do More Work When You Send or Reply to Emails. Here’s an example: Email #1: “It was great to meet you last week. I’d love to follow up on some of the things we talked about.”
