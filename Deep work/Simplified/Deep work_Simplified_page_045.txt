As he looks at the hot blade, something clicks in his mind: “It’s ready.” He picks up the red-hot sword carefully, holding it away from his body, and quickly walks to a pipe full of oil. Then, he dips the blade into the oil to cool it down. After a moment of relief that the blade didn’t break—a common problem here—Furrer pulls it out. The heat from the sword lights the fuel on fire, making the whole sword glow with yellow flames. Furrer raises the burning sword above his head with one strong arm and looks at it for a moment before blowing out the fire.

During this short break, the flames light up his face, showing how much he loves what he’s doing.

“To do it right, this is the hardest thing I know how to make,” Furrer says. “I don’t need a sword. But I have to make them.” Ric Furrer is a master craftsman who spends most of his day deeply focused—because even a small mistake can ruin many hours of work.

He also clearly finds a lot of meaning in his job. This link between hard work and a happy life is well-known when we talk about craftsmen. “The joy of creating something real with your hands can make a person calm and happy,” explains Matthew Crawford. And we believe him.

But when we think about office or knowledge work, this connection isn’t as clear.

One problem is that office work isn’t always clear. Craftsmen like Furrer face tasks that are easy to understand but hard to do—a good mix for feeling purpose. Office jobs don’t have this clarity. It’s often hard to say what exactly someone does or how they’re different from others. On bad days, all office work can feel like endless emails and boring PowerPoint slides, with only the charts changing from job to job. Furrer feels this dullness too when he says, “The world of information superhighways and cyber space has left me rather cold and disenchanted.” Another problem is that office workers are told to spend more time on shallow tasks. As we saw before, today anything online is seen as cool and important. Quick email replies and active social media are praised, while ignoring these things makes people suspicious.
