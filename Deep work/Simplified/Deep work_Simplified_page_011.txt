The need for deep work is something new. In the old industrial economy, only a small group of skilled workers really needed to focus deeply, while most people did okay without learning how to concentrate without distractions. They were paid to do simple tasks that didn’t change much over time. But now, as we move to an information economy, more people work with knowledge, and deep work is becoming super important—even if most don’t realize it yet.

Deep work isn’t an old skill that’s no longer useful.

It’s actually a very important skill for anyone who wants to succeed in today’s competitive world, where people who don’t work hard and focus can easily be left behind. The big rewards go to those who can create new and complex things, not just those who use easy, common tools like Facebook. Deep work is so valuable that some call it “the superpower of the 21st century.” We see two main ideas: deep work is becoming harder to find, but also more valuable. This leads to the Deep Work Hypothesis: being able to focus deeply is getting rarer and more important at the same time. So, people who learn this skill and make it a big part of their work will do really well.

This book has two main goals. The first part will convince you that the Deep Work Hypothesis is true. The second part will teach you how to train your brain and change your work habits to make deep work a key part of your life. But before that, I want to share how I came to care so much about deep work.

For the last ten years, I have worked on improving my ability to focus on difficult tasks. To explain why, you should know I’m a computer scientist who studied at MIT in a special group where being able to concentrate is super important.
