Having offices that block out noise and are connected to big shared spaces creates a setup where people can bump into each other by chance or work alone without distractions. This setup balances two kinds of work: one where a person thinks alone without interruptions but might miss new ideas, and one where people work together openly and get inspired but find it hard to focus deeply.

If we look at places like Building 20 and Bell Labs, they used this kind of setup too. They didn’t have modern open offices. Instead, they had private offices connected by shared hallways. These hallways made people meet and talk when moving between offices.

These big hallways acted like important meeting spots.

So, we can still say open offices, which can break focus, aren’t great without giving up the idea that surprising meetings help creativity. The trick is to have a mix: spend time in shared spaces to get new ideas but also have quiet spots to focus on those ideas deeply.

But it’s not just about working alone after meeting others. For example, the invention of the transistor at Bell Labs happened because many experts worked together first. They formed a special group to invent a smaller, better part than the vacuum tube. Their teamwork and talks were needed to start the process.

After the group figured out the big ideas, the work moved to a quieter place. What’s cool is that even then, two researchers—Walter Brattain and John Bardeen—worked closely together in a small lab for a month. They pushed each other to create the first working transistor.

Brattain and Bardeen worked side by side, helping each other come up with better designs.
