Here’s another example: people often set up regular meetings for projects. These meetings can add up and mess up your schedule so much that it’s hard to focus all day. Why do these meetings keep happening? Because they’re easier. For many, having these regular meetings is a simple way to stay organized. Instead of managing their time and tasks on their own, they let the weekly meeting push them to do something on the project and show some visible progress.

Think about a common annoying habit: forwarding an email to coworkers with a short question like “Thoughts?” These emails take just a few seconds to send but can take the receivers many minutes or even hours to answer properly. If the sender put a little more effort into writing the email, everyone could save a lot of time. So why do these time-wasting emails happen so often? Because they’re easier for the sender. It’s a quick way to clear their inbox without much effort.

The Principle of Least Resistance, hidden by confusing metrics, supports work cultures that avoid the hard parts like focusing and planning. This might feel easier in the short term but hurts long-term satisfaction and real success. This principle pushes us toward shallow work in a world that actually values deep work more and more. But this isn’t the only problem caused by confusing metrics. We also have to think about the constant pressure to be “productive,” which we’ll talk about next.

Being busy instead of actually productive is a big issue. Professors at research universities have a clear way to measure their success: Are they publishing important papers? This can even be turned into a single number called the h-index, created by Jorge Hirsch, which shows how much impact their work has based on their publications and how often other people cite them.
