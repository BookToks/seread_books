As Nietzsche said, “Only ideas gained from walking are really valuable.” Support for your work can also mean setting up your environment to reduce distractions and save energy, like organizing your materials well (like Caro did). To do your best deep work, you need help and a plan so you don’t waste brainpower figuring out what to do next.

These questions will help you start making your own deep work routine. But remember, finding one that works might take some trial and error, so be patient. It’s worth it because once you find a routine that fits, it can really make a difference. Deep work is serious and shouldn’t be done lightly. Having a detailed, maybe even weird, routine shows you’re serious and helps your brain focus so you can create important things.

Make Big Moves Sometimes, you need to do something dramatic to get into the right mindset. In early winter 2007, J.K. Rowling was trying to finish The Deathly Hallows, the last Harry Potter book. The pressure was huge because it had to wrap up the whole series for millions of fans. But she couldn’t focus at home in Edinburgh with distractions like the window cleaner, kids, and barking dogs.

So, Rowling did something bold: she checked into a fancy hotel called the Balmoral in downtown Edinburgh. She didn’t plan to stay long, but the first day went so well she kept coming back. Eventually, she finished the book there. It makes sense—the Balmoral is a beautiful, old hotel with fancy stonework and a big clock tower, perfect for her to focus and get her work done.
