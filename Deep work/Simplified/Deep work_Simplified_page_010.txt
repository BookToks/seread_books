“Some people come unprepared,” he said. “They can’t focus. They can’t learn fast.” Only half the students who started the program with Benn finished on time. But Benn not only graduated, he was the best student in his class.

The hard work paid off. Benn quickly got a job as a developer at a San Francisco tech start-up with $25 million in funding and many job choices.

When Benn quit his financial consultant job six months earlier, he was making $40,000 a year. His new job as a computer developer paid $100,000—a salary that can keep growing with his skills in Silicon Valley.

When I last talked to Benn, he was doing great at his new job. He became a big fan of deep work and rented an apartment near his office so he could start early before anyone else and work without distractions. “On good days, I get four hours of focus before the first meeting,” he said. “Then maybe another three or four hours in the afternoon. And I mean real focus: no email, no Hacker News, just programming.” For someone who used to spend almost all day at his old job surfing the web, Benn’s change is amazing.

Jason Benn’s story shows an important lesson: Deep work isn’t just something old writers or thinkers cared about. It’s a skill that’s really important today.

There are two main reasons why it matters. First, it helps you learn. We live in a world full of complicated things that change fast. Some of the computer languages Benn learned didn’t exist ten years ago and might be outdated in ten years. Like marketing experts in the 1990s who didn’t know they’d need to learn digital analytics today, you have to learn new things fast to stay valuable. Deep work helps with that. Without it, you’ll fall behind as technology moves forward.

The second reason deep work is important is because the internet works both ways. If you make something good, lots of people can find it, which means you can get great rewards. But if what you make is bad, people can easily find something better online.

Whether you’re a programmer, writer, marketer, consultant, or business owner, your situation is like Jung trying to outsmart Freud or Benn trying to succeed at a hot start-up. To win, you have to make the best stuff you can—and that takes deep work.
