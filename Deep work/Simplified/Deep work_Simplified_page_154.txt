As this year went on, I became really good at focusing deeply—and the results surprised me. In the same year that I wrote a book and my oldest son went through the terrible twos, I managed to more than double how much academic work I did, publishing nine research papers—all while still not working in the evenings.

I admit that my year of intense focus was maybe a little too much: it was mentally tiring, and in the future, I’ll probably take it a bit easier.

But this experience shows the main point I started with: deep work is way more powerful than most people realize. It’s this kind of focus that let Bill Gates take advantage of a chance to create a new industry, and it helped me double my academic output while writing a book at the same time. I believe leaving behind distractions and joining the focused few can really change your life.

Living a deep life isn’t for everyone. It takes hard work and big changes to your habits. Many people feel comfortable staying busy with quick emails and social media, but deep work means giving up a lot of that. It can also be scary to try your hardest because it means facing the fact that your best might not be great yet. It’s easier to just comment on what’s going on around us than to actually try to make things better.

But if you’re willing to leave those comforts and fears behind, and work hard to use your mind fully to create important things, you’ll find—like many others have—that deep work leads to a life full of meaning and productivity. In Part 1, I shared a quote from writer Winifred Gallagher who said, “I’ll live the focused life, because it’s the best kind there is.” I agree. So does Bill Gates. And now that you’ve finished this book, I hope you agree too.
