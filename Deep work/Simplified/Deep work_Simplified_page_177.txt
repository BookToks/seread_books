I’m using the word “individualized” a bit loosely here. The monastic way of thinking doesn’t only apply to people who work alone.  

There are times when deep work happens in small groups. For example, think about songwriting teams like Rodgers and Hammerstein, or invention teams like the Wright brothers.  

What I really mean is that this idea works best for people who can focus on clear goals without having other responsibilities that come from being part of a big group.
