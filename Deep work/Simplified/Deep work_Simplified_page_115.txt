Some goals are too specific, like “finish paper on broadcast lower bounds in time for upcoming conference submission,” because they only happen once. A better goal would be something like: “regularly read and understand the latest results in my field.” 

The next step is to think about the tools you use, like apps or websites. For each tool, ask if it helps you a lot, hurts you a lot, or doesn’t really affect you when doing your important activities. Then decide: only keep using the tool if it helps you more than it hurts you.

Let’s look at an example. Imagine Michael Lewis has this goal for his writing career: 

Professional Goal: To write well-told stories that change how people see the world.

Important Activities for This Goal:  
• Research carefully and patiently.  
• Write carefully and with purpose.

Now, think about whether Twitter helps Michael with these activities. It’s hard to say Twitter makes him better at either one. Research for Michael means spending weeks or months talking to a few people and learning deeply. Writing carefully needs focus without distractions. Twitter probably doesn’t help, and might even hurt if he gets distracted by it. So, the conclusion is that Michael shouldn’t use Twitter.

You might say this example is too narrow because it ignores other ways Twitter could help. For writers, Twitter is often seen as a way to connect with readers and sell more books. But for Michael Lewis, marketing isn’t an important enough goal to change his decision.
