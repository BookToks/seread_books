A PhD student named Brian Chappell is a dad with a full-time job. He really values deep work because it’s the only way he can make progress on his big research project with the little time he has. Chappell said his first time hearing about deep work was “an emotional moment.” 

I share these examples because even though Knuth and Chappell both think deep work is important, they have different ways of fitting it into their lives. Knuth uses a strict approach, almost like living like a monk, where he tries to cut out all other kinds of work to focus deeply. Chappell, on the other hand, has a routine where he works early every weekday morning from five to seven thirty, no matter what, before starting a normal workday with normal distractions. Both ways can work, but not for everyone. Knuth’s way might be good if your main job is to think deeply, but if Chappell tried to avoid all shallow work like that, he might lose his job.

You need to find your own way to fit deep work into your life. Trying to do deep work randomly doesn’t work well because your willpower is limited. This example shows that you have to pick a way that fits your situation, or else your habit of deep work might fail before it starts. To help, I’ll share four different deep work styles that have worked well for others. The point is to show you there are many ways to include deep work in your schedule, so it’s worth finding the one that works best for you.

Now, let’s talk about Donald Knuth again. He’s famous in computer science for many things, like creating a strict way to study how fast algorithms work. But he’s also well-known among his friends for how he handles email. If you go to Knuth’s website at Stanford looking for his email, you’ll see a note that says: “I have been a happy man ever since January 1, 1990, when I no longer had an email address. I’d used email since about 1975, and it seems to me that 15 years of email is plenty for one lifetime.”
