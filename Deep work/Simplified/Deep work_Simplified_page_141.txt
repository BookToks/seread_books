For example, if someone asks me to speak at an event that will take a lot of my time, I don’t give a lot of details when I say no. I just say, “Sounds interesting, but I can’t make it because of other plans.” I don’t leave room for them to try to fit their event into my schedule. When I say no to something, I also avoid offering a smaller favor that still takes up a lot of my time, like saying, “Sorry I can’t join your group, but I can look at your ideas and give feedback.” It’s better to make a clean break.

Besides protecting my commitments, I’m very careful about managing my time. Since I only have so many hours each day, I can’t let big deadlines sneak up on me or waste a morning on something unimportant because I didn’t plan well. Having a fixed schedule with clear work hours helps me stay organized and focused. Without a set time to stop working, I’d probably get less strict with my habits.

To sum up, Nagpal and I can do well in academics without being overloaded like Tom, for two reasons. First, we cut out the shallow stuff but keep the important work. This frees up time without lowering the value of what we do. In fact, cutting shallow tasks gives us more energy to focus on important work, so we get more done than if we had a busy, crowded schedule. Second, because our time is limited, we think more carefully about how we organize our work, which helps us be more productive compared to working longer but less organized hours.

The main idea is that this strategy works for most jobs that involve thinking and knowledge, not just professors. Even if you’re not in school, having a fixed schedule can help a lot. It’s often hard to say no to small requests like a coffee meeting or a quick call because they seem harmless. But with a fixed-schedule mindset, you start to see your time as limited. Any task that isn’t really important feels like it might get in the way. So, you say no more often, and only say yes to things that really matter. You also get better at organizing your work. This can even make you question your company’s work culture. For example, you might notice that your boss emails you after work hours more often than you thought was normal.
