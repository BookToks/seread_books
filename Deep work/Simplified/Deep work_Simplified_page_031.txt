Chapter Two: Deep Work Is Rare

In 2012, Facebook shared plans for a new office designed by Frank Gehry. At the center of the building is what CEO Mark Zuckerberg called “the largest open floor plan in the world.” More than three thousand workers will use movable furniture spread out over a huge area.

Facebook isn’t the only big tech company trying open offices. When Jack Dorsey bought an old building for his company Square, he set it up so his developers work together at long shared desks. Dorsey said they like people working in open spaces because it helps them run into each other and learn new things by chance.

Another big trend lately is instant messaging. A Times article says this tech isn’t just for teenagers anymore—it helps companies work faster and respond to customers better. A manager at IBM said they send 2.5 million instant messages every day. One new app, Hall, helps workers not just chat but actually work together in real time. A developer I know said the best workers use Hall efficiently: they set alerts for new messages and quickly reply without stopping their coding. He was impressed by how fast they worked.

A third trend is that content creators now need to be active on social media. Even the New York Times, known for old-style journalism, tells its staff to tweet. Over eight hundred writers, editors, and photographers at the paper now have Twitter accounts.
