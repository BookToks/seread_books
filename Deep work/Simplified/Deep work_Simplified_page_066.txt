During this time, a writer and comedian named Brad Isaac, who was doing open mic nights, met Seinfeld at a club while waiting to go on stage. Isaac later said in a popular Lifehacker article, “I saw my chance. I had to ask Seinfeld if he had any tips for a young comic. What he told me helped me for life.” Seinfeld started with simple advice, saying “the way to be a better comic is to create better jokes,” and explained that to do that, you need to write every day. He then shared a trick he uses to keep himself on track. He keeps a calendar on his wall.

Every day he writes jokes, he crosses out the date on the calendar with a big red X.

“After a few days you’ll have a chain,” Seinfeld said. “Just keep going and the chain will get longer every day. You’ll like seeing that chain, especially after a few weeks. Your only job is to not break the chain.” This chain method became popular with writers and people who work out regularly—groups that need to do hard things consistently. For us, it shows a way to add focus to your life, called the rhythmic philosophy. This idea says the easiest way to start deep work sessions regularly is to turn them into a simple habit. The goal is to create a rhythm that stops you from having to think about if or when you’ll do deep work. The chain method is a great example of this because it mixes a simple rule (work every day) with a clear reminder: the big red Xs on the calendar.

Another way to use the rhythmic philosophy is to pick a set time every day for deep work instead of using the calendar trick.

Just like seeing your progress helps you start working deeply, removing even small decisions, like when to work, makes it easier to get started.

Take Brian Chappell, a busy PhD student I mentioned earlier. He used the rhythmic philosophy because he had to. When he was starting to write his dissertation, he got a full-time job at a center on campus. It was a good chance for him, and he was happy to take it. But having a full-time job and a new baby made it hard to find the focus he needed to write his thesis chapters.
