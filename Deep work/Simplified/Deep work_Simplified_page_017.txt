Robots and voice recognition are taking over many simple jobs. But some economists say that other technologies like showing data in pictures, analyzing information, fast internet, and quick making of new products are helping people who work with data and thinking skills. This means people who can work well with smart machines will do great. Tyler Cowen puts it simply: “The big question is, can you work well with smart machines or not?” Nate Silver, who is good at putting data into big systems and using it in special simulations, is a perfect example of a skilled worker. Smart machines don’t stop Silver; they actually help him succeed.

There are also “superstars,” like top programmer David Heinemeier Hansson, who will do really well in the new economy that Brynjolfsson and McAfee talk about. Because of fast internet and tools like email and video calls, it doesn’t matter where you live anymore. Instead of hiring a full-time programmer with an office and benefits, companies can pay a world-class programmer like Hansson just for the time needed to finish a project. This usually costs less and gets better results. Hansson can also work for many clients, making more money.

It doesn’t matter if Hansson works from Marbella, Spain, while your office is in Des Moines, Iowa. New communication tools make working together easy. But this is bad news for less-skilled programmers in Des Moines who need steady jobs. This idea also applies to other jobs where technology lets people work from anywhere, like consulting, marketing, writing, and design. When the talent pool is global, the best people win, and others lose out.

In 1981, economist Sherwin Rosen studied these “winner-take-all” markets. He showed that talent—called q in his math—is not something you can just add up. Rosen said, “Listening to many average singers doesn’t equal one amazing performance.” This means you can’t just combine average people to get the best result. Being the very best is worth a lot more.
