Dewane is an architecture teacher who likes to mix ideas with real things. The Eudaimonia Machine is a good example of this. The machine is named after an old Greek idea called eudaimonia, which means being your best self. It’s actually a building. “The goal of the machine,” David said, “is to help people do their best work and reach their full potential.” It’s a place made just for focusing really well. I was, as you can guess, very interested.

Dewane showed me the machine by drawing it with a pen. It’s a one-floor, long and narrow building with five rooms lined up one after another. There’s no hallway; you have to go through each room to get to the next one. Dewane said this is important because you can’t skip any rooms as you go deeper inside.

The first room is called the gallery. It would show examples of great work done in the building. This is to inspire people and create a kind of healthy pressure from others. After the gallery, you enter the salon. Here, Dewane wants there to be good coffee and maybe even a bar. There are couches and Wi-Fi too.

The salon is meant to feel like a place between curious thinking and arguing. It’s where you can talk, think deeply, and work through ideas before moving on.

Next, you enter the library. This room keeps all the work done in the building, plus books and resources used before. There will be copiers and scanners to help you collect information for your project.
