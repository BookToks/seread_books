Before I let you try this strategy yourself, I want to talk about a common worry. When I explain the benefits of daily schedules, many people say that planning too much feels too controlling and stressful.

For example, a reader named Joseph commented on my blog: He thinks I don’t talk enough about how life is unpredictable. He worries that some readers might take scheduling too seriously and become obsessed with tracking every minute. He says this can stop people, especially artists, from just getting lost in their creative work, which is often the best thing to do.

I get where Joseph is coming from, and he’s not the only one who feels this way.

But the good news is that this worry can be easily fixed. In my own daily schedule, I always save big chunks of time for thinking freely and talking things over. I also have a rule: if I discover something important during the day, it’s okay to ignore the rest of my schedule (except for things I can’t skip). I focus on that new idea until it runs out of steam, then I make a new plan for the rest of the day.

So, I don’t just allow surprises in my schedule—I actually welcome them.

Joseph thinks a schedule means you have to follow a strict plan no matter what. But that’s wrong. Scheduling like this is about being thoughtful. It’s a habit that makes you stop and ask yourself during the day, “What should I do next with the time I have?” It’s the asking that helps, not blindly sticking to the plan.

I even think that if you schedule carefully but stay open to changing your plan, you might come up with more creative ideas than if you just leave your day wide open with no structure.

Without any plan, it’s easy to waste time on shallow stuff like emails, social media, or random web surfing. That feels good for a bit but doesn’t help you be creative. With a schedule, you can set aside time to work on new ideas, focus deeply on a challenge, or brainstorm for a set time. This kind of focus is more likely to spark creativity. Remember how many great creative people stick to strict routines?
