For many jobs, these time-wasters can leave you with very little time to focus on your own work.

My job as a professor usually has fewer distractions like this, but even then, they still take up a lot of my time, especially during the school year. For example, looking at a random day from last semester (I’m writing this during a quiet summer), I had a meeting from eleven to twelve, another from one to two thirty, and a class to teach from three to five. That means half of my eight-hour workday was already taken. Even if I did all the quick tasks like emails in one half-hour, I still wouldn’t reach my goal of four hours of deep, focused work. In other words, even though we can’t spend a whole day fully focused, this shouldn’t stop us from cutting down on shallow work because the typical workday breaks up more easily than most people think.

To sum up, I want you to be careful with shallow work because it often causes more harm than we realize, and people think it’s more important than it really is. You can’t avoid it completely, but you need to keep it limited so it doesn’t stop you from doing the deep work that really makes a difference. The tips that come next will help you handle this.

Schedule Every Minute of Your Day If you’re between twenty-five and thirty-four years old and live in Britain, you probably watch more TV than you think. In 2013, a British group asked people about their TV watching habits. The people in that age group said they watch about fifteen to sixteen hours a week. That sounds like a lot, but it’s actually way less than the real amount. We know this because a group called the Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board (kind of like the Nielsen Company in the US) puts meters in some homes to track TV watching without anyone lying or guessing. It turns out, those same people actually watch about twenty-eight hours a week.

This kind of wrong guess about how we spend time isn’t just about British TV. When other groups estimate how they spend their time, there are often big differences between what they say and what actually happens.
