Honestly, that year was really tiring, especially because I was writing this book at the same time. But it also showed that the 4DX method works: by summer 2014, I had nine full papers accepted for publication, more than twice as many as I had in any previous year.

In a 2012 New York Times blog post, writer and cartoonist Tim Kreider described himself in a funny way: “I am not busy. I am the laziest ambitious person I know.” But before he wrote that, he was super busy because of work. He said, “Every morning my inbox was full of emails asking me to do things I didn’t want to do or problems I had to solve.” 

To fix this, Kreider escaped to a secret place with no TV and no internet (he had to bike to the library to go online). There, he ignored small annoying tasks that, one by one, added up and ruined his focus. He said, “I remembered things like buttercups, stink bugs, and stars. I read. And finally, I was able to do real writing again after months.”

It’s important to know that Kreider isn’t some philosopher like Thoreau. He didn’t hide away to make a big point about society. Instead, he did it because he found something practical: it made him better at his job. Kreider explained that being idle isn’t just a break or a bad habit; it’s as important for your brain as vitamin D is for your body. Without it, your mind gets messed up. Surprisingly, taking breaks is actually needed to get real work done.

When Kreider talks about work, he doesn’t mean easy tasks. Usually, spending more time on easy work means you get more done. But as a writer and artist, Kreider cares about deep work—the serious kind that creates valuable things.

He believes that doing this kind of work needs a mind that gets regular time to relax and do nothing.
