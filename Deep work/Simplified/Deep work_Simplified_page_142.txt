Fixed-schedule productivity means you don’t check or answer messages until the next morning. Many people think this would cause problems because others expect quick replies. But often, just because your boss is checking emails at night doesn’t mean she wants you to answer right away. This method helps you understand that.

If you’re still unsure about how setting limits on your work hours can help you succeed, look at Radhika Nagpal’s career. Around the same time Tom was complaining online about his busy job as a young professor, Nagpal was celebrating success with her research on the cover of Science magazine—all while following a fixed schedule.
