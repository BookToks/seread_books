But now, things are different.

A big reason social media grew so fast is because it skips the hard work of making something valuable and just gives you attention anyway. Instead of earning your fans by creating good stuff, it works like this: I’ll pay attention to you if you pay attention to me, no matter how good or bad the content is. If you put the kind of stuff from Facebook or Twitter into a blog or TV show, almost no one would watch it.

But on social media, people still like and comment on that same content. The unspoken rule is that if your friends and followers give you attention—even if you don’t really deserve it—you have to give it back to them. You “like” my post, I’ll “like” yours. This way, everyone feels important without putting in much effort.

If you stop using social media suddenly, you can see how popular you really are. For most people, the truth might be a bit disappointing—only your closest friends and family will notice you’re gone. I know I sound grumpy about this, but it’s important to talk about because wanting to feel important keeps people wasting their time on social media without thinking.

For some people, like college students or online personalities, quitting social media for a month will be tough and cause problems. People will notice if you stop. But for most, this break might not change everything, but it will help you see how social media fits into your life. These sites aren’t as important as they say. They’re just products made by companies who want to grab and sell your attention and personal info to advertisers. They can be fun, but in the big picture, they’re just small distractions that might stop you from focusing on what really matters. Or maybe social media is super important to you. You won’t know until you try living without it for a while.
