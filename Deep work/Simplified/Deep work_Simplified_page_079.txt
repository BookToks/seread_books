These efforts were mostly about deep work—but a kind of deep work we haven’t seen before. Brattain would focus hard to design experiments using Bardeen’s new ideas. Then Bardeen would focus hard to understand what Brattain’s experiments showed and try to improve his theories to fit the results. This back-and-forth is a team way of doing deep work (common in colleges) that uses what I call the whiteboard effect. For some problems, working with someone else at a shared whiteboard can help you think deeper than working alone. Having someone else waiting for your next idea—whether in the same room or online—can stop you from avoiding deep thinking.

Now we can look at what this means for working with others during deep work. The success of Building 20 and Bell Labs shows that being alone isn’t needed for productive deep work. Actually, their example shows that for many kinds of work—especially when trying to invent new things—working deeply together can give better results. So, you should think about working with others when planning how to focus deeply in your job. But keep these two rules in mind.

First, distractions still ruin deep thinking. So, the hub-and-spoke model is important. Keep your chances to meet people by chance separate from your time to think deeply. Try to make each time work well on its own, instead of mixing them up and making both harder.

Second, even when you go somewhere quiet to think deeply, if it makes sense to use the whiteboard effect, do it. Working side by side with someone on a problem can push both of you to think deeper and create better results than working alone.

In short, when it comes to deep work, think about working with others if it fits, because it can take your work to a higher level. But don’t get so caught up in meeting and sharing ideas that you lose the focus needed to turn those ideas into something useful.
