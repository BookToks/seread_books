Please don’t ask for them.

Stephenson explained why he’s hard to reach in an essay called “Why I Am a Bad Correspondent.” He says that his productivity doesn’t work in a simple way. If he can have long, uninterrupted blocks of time, he can write novels. But if his time is broken up into small pieces, he can’t write well.

He sees two choices: either write good novels regularly or answer lots of emails and go to conferences but write slower and with lower quality. He picked the first option, so he avoids anything that wastes his time. This idea was so important that he wrote about it in his 2008 sci-fi book, Anathem, about people who live like monks to focus deeply without distractions.

Some people who work with knowledge don’t like this idea because their jobs are more complicated. For example, a high-level manager might be very important but can’t point to one clear thing they made, like a finished novel. So, this “monk” way of working only fits certain people—and that’s fine. If you’re not one of those people, don’t be too jealous. But if you are someone whose work is clear and individual, you should think about this idea seriously. It might be the difference between a normal career and a famous one.

The book started with a story about Carl Jung, a famous psychologist and thinker.
