To explain this idea, let’s look at where it started.

The theory has many roots, but I have a personal connection to a famous one. For seven years, I worked at MIT in a building called Building 20. It was at the corner of Main and Vassar Streets in East Cambridge and was torn down in 1998. It was built quickly during World War II to hold extra people from the busy Radiation Laboratory. A 2012 New Yorker article said the building was not very good: “The air was bad and hallways were dark. The walls were thin, the roof leaked, and it was very hot in summer and freezing in winter.” But after the war, scientists kept coming to Cambridge.

MIT needed more space, so they didn’t tear down Building 20 right away, even though they promised local officials they would. Instead, they kept using it for extra space. Because of this, lots of different departments—like nuclear science, linguistics, and electronics—worked together in the building. There were even unusual groups like a machine shop and a piano repair shop. Since the building was cheap, people could easily change the space when they needed to.

They could move walls and floors and attach equipment to the beams. The New Yorker article tells how Jerrold Zacharias, working on the first atomic clock, removed two floors in his lab so he could put in a big three-story cylinder for his experiment.

At MIT, people believe that this mix of different fields in a flexible building led to random meetings and creative ideas. This helped many important inventions happen quickly, like Chomsky’s grammar ideas, Loran radars for navigation, and video games—all during the busy years after the war. When Building 20 was finally torn down to build the fancy $300 million Stata Center (where I worked later), many were sad to see it go. To honor the old “plywood palace,” the new building’s inside design includes unfinished wood and concrete with construction marks still visible.

At the same time Building 20 was built, a different plan to encourage creativity was happening in Murray Hill, New Jersey, about 200 miles away. There, Bell Labs director Mervin Kelly helped build a new lab designed to get scientists and engineers from different fields to meet and work together.
