And you weren't even born yet.\"  \n\n\"What's a mugwort?\" Mariam asked.  \n\n\"A weed,\" Nana said. \"Something you rip out and toss aside.\"  \n\nMariam frowned internally. Jalil didn't treat her as a weed. He never had. But Mariam thought it wise to suppress this protest.  \n\n\"Unlike weeds, I had to be replanted, you see, given food and water. On account of you. That was the deal Jalil made with his family.\"  \n\nNana said she had refused to live in Herat.  \n\n\"For what? To watch him drive his kinchini wives around town all day?\"  \n\nShe said she wouldn't live in her father's empty house either, in the village of Gul Daman, which sat on a steep hill two kilometers north of Herat.

The path ended perpendicular to a wide, trout-filled stream, which rolled down from the Safid-koh mountains surrounding Gul Daman. Two hundred yards upstream, toward the mountains, there was a circular grove of weeping willow trees. In the center, in the shade of the willows, was the clearing.  \n\nJalil went there to have a look. When he came back, Nana said, he sounded like a warden bragging about the clean walls and shiny floors of his prison.  \n\n\"And so, your father built us this rathole.\"  \n\n* * *  \n\nNana had almost married once, when she was fifteen. The suitor had been a boy from Shindand, a young parakeet seller.
