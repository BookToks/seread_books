  "text": "A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS             \n7  \nNana used to be one of the housekeepers. Then she got pregnant.  \nWhen that happened, the shock from Jalil's family was like a punch to the gut. They freaked out. His in-laws threatened violence. The wives demanded he kick her out. Nana's dad, a stone carver from Gul Daman, disowned her. He packed up and took a bus to Bran, disappearing for good.  \n\n\"Sometimes,\" Nana said one morning while feeding the chickens outside their small house, \"I wish my dad had the guts to use one of his knives and end it all. It might've been better for me.\" She tossed more seeds into the coop, paused, and looked at Mariam. \"Maybe it would've been better for you too. You wouldn’t have to deal with the pain of knowing who you are. But he was a coward. No heart for it.\"  \n\nJalil didn’t have the heart either, Nana said. He wouldn’t stand up to his family or take responsibility for what he did. Instead, he made a quick deal behind closed doors. The next day, he made her pack her stuff from the servants' quarters and sent her away.  \n\n\"You know what he told his wives to defend himself? That I forced him. That it was my fault. Didi? This is what it means to be a woman in this world.\"  \n\nNana set down the bowl of chicken feed and lifted Mariam's chin with her finger.  \n\n\"Look at me, Mariam.\"  \n\nMariam hesitated but finally looked up.  \n\nNana said, \"Learn this now and learn it well, my daughter: Like a compass that always points north, a man’s accusing finger always finds a woman. Always. Remember that, Mariam.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Nana teaches Mariam that in their world, women are often blamed for men's actions and suffer the consequences of male cowardice."
