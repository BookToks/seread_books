  "text": "A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS             \n5 \nPART ONE \n \n1. \n\nMariam was five when she first heard the word harami. \n\nIt was a Thursday. She remembered because she always felt restless on Thursdays, the day Jalil visited her at the kolba (a small house). To kill time before he arrived, Mariam climbed onto a chair and grabbed her mom's Chinese tea set. This was the only thing Mariam's mom, Nana, had from her own mother, who died when Nana was just two. Nana loved every piece of that blue-and-white porcelain set—the pot’s elegant spout, the hand-painted finches and chrysanthemums, and the dragon on the sugar bowl meant to keep evil away. \n\nBut then, the sugar bowl slipped from Mariam's hands and shattered on the wooden floor. \n\nWhen Nana saw the broken bowl, her face turned red, and her lip trembled. Her eyes—both the lazy one and the good one—fixed on Mariam in a cold, unblinking stare. Nana looked so furious that Mariam worried the jinn (a spirit) would come back. But it didn’t happen this time. Instead, Nana yanked Mariam by the wrists, pulled her close, and, through gritted teeth, spat out, “You are a clumsy little harami. This is my reward for everything I’ve endured—an heirloom-breaking, clumsy little harami.” \n\nAt that moment, Mariam didn’t get it. She didn’t know what harami—bastard—meant. She was too young to see the unfairness of it, that the blame lay with the people who made her a harami, not with her, who had done nothing wrong except be born. But she sensed from Nana’s tone that being a harami was something disgusting, like the cockroaches Nana always cursed and swept away. \n\nAs she grew older, Mariam began to understand. It was the way Nana spat the word that made its sting hit hard. She realized that a harami was unwanted; that she, Mariam, was an illegitimate person who would never have the same rights to love, family, home, or acceptance as others. \n\nJalil never called her that. He called her his little flower. He loved to sit her on his lap and tell her stories, like how Herat, where Mariam was born in 1959, was once the heart of Persian culture, home to writers, painters, and Sufis. \n\n“You couldn’t stretch a leg here without poking a poet in the ass,” he laughed. 🌸\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Mariam, a young girl, grapples with her identity as an illegitimate child, feeling the sting of her mother's harsh words and the societal stigma attached to being a \"harami.\""
