And you weren’t even born yet.\"  \n\n\"What’s a mugwort?\" Mariam asked.  \n\n\"A weed,\" Nana replied. \"Something you rip out and toss aside.\"  \n\nMariam frowned inside. Jalil didn’t treat her like a weed. He never had. But she kept that thought to herself.  \n\n\"Unlike weeds, I had to be replanted, you see, given food and water. That was the deal Jalil made with his family.\"  \n\nNana refused to live in Herat.  \n\n\"For what? To watch him drive his other wives around all day?\"  \n\nShe also wouldn’t stay in her father’s empty house in Gul Daman, which was on a steep hill two kilometers north of Herat. She wanted to be somewhere away from prying eyes—far from neighbors who’d stare at her belly, point, snicker, or, worse, shower her with fake kindness.  \n\n\"And believe me,\" Nana said, \"it was a relief for your father having me out of sight. It suited him just fine.\"  \n\nIt was Muhsin, Jalil’s eldest son from his first wife, Khadija, who suggested a clearing. It was on the outskirts of Gul Daman.

It wound uphill to a flat field with tall poplars, cottonwoods, and wild bushes. From up there, you could see the tips of the rusty windmill blades in Gul Daman on one side and all of Herat spread out below on the other. The path ended near a wide stream filled with trout, flowing down from the Safid-koh mountains. Two hundred yards upstream, there was a circular grove of weeping willows. In the shade of those trees was the clearing.  \n\nJalil checked it out. When he came back, Nana said he sounded like a warden bragging about his prison’s clean walls and shiny floors.  \n\n\"And so, your father built us this rathole.\"  \n\n* * *  \n\nNana almost got married once when she was fifteen. The suitor was a boy from Shindand, a young parakeet seller. Mariam knew the story from Nana herself, and though...\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Nana reflects on her past and the circumstances surrounding her relationship with Jalil, expressing her disdain for societal judgment and her desire for isolation."
