I didn’t eat or sleep, just pushed and prayed for you to come out.”  \n\n“I'm sorry, Nana.”  \n\n“I cut the cord myself. That’s why I had a knife.”  \n\n“I’m sorry.”  \n\nNana always gave this slow, heavy smile, like she was torn between holding a grudge and forgiving. Mariam could never figure it out. It didn’t even cross her mind to think it was unfair to apologize for how she was born.  \n\nBy the time she turned ten, Mariam stopped believing Nana’s story. She started believing Jalil’s version. He said he arranged for Nana to go to a hospital in Herat, where a doctor helped her. She lay on a clean bed in a nice, bright room. When Mariam mentioned the knife, Jalil shook his head sadly.  \n\nMariam also began to doubt she had made her mom suffer for two whole days.  \n\n“They told me it was over in under an hour,” Jalil said. “You were a good daughter, Mariam jo. Even in birth, you were good.”  \n\n“He wasn’t even there!” Nana shot back. “He was off horseback riding with his buddies in Takht-e-Safar.”  \n\nWhen they told Jalil he had a new daughter, Nana said he just shrugged, kept brushing his horse’s mane, and stayed away for another two weeks.  \n\n“The truth is, he didn’t even hold you until you were a month old. And then he just looked at your long face and handed you back to me.”  \n\nMariam doubted this part too. Sure, Jalil admitted he was riding in Takht-e-Safar, but when he got the news, he didn’t shrug. He jumped on his horse and rode back to Herat. He held her, ran his thumb over her flaky eyebrows, and hummed a lullaby. Mariam didn’t picture him commenting on her long face, even if it was true.  \n\nNana said she chose the name Mariam because it was her mother’s name. Jalil said he picked it because Mariam, the tuberose, was a beautiful flower.  \n\n“Your favorite?” Mariam asked.  \n\n“Well, one of,” he smiled. 🌸\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Mariam grapples with conflicting narratives about her birth and the relationships with her parents, revealing her struggle for identity and understanding."
