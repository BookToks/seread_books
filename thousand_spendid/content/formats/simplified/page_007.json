  "text": "A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS             \n7 \n\nNana used to be one of the housekeepers. But everything changed when she got pregnant. When that happened, Jalil's family gasped in shock. His in-laws said there would be trouble. The wives insisted that he should get rid of her. Nana's father, who was a poor stone carver from the nearby village of Gul Daman, disowned her. Ashamed, he packed his things and left for Bran, never to return.  \n\n\"Sometimes,\" Nana said one morning while feeding the chickens outside the kolba, \"I wish my father had been brave enough to take one of his knives and end it all. It might have been better for me.\" She threw more seeds into the coop, paused, and looked at Mariam. \"It might have been better for you too. It would have saved you from knowing what you are. But he was a coward. He didn't have the heart to do it.\"  \n\nNana said Jalil also didn't have the heart to do the right thing. He didn't stand up to his family, his wives, or take responsibility for what happened. Instead, he quickly made a deal behind closed doors. The next day, he told her to pack her things from the servants' quarters where she lived and sent her away.  \n\n\"Do you know what he told his wives to defend himself? He said I forced myself on him. That it was my fault. Didi? This is what it means to be a woman in this world.\"  \n\nNana set down the bowl of chicken feed and lifted Mariam's chin with her finger.  \n\n\"Look at me, Mariam.\"  \n\nMariam looked at her reluctantly.  \n\nNana said, \"Learn this now and remember it well, my daughter: Just like a compass needle always points north, a man's accusing finger always finds a woman. Always. Remember that, Mariam.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Nana teaches Mariam that in their world, women are often blamed for men's actions and suffer the consequences of male cowardice."
