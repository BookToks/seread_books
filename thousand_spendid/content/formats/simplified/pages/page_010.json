  "text": "A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS             \n10 \n\n\"Don't rush me. You made me lie on that cold, hard floor for almost two days. I didn't eat or sleep; all I did was push and pray for you to come out.\"  \n\n\"I'm sorry, Nana.\"  \n\n\"I cut the cord between us myself. That's why I had a knife.\"  \n\n\"I'm sorry.\"  \n\nNana always gave a slow smile that seemed heavy with feelings, but Mariam could never tell if it was about blame or forgiveness. Young Mariam didn't think about how unfair it was to apologize for how she was born.  \n\nBy the time she turned ten, Mariam stopped believing the story of her birth. She believed Jalil's version, that even though he was away, he arranged for Nana to go to a hospital in Herat where a doctor took care of her. She lay on a clean bed in a bright room. Jalil looked sad when Mariam told him about the knife.  \n\nMariam also started to doubt that she made her mother suffer for two full days.  \n\n\"They told me it was all over in less than an hour,\" Jalil said. \"You were a good daughter, Mariam jo. Even at birth, you were a good daughter.\"  \n\n\"He wasn't even there!\" Nana yelled. \"He was in Takht-e-Safar, riding horses with his precious friends.\"  \n\nWhen they told him he had a new daughter, Nana said Jalil just shrugged, kept brushing his horse's mane, and stayed in Takht-e-Safar for another two weeks.  \n\n\"The truth is, he didn't even hold you until you were a month old. And then he just looked at you once, said you had a long face, and gave you back to me.\"  \n\nMariam stopped believing that part too. Yes, Jalil admitted he was riding horses in Takht-e-Safar, but when he got the news, he didn't shrug. He rode back to Herat right away. He held her in his arms, ran his thumb over her dry eyebrows, and sang her a lullaby. Mariam didn't imagine Jalil saying her face was long, even though it was true.  \n\nNana said she picked the name Mariam because it was her mother's name. Jalil said he chose it because Mariam, the tuberose, was a beautiful flower.  \n\n\"Is it your favorite?\" Mariam asked.  \n\n\"Well, one of them,\" he said and smiled.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Mariam grapples with conflicting narratives about her birth and the relationships with her parents, revealing her struggle for identity and understanding."
