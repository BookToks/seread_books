  "text": "A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS             \n5 \nPART ONE \n\n1. \n\nMariam was five years old the first time she heard the word harami. \n\nIt was a Thursday. Mariam remembered this because she felt restless that day, like she always did on Thursdays when Jalil visited her at the kolba. To pass the time until she saw him, crossing the grass and waving, Mariam climbed onto a chair and took down her mother's Chinese tea set. This tea set was the only thing Mariam's mother, Nana, had from her own mother, who died when Nana was two. Nana loved each blue-and-white piece, especially the pot's spout, the hand-painted birds and flowers, and the dragon on the sugar bowl meant to keep evil away. \n\nBut then, the sugar bowl slipped from Mariam's hands and fell to the wooden floor, breaking into pieces. \n\nWhen Nana saw the bowl, her face turned red, and she looked very angry. Mariam was scared that the jinn would come back into her mother. But the jinn didn't come that time. Instead, Nana grabbed Mariam's wrists, pulled her close, and said through clenched teeth, \"You are a clumsy little harami! This is my reward for everything I've been through—breaking my heirloom, you clumsy little harami.\" \n\nAt that moment, Mariam didn't understand what the word harami—bastard—meant. She was too young to see that it wasn't her fault for being born. But she could tell from Nana's tone that being a harami was something bad, like an insect, similar to the cockroaches Nana always cursed and swept out of the kolba. \n\nLater, when Mariam was older, she understood better. It was how Nana said the word, almost like she was spitting it at her, that made Mariam feel its sting. She realized that a harami was something unwanted; that she, Mariam, was an illegitimate child who would never have the same things as others, like love, family, home, and acceptance. \n\nJalil never called Mariam this name. He called her his little flower. He liked to sit her on his lap and tell her stories, like how Herat, the city where Mariam was born in 1959, used to be the heart of Persian culture, home to writers, artists, and Sufis. \n\n\"You couldn't stretch a leg here without poking a poet in the butt,\" he laughed.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Mariam, a young girl, grapples with her identity as an illegitimate child, feeling the sting of her mother's harsh words and the societal stigma attached to being a \"harami.\""
