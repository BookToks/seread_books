The article I got these steps from is by Ron White. 

It’s called “How to Memorize a Deck of Cards with Superhuman Speed.” 

You can find it online as a guest post on The Art of Manliness website. 

It was published on June 1, 2012. 

Here’s the link if you want to check it out: http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/06/01/how-to-memorize-a-deck-of-cards/.
