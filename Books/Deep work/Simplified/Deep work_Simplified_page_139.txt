Since email is such a big part of work these days, there’s something surprising about how I handle my work: I don’t work after 5:30 p.m.

I call this way of working fixed-schedule productivity. That means I decide not to work past a certain time and then find ways to be productive before that time. I’ve been doing this for over five years, and it’s really helped me focus on deep, important work. I want to convince you to try it too.

At first, this idea might sound like it won’t work, especially where I work—in the academic world.

Professors, especially new ones, are known for working long hours, late into the night and on weekends. For example, a young computer science professor, let’s call him “Tom,” wrote about his day in 2014. He spent 12 hours at his office, had five meetings, and did three hours of “administrative” work like answering lots of emails and planning meetings. But he only spent one and a half hours doing what he called “real” work that helped with his research. No wonder Tom feels like he has to work nights and weekends. He even said he accepted that this is just how it is for most junior professors. But I’m different. Even though I don’t work late or much on weekends, from 2011 to 2014 I published around 20 articles, won two big grants, published a book, and almost finished another—all without working crazy hours like Tom.

How is that possible? A great explanation comes from a successful professor named Radhika Nagpal at Harvard. She said that a lot of the stress professors feel comes from themselves. She started by saying there are a lot of scary ideas and facts about being a new professor at a research university, but then she chose to ignore those ideas and decided to work differently…
