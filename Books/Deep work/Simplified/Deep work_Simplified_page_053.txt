“Every piece of wood is different, so it has its own character,” they say after talking about the wheelwright’s work. “The woodworker knows the wood really well. Its small special qualities ask to be cared for and brought out.” They point out that this respect for the wood’s qualities shows something important in today’s world: meaning can come from outside yourself. The wheelwright doesn’t just choose which parts of the wood are good or not; the value is already in the wood and what it’s supposed to do.

Dreyfus and Kelly explain that this kind of respect is common in craftsmanship. They say the craftsman’s job “is not to create meaning, but to learn how to see the meanings that are already there.” This helps the craftsman avoid feeling like life is meaningless and gives a clear, ordered sense of purpose. At the same time, this meaning feels safer than old ideas. The authors suggest the wheelwright can’t use the wood’s qualities to support a cruel ruler.

Thinking about job satisfaction, Dreyfus and Kelly’s idea about craftsmanship helps us understand why people like Ric Furrer’s work feels special to many of us. The happy look on Furrer’s face when he turns rough metal into art, these thinkers say, shows a feeling of something rare and important today: a touch of the sacred.

Once we get this, we can see how this sacred feeling in traditional crafts also applies to knowledge work. But first, two important points. The first is simple but important: manual labor isn’t the only way to find this kind of meaning. Any activity—whether physical or mental—that needs high skill can also bring a sense of sacredness.

To explain this, let’s move from old crafts like wood carving or metalwork to a modern example: computer programming. Look at what coding genius Santiago Gonzalez said about his work in an interview: Beautiful code is short and clear, so if another programmer reads it, they’d say, “oh, that’s really good code.” It’s kind of like writing a poem.
