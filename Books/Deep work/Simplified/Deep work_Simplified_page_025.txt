Right after I met Grant, I was thinking about my own schoolwork, so I asked him how he gets so much done. Luckily, he was happy to talk about it. Grant thinks a lot about how to work really well. He even sent me some PowerPoint slides from a workshop he went to with other professors. The workshop was all about using data to figure out the best way to do academic work. The slides had pie charts showing how to spend time during the year, a flowchart for working with co-authors, and a list of over twenty books to read. These business professors aren’t like the stereotype of forgetful academics who just stumble on ideas. They treat productivity like a science problem to solve—and Grant seems to have figured it out.

One big part of Grant’s method is that he groups hard but important work into long, uninterrupted blocks of time. He does this in different ways. For example, he teaches mostly in the fall semester. That way, he can focus fully on teaching and helping students then. This seems to work well because he’s the highest-rated teacher at Wharton and has won many teaching awards. Then, in the spring and summer, he focuses fully on research without distractions.

Grant also organizes his time during a semester dedicated to research. Sometimes, he keeps his door open to students and coworkers, and sometimes he closes it and works alone on one research task without interruptions. He breaks writing a paper into three steps: analyzing data, writing a full draft, and editing it to polish it. When he’s in these focused periods, which can last three or four days, he even sets an automatic reply on his email to let people know he won’t answer right away. His colleagues find this funny because they see him in his office, but to Grant, being totally alone during these times is really important.

I think Grant doesn’t work way more hours than other top professors, who usually work a lot anyway, but he still gets more done than almost everyone else in his field. I believe it’s because he groups his work into intense, focused bursts. He follows this simple rule: Good Work = Time Spent × Focus. So, by focusing hard when he works, he gets the most done in the time he spends.
