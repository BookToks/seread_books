The issue of Science where Radhika Nagpal’s work appears on the cover: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6172.toc; Science 343.6172 (February 14, 2014): 701–808.

It’s getting harder to explain things well because we keep losing that skill. This idea comes from page 13 of John Freeman’s book, The Tyranny of E-mail: The Four-Thousand-Year Journey to Your Inbox.

If you want to see how I use my sender filters, check out: http://calnewport.com/contact/.

“So, when I emailed Cal to ask if he…” is a quote from Jocelyn Glei’s article called “Stop the Insanity: How to Crush Communication Overload” on 99U: http://99u.com/articles/7002/stop-the-insanity-how-to-crush-communication-overload.

At some point, too many people start reaching out to you. For more about how Clay Herbert and Antonio Centeno use filters, see Michael Simmons’ Forbes article, “Open Relationship Building: The 15-Minute Habit That Transforms Your Network,” from June 24, 2014: http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelsimmons/2014/06/24/open-relationship-building-the15-minute-habit-that-transforms-your-network/.

This Forbes article also talks about my own sender filter habit. I actually suggested the name “sender filter” to Michael Simmons, who’s a good friend. You can see how Antonio’s filters work here: http://www.realmenrealstyle.com/contact/.

Tim Ferriss talks about “developing the habit of letting small bad things happen” on his blog, in a post called “The Art of Letting Bad Things Happen,” from October 25, 2007: http://fourhourworkweek.com/2007/10/25/weapons-of-mass-distractions-and-the-art-of-letting-bad-thingshappen/.

In conclusion, being super focused is an amazing skill. Walter Isaacson wrote about this in a Harvard Gazette article called “Dawn of a Revolution,” September 2013: http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/09/dawn-of-a-revolution/.

Isaacson also said the one thing that made Bill Gates different from Paul Allen was focus. This quote is from Chapter 6, Part 2 of Isaacson’s book The Innovators, in the audio version.

Most of the Bill Gates story comes from Isaacson’s “Dawn of a Revolution” article, which he adapted from his book The Innovators. I also used some info from Stephen Manes’s 1994 biography, Gates: How Microsoft’s Mogul Reinvented an Industry—and Made Himself the Richest Man in America.

Cal Newport wrote a book called So Good They Can’t Ignore You: Why Skill Trumps Passion in the Quest for Work You Love. It was published in 2012 by Business Plus in New York.

You can find a list of my computer science papers by year on my academic website: http://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~cnewport. The papers from my “year of living deeply” are under 2014. Keep in mind that computer scientists like me mostly publish at conferences, not journals, and we usually list authors alphabetically, not by who contributed the most.

Lastly, I’ll live a focused life, as mentioned on page 14 of the book Rapt by Gallagher.
