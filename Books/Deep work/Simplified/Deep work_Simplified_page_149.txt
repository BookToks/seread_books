I’d like to stop by sometime to talk about <topic X>. Are you free?

Answering this message is hard because “Are you free?” is too vague. Also, it doesn’t explain why this chat is important for the professor. So, here’s a better version that might get a reply: Hi professor. I’m working on a project like <topic X> with my advisor, <professor Y>. Can I stop by during the last 15 minutes of your office hours on Thursday to tell you more about it and see if it fits with your work?

This message is clearer about why the meeting is a good idea and makes it easy for the professor to say yes.

This tip says you should try to handle emails like professors do, whenever possible. To help you, use these three rules to decide which emails need a reply and which don’t.

Professorial E-mail Sorting: Don’t reply if:  
• The message is unclear or hard to answer.  
• It’s not something you care about.  
• Nothing good or bad will happen if you don’t reply.

Of course, there are exceptions. If a confusing email comes from your company’s CEO, you’ll probably reply. But aside from these cases, this professor-style way means you should be more strict about when to hit “reply.” It might feel weird at first because usually people reply to all emails, no matter what. Also, some people might get confused or upset if you don’t reply, especially if they expect normal email rules.
