So, if you’re in a market where people can see all the options and know how good each one is, they will pick the very best. Even if the best is only a little better than the next one, the superstars still get most of the business.

Back in the 1980s, Rosen studied this idea using examples like movie stars and musicians. There were clear places to buy their stuff, like music stores and movie theaters, where fans could easily choose who they wanted because they knew how good each performer was. Now, with new technology, lots of local markets have become global. A small company looking for a programmer or a public relations expert can now find talent from anywhere in the world, just like a music fan in a small town can buy albums from famous bands instead of local ones. So, the superstar effect is happening in more areas today than Rosen could have imagined 30 years ago. More people are competing with the top stars in their fields.

The last group that will do well in this new economy—like John Doerr—are the people who have money to invest in new technologies that are changing everything. We’ve known since Marx that having money gives you big advantages. But some times are better for investing than others. For example, after World War II in Europe was a bad time to have lots of cash because inflation and taxes quickly destroyed wealth (kind of like in the show "Downton Abbey").

The Great Restructuring, unlike that time, is a great time to have money to invest. To understand this, remember that usually, when money is made by combining investment and work, the rewards are split based on how much each person puts in. But because digital technology needs less work in many industries, the people who own the smart machines get a bigger share of the rewards. For example, a venture capitalist today can invest in a company like Instagram, which sold for a billion dollars but only had thirteen employees.
