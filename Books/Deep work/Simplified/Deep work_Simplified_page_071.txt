In a New York Times article, David Brooks explains this clearly: “[Great creative minds] think like artists but work like accountants.” This means that to do your best deep work, you should create rituals that are just as strict and unique as those used by famous thinkers like Caro and Darwin.

They didn’t have rituals just to be different. They needed them because their success depended on being able to focus deeply again and again. You can’t win big awards or come up with big ideas without pushing your brain to work hard.

Their rituals made it easier to get into a deep focus and stay there longer. If they waited for inspiration before starting, they probably wouldn’t have achieved as much.

There isn’t one perfect ritual for deep work — it depends on the person and the project. But good rituals should answer some important questions:

• Where and for how long you’ll work. Your ritual should pick a place for deep work, like your office with the door closed or a quiet library. If you can find a special spot just for focus, even better. If you work in an open office, finding a quiet place is really important. Also, set a clear time limit so the session feels like a real challenge, not something that drags on forever.

• How you’ll work once you start. Your ritual needs rules to keep you focused. For example, no internet or tracking how many words you write every 20 minutes. Without rules, you’ll waste energy deciding what to do and if you’re working hard enough, which tires you out.

• How you’ll support your work. Your ritual should help your brain stay sharp. Maybe start with a good cup of coffee, have some healthy snacks ready, or do light exercise like walking to keep your mind clear.
