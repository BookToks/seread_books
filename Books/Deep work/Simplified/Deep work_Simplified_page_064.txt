In the 1920s, Jung wanted to think and work deeply, away from his teacher Freud. He built a simple stone house in the woods near a small town called Bollingen. Every morning there, Jung locked himself in a plain room to write without being disturbed. After writing, he would meditate and walk in the woods to clear his mind and get ready for the next day’s work. I believe he did this to focus deeply and be smart enough to challenge Freud and his followers.

I want to point out something important: Jung didn’t live a super strict, monk-like life all the time. Some people, like Donald Knuth and Neal Stephenson, try to avoid all distractions all the time. But Jung only did this deep focus during his retreat time. The rest of the time, he lived in Zurich, where he had a busy life. He worked late seeing patients, hung out in coffee shops, and went to many university lectures. (Einstein also studied and worked in Zurich and even had dinner with Jung to talk about his ideas.) Jung’s life in Zurich was kind of like how busy digital workers live today—imagine a busy tech CEO in San Francisco.

Jung’s way is what I call the “bimodal philosophy” of deep work. This means you split your time into two parts: some time is for deep, focused work, and the rest is for everything else. When you do deep work, you focus really hard without interruptions. When you’re not doing deep work, you don’t try to focus so much. This can happen in different ways. For example, you might spend a long weekend fully focused, and the rest of the week more relaxed.

Or, you might spend a whole season or a few months focused, like how some teachers spend their summers working deeply.

The bimodal philosophy says deep work can help you be super productive, but only if you spend enough time doing it to reach a high level of focus—where real new ideas happen. That’s why deep work sessions should last at least a full day. Just working deeply for a few hours in the morning isn’t enough for this approach.
