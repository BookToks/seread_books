We can now take a step back and use Gallagher’s big idea to better understand how deep work helps us live a good life. This idea says that your world is shaped by what you focus on, so think about what happens in your mind when you spend a lot of time on serious, focused tasks. Deep work feels important, whether you’re Ric Furrer making a sword or a programmer fixing a computer problem. Gallagher’s idea says that if you spend enough time doing this kind of work, your mind will see your world as full of meaning and importance.

There’s also a hidden but super important benefit to focusing really hard during your workday: it grabs all your attention and stops you from noticing the small, annoying things that always pop up in life. The psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who we’ll learn about next, talks about this. He says intense focus means you don’t have any attention left to worry about other stuff or problems. This is especially true in knowledge work, which is always connected to the internet and full of distractions. If you pay too much attention to these distractions, they can make your world feel less meaningful.

To make this clearer, I’ll use myself as an example. Think about the last five emails I sent before starting this chapter. Here are their subjects and what they were about:  
• Re: URGENT calnewport Brand Registration Confirmation. This was a reply to a common scam where a company tries to trick website owners into registering their sites in China. I was annoyed they kept spamming me, so I lost my cool and told them their scam would be better if they spelled “website” right.  
• Re: S R. This was a chat with a family member about an article he saw in the Wall Street Journal.  
• Re: Important Advice. This was part of a talk about the best ways to invest for retirement.
