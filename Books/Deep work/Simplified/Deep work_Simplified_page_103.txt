First, figure out which important things you need to pay attention to. Then, decide the exact question you want to answer using those things. For example, if you’re working on a book chapter, you might ask, “How should I start this chapter well?” Or if you’re doing a proof, you might ask, “What could go wrong if I don’t assume this is true?” When you know what to focus on and what question to ask, you have a clear goal to work on.

If you can answer that question, the last step is to review what you learned and make sure you understand it well. After that, you can start over again and dig even deeper. This way of thinking is like a tough workout for your brain. It helps you get better at focusing and thinking deeply during your study or meditation time.

Daniel Kilov can memorize amazing things in just five minutes, like a shuffled deck of cards, 100 random numbers, or 115 weird shapes (he even set a national record for that). Because of this, he won two silver medals in the Australian memory championships. What’s surprising is that he didn’t always have a great memory.

Kilov said he wasn’t born with a good memory. In high school, he often forgot things and was messy. He also had a hard time in school and was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder. But after meeting Tansel Ali, a top Australian memory champion, Kilov started practicing his memory seriously. By the time he finished college, he had already won a medal in a national competition.

Kilov’s change into a top mental athlete happened fast but isn’t unique. In 2006, Joshua Foer, an American writer, won the USA Memory Championship after just one year of hard training. He wrote about it in his book Moonwalking with Einstein. The important part of Kilov’s story is that while training his memory, he went from struggling in school to graduating with top honors from a tough university in Australia.
