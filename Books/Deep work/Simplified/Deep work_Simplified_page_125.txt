Luckily, Arnold Bennett figured out the answer to this problem about a hundred years ago: Think more about how you spend your free time. Basically, this means when you relax, don’t just do whatever pops up on your phone or computer. Instead, plan ahead how you want to spend your “day within a day.” Addictive websites are hard to resist when you don’t have anything planned. But if you fill your free time with something better, you won’t get stuck on those distractions as much.

That’s why it’s really important to decide before your evenings and weekends start what you want to do. Having hobbies with clear goals helps because they give you something specific to focus on. For example, reading regularly, like Bennett suggested, is a good way to spend time. You could also exercise or hang out with friends in person.

For me, I manage to read a lot of books each year even though I’m busy as a professor, writer, and dad. Usually, I’m reading three to five books at once. One of my favorite planned activities after my kids go to bed is reading a good book. Because of this, I don’t spend much time on my phone or computer after work until the next morning.

You might worry that planning your free time too much will make you more tired, not more relaxed. Won’t having a schedule for relaxing make you feel worn out the next day? Bennett thought about this too. He said people misunderstand what really refreshes our minds: Our brains don’t get tired like our muscles. They just need a change, not rest—except when we sleep.

From my experience, he’s right. If you keep your mind busy with something meaningful all day, you’ll feel happier at night and more relaxed the next morning, compared to just wasting time scrolling on the web without a plan.
