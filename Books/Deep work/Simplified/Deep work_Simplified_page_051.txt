But Csikszentmihalyi’s studies show that most people get this wrong: Surprisingly, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time. That’s because work has built-in goals, feedback, and challenges that help people get involved, focus, and lose themselves in what they’re doing. Free time, on the other hand, has no structure and takes more effort to turn into something fun.

When researchers measured this, they found that people were happier at work and less happy when relaxing than they thought. The studies also showed that the more times people experience “flow” during a week, the happier they feel overall.

It seems that people are at their best when they’re fully focused on something challenging.

There is some overlap between flow theory and Winifred Gallagher’s ideas from the last section. Both say it’s better to focus deeply rather than shallowly, but they explain why differently.

Gallagher says that what you focus on matters. If you pay close attention to important things and ignore shallow negative stuff, your work life feels more meaningful and positive.

Csikszentmihalyi, on the other hand, doesn’t care as much about what you focus on. He thinks that just the feeling of going deep is rewarding. Our minds enjoy the challenge no matter what the subject is.

The link between deep work and flow is clear: Deep work helps you enter flow because it stretches your mind, makes you concentrate, and helps you lose yourself in what you’re doing—all things that create flow. And since flow makes you happy, this gives a strong psychological reason to focus deeply.

Research from Csikszentmihalyi’s experiments proves that going deep helps organize your mind in a way that makes life feel worthwhile.

Csikszentmihalyi even says companies should try to make jobs more like flow activities. But he knows this would be hard and disruptive. So, he says it’s even more important for people to learn how to find chances to experience flow on their own. The big lesson from all this is: Building your work life around flow and deep work is a sure way to find real satisfaction.
