Actually, people say they are just as busy as before. So, why does this seem different? A lot of it comes down to another kind of work that’s different from deep work: Shallow Work. This means easy tasks that don’t need much thinking and are often done while distracted. These tasks don’t create much new value and are simple to copy.

Today, with all the online tools we use, people who work with information are doing more shallow work instead of deep work. They spend a lot of time sending and checking emails like they’re passing messages, with lots of breaks to check other things. Big tasks that need serious thinking, like planning a new business or writing an important paper, get broken into short, distracted bursts that don’t turn out very well. Even worse, spending too much time doing shallow work can make it harder to focus deeply later on. Journalist Nicholas Carr said the internet was making it tough for him to concentrate and think deeply. He wasn’t alone. To write his book The Shallows, he had to go to a cabin and unplug completely.

The idea that online tools push us toward shallow work isn’t new. The Shallows was just the first book to talk about how the internet affects our brains and work habits. Other books like Hamlet’s BlackBerry, The Tyranny of E-mail, and The Distraction Addiction say the same thing: these tools distract us from work that needs long focus and make it harder to stay focused.

Since many books already show this, I won’t spend more time proving it here. Let’s agree that online tools hurt deep work. I also won’t get into big arguments about what this means for society because those debates are often impossible to settle. Some people, like Jaron Lanier and John Freeman, think these tools harm society as they are now. Others, like Clive Thompson, believe they change society but in ways that will help us. For example, Google might make us rely less on memory, but that’s okay because we can just search for anything we need right when we need it.
