When else in history has such a small amount of work created so much value? With very little effort from workers, most of the money goes to the people who own the machines—in this case, the venture investors. It’s no surprise that a venture capitalist I talked to said, “Everyone wants my job,” and sounded a bit worried.

Let’s sum up what we’ve talked about so far: Experts say that new technology is changing our economy in a huge way. In this new economy, three groups will have a big advantage: people who work well and creatively with smart machines, people who are the best at what they do, and people who have money to invest.

To be clear, this big change in the economy isn’t the only important thing happening right now, and these three groups aren’t the only ones who will do well. But for this book, it’s important to focus on these trends and groups because they will succeed. If you can be part of any of these groups, you’ll do well. If not, you might still do okay, but your position will be less stable.

Now the big question is: How do you join these winners? I have to be honest—I don’t have a secret way to get rich fast or become a top investor like John Doerr. (If I did, I wouldn’t share it in a book.) But the other two groups I mentioned are easier to join. We’ll talk about how to do that next.

How to Become a Winner in the New Economy I said there are two groups that will do really well and that you can join: people who work creatively with smart machines and people who are stars in their field. What’s the key to getting into these successful groups? I believe two main skills are really important.

Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy 1. The ability to learn difficult things quickly.

2. The ability to perform at a top level, both in quality and speed.
