Chapter Three: Deep Work Is Meaningful

Ric Furrer is a blacksmith. He makes metal items using old, ancient ways. He works in his shop called Door County Forgeworks. “I do all my work by hand and use tools that help me without stopping my creativity or feeling for the metal,” he says. “A big machine could do the job in one hit that takes me 100 hits by hand. But that’s not what I want. You can see my work was made by two hands.”

A 2012 PBS video shows a bit of Ric’s life. He works in an old barn in Wisconsin, near Sturgeon Bay by Lake Michigan. Sometimes he leaves the barn doors open, maybe to let out the heat from the forges. Outside, there are farm fields all the way to the horizon. It looks peaceful, but the work looks tough at first.

In the video, Ric is trying to make a Viking sword. He starts by using a 1,500-year-old way to melt steel in a small container. This makes a metal block about the size of three or four stacked smartphones. This heavy block must be shaped and polished into a long, beautiful sword blade.

“This first part, breaking it down, is the worst,” Ric says as he heats the metal, hits it with a hammer, turns it, hits it again, and puts it back in the fire to repeat. The video says it will take eight hours of hammering to finish shaping the sword. But when you watch Ric work, the hard labor feels different. He’s not just hitting the metal like a miner with a pickaxe. Every hit is strong but careful. He looks closely at the metal through his thin glasses, which look a little strange with his big beard and strong shoulders. He turns the metal just right before hitting it.

“You have to be very gentle or it will crack,” he says. After a few more hits, he adds, “You have to nudge it; slowly it breaks down; then you start to enjoy it.” Halfway through, after shaping the metal, Ric carefully rolls it in a narrow bed of burning charcoal.
