When a project starts because of an email you send or get, it stays on your mind—like something you have to deal with soon. This way, the project doesn’t hang around unfinished. By going through the whole process, adding tasks and appointments to your to-do list or calendar, and updating the other person, your brain can stop worrying about it. Having less mental clutter means you can think better and focus more.

Process-focused emails might feel weird at first. They make you spend more time planning what to say before you write. It might seem like you’re spending more time on email right then. But remember, those extra two or three minutes will save you much more time later because you won’t have to read and answer lots of extra messages.

Another problem is these emails can sound stiff and too technical. Normally, emails are casual and friendly, but process emails need to be more organized and clear. If this worries you, try adding a friendly introduction before the technical part. You can even separate the two with a line or label the technical part “Proposed Next Steps” so it feels okay.

In the end, these small annoyances are worth it. By thinking more about what your emails really mean, you’ll stop email from messing up your ability to do important work.

Tip #3: Don’t Respond. When I was a grad student at MIT, I met many famous professors.

I noticed they all shared an interesting way of handling email: they usually didn’t reply right away.

I learned why: they believed it’s the sender’s job to make the email worth replying to. If you didn’t explain clearly or make it easy for the professor to answer, you probably wouldn’t get a reply.

For example, an email that just says “Hi professor” probably wouldn’t get a response from many famous people there.
