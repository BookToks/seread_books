It’s a zero-sum game. This means your time can only be spent on one thing at a time. When you spend your time on important activities, you get way more rewards than when you spend it on less important stuff. So, the more time you spend on the less important things, the less you benefit overall.

Businesses get this. That’s why sometimes companies stop working with clients who don’t bring in much money. If 80% of their profits come from just 20% of their clients, it makes more sense to focus on those clients. Every hour spent on those big clients earns more money than hours spent on the smaller ones. The same is true for your goals. If you spend time on low-impact stuff like scrolling through old friends’ Facebook pages, you get less out of it than if you spent that time doing something important, like hanging out with a good friend. So, quitting a social network might mean you miss some small benefits, but you gain more by focusing on the things that really help you.

Going back to the start, for writers like Malcolm Gladwell, Michael Lewis, and George Packer, Twitter doesn’t help much with the most important parts of their work. Even if Twitter gives some small benefits, overall they’re probably better off not using it and spending that time on things that help them more. You should be just as careful about which apps or tools you let take your time and attention.

Now he wanted to take back control from all his possessions. His plan was simple but bold. He spent an afternoon packing everything he owned into boxes like he was moving. To make the task feel less hard, he called it a “packing party,” saying, “Everything’s more exciting when it’s a party, right?” After that, he spent the next week living his normal life.
