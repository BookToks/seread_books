The three strategies below are made to help you stop using anything just because it might be helpful. Instead, they want you to think like a craftsman, carefully choosing the tools that take your time and attention.

This advice is important because the craftsman way isn’t simple or clear-cut.

Figuring out what really matters to you and then judging how different tools affect those things isn’t easy. It takes practice and trying different things. The strategies coming up give you a way to practice by making you look at your online tools from different points of view. Together, they should help you have a better relationship with your tools so you can control your time and attention better, which will help you use the ideas in Part 2.

Use the Law of the Vital Few for your Internet habits. Malcolm Gladwell doesn’t use Twitter. In a 2013 interview, he said, “Who says my fans want to hear from me on Twitter?” He joked, “I know a lot of people would like to see less of me.” Michael Lewis, another famous author, also doesn’t use Twitter. He said in The Wire, “I don’t tweet, I don’t Twitter, I couldn’t even tell you how to read or where to find a Twitter message.” And as mentioned before, George Packer, a well-known New Yorker writer, also avoids Twitter and only recently got a smartphone because he had to.

These three writers don’t think Twitter is useless. They know other writers find it helpful. Packer even wrote about not using Twitter after reading a very positive article about it by David Carr, a New York Times media critic. Carr said that Twitter helps him keep up with news and people’s reactions quickly, like while waiting for coffee at Starbucks.

But Gladwell, Lewis, and Packer feel that Twitter doesn’t give them enough good things to make up for the bad parts, at least for their own lives.
