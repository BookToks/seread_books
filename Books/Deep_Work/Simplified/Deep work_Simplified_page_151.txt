Conclusion

The story of how Microsoft started is very famous. In the winter of 1974, a young Harvard student named Bill Gates saw the Altair, the world’s first personal computer, on the cover of Popular Electronics.

Gates saw a chance to make software for this new machine. So, he stopped everything else and, with help from Paul Allen and Monte Davidoff, spent eight weeks working hard to create a version of the BASIC programming language for the Altair. This story shows Gates’s smart ideas and boldness, but recent talks also show another important thing: Gates’s amazing ability to focus deeply.

As Walter Isaacson explained in a 2013 article for the Harvard Gazette, Gates worked so intensely during these two months that he sometimes fell asleep right on his keyboard while coding. He would sleep for an hour or two, wake up, and keep going exactly where he left off. Paul Allen called this “a prodigious feat of concentration.” In his book The Innovators, Isaacson said that what made Gates different from Allen was focus. Allen’s mind jumped around many ideas, but Gates stuck with one thing until it was done.

This story about Gates’s deep focus is the best example of why deep work matters. Today, with so many distractions, people often argue about whether being on phones and online is good or bad. Some people miss the old days of calm focus, while others think being connected all the time is the future.

Marshall McLuhan said “the medium is the message,” but now it feels like people think “the medium is morality”—either you support the online future or you think it’s the end of the world.

As I said in the introduction, I don’t care about this argument. Choosing to do deep work isn’t about being good or bad or taking a side. It’s just a smart way to get important things done. Deep work matters not because distractions are bad, but because it helped Bill Gates create a billion-dollar company in less than a semester.
