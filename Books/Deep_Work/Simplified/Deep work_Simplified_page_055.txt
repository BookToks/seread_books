The second important idea here is that getting really good at a skill takes serious effort and focus. (Remember from Chapter 1 that deep work is needed to improve skills and use them at a high level—this is what crafting your skill is all about.) Deep work is the key to finding meaning in your job, like Dreyfus and Kelly explained. So, if you choose to focus deeply on your career and skill-building, it can change a boring, tiring job into something satisfying and full of amazing things.

The first two chapters of Part 1 were practical. They said that deep work is becoming more valuable in today’s economy but also harder to find (for some random reasons). This is a classic problem: if you learn to do deep work well, you’ll do great in your career.

This last chapter is different. It doesn’t add much advice about getting ahead at work, but it’s still very important for the ideas before to make sense. The next pages explain a tough plan for changing your work life to focus on depth. This change is hard, and good reasons can only push you so far. At some point, your goal has to feel meaningful on a personal level.

This chapter says that when it comes to going deep, feeling that personal connection is guaranteed. Whether you look at it through brain science, psychology, or big ideas, they all show that depth is connected to meaning. It’s like humans have evolved to thrive in deep thinking and struggle with shallow thinking, almost like a new kind of human called Homo sapiens deepensis.

I shared a quote from Winifred Gallagher, a big fan of deep work, who said, “I’ll live the focused life, because it’s the best kind there is.” This sums up this chapter and Part 1: living deeply is living well, no matter how you see it.
