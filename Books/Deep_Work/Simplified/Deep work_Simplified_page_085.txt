This idea says you should copy Kreider by giving yourself regular and big breaks from work stuff during your day. These breaks actually help you do your best, focused work later. There are lots of ways to do this. For example, Kreider suggests getting away from all the small tasks by hiding out somewhere no one knows about, but most people can’t do that. So, I have a better idea that still works well: At the end of your workday, stop thinking about work until the next morning. Don’t check emails after dinner, don’t keep replaying work talks in your head, and don’t plan how to solve problems. Just stop work thoughts completely. If you need more time, then work longer, but once you stop, let your mind relax and notice simple things around you like flowers, bugs, and stars.

Before sharing some tips to help with this idea, I want to explain why stopping work thinking helps you do better work. Of course, Tim Kreider says it works, but it’s also good to know the science behind why downtime is valuable. Research shows three reasons why downtime helps.

Reason #1: Downtime Helps You Get New Ideas. A study from 2006 in the journal Science talked about how people usually think working hard on decisions is best. But the researchers asked if that’s really true.

Hidden in that question is a surprising idea. The study, led by Dutch psychologist Ap Dijksterhuis, tried to prove that some decisions are actually better if your unconscious mind figures them out. This means it’s worse to think too hard about a decision. Instead, you should learn the facts, then do something else and let your brain work on it in the background.

To test this, Dijksterhuis’s team gave people information to help choose a car. Half the people had to think carefully and then choose. The other half were distracted with easy puzzles after reading the info, then had to pick quickly without thinking much. The distracted group made better choices.
