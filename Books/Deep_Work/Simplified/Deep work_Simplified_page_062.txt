Email is great for people who need to stay on top of many things. But that’s not me. My job requires long hours of studying and focusing without interruptions.

Knuth says he doesn’t want to cut himself off from the world completely. Writing his books means he needs to talk to lots of people and answer their questions.

His solution? He gives a mailing address. His assistant sorts the letters and keeps the important ones. If something is really urgent, she shows it to Knuth quickly. Otherwise, he deals with the letters all at once every few months.

Knuth follows what I call the monastic deep work style. This means focusing deeply on important work and cutting out distractions. People who use this method usually have one clear goal, and they get really good at it. This focus helps them avoid getting caught up in small, less important tasks.

Knuth’s goal is to learn parts of computer science deeply and then explain them in a way that’s easy to understand. Trying to convince him to use Twitter or email more won’t work because those things don’t help him reach his goal.

Another example is Neal Stephenson, a famous science fiction writer. On his website, he doesn’t list an email or mailing address. In essays from the early 2000s, he said he doesn’t answer email because it interrupts his focus. He explained that all his time and attention are already fully booked.
