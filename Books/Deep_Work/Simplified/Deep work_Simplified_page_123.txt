Don’t Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself

Arnold Bennett was an English writer who lived around the early 1900s. At that time, England’s economy was going through big changes. The industrial revolution had been going on for a long time and created a new kind of job: office work. People could now work set hours in an office and earn a steady salary to support their family. Today, this way of life seems normal, but back then, it was new and sometimes stressful. Bennett worried that people with these jobs were missing out on chances to live better lives.

He gives an example of a London office worker who works from ten in the morning to six in the evening and spends about fifty minutes traveling to and from work. This person has about sixteen hours left each day after work. Bennett thinks that’s a lot of time, but most people don’t use it well. They treat their work hours as “the day” and see the rest of the time as unimportant or just something before and after work. Bennett says this way of thinking is “illogical and unhealthy.” Instead, he says people should think of their free time as a “day within a day.” During those sixteen hours, they should act like someone who doesn’t have to worry about money and use the time for self-improvement, especially by reading good books and poetry.

Bennett wrote about this more than 100 years ago. You might think that since then, with so many more people working office jobs, we would have changed how we think about free time. But we haven’t. In fact, with the Internet and easy access to simple, low-quality entertainment, many people today, especially Millennials who know a lot about technology, spend their free time mostly clicking through boring or distracting digital content instead of improving themselves.
