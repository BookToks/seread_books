• Re: Fwd: Study Hacks. This email was part of a chat where I was trying to find a time to meet someone I know who was visiting my city — which was hard because their schedule was all over the place.

• Re: just curious. This message was part of a talk between me and a coworker about some tricky office drama (the kind that happens a lot in schools and universities).

These emails show the kind of small problems that take up your time when you do knowledge work. Some issues are harmless, like talking about a cool article. Others are a bit stressful, like chatting about saving money for retirement (which usually ends with you not doing the right things). Some are annoying, like trying to plan a meeting when everyone is busy. And some are clearly bad, like angry replies to scammers or worried talks about office drama.

Many people who work with ideas spend most of their day dealing with these small problems. Even when they have to do something more important, checking emails a lot keeps these little things on their mind. Gallagher says this is a bad way to work because it makes your brain focus on stress, frustration, and unimportant stuff. In other words, your inbox shows you a world that isn’t very nice to be in.

Even if your coworkers are nice and your talks are positive, paying too much attention to these small things can trick your brain. Gallagher says, “When you lose focus, your mind usually thinks about what’s wrong in your life, not what’s right.” So, a workday filled with these small distractions can make you feel tired and upset, even if the things seem harmless or fun.

The lesson is clear. At work (especially when you do knowledge work), spending more time really focusing means using your brain in a way that makes your work feel more meaningful and rewarding. After going through a tough cancer experience, Gallagher says she now has a plan for how to live the rest of her life.
