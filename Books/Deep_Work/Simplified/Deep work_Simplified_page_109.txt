In the fall of 2013, I learned something interesting after writing an article about why I never joined Facebook. Even though my article just explained my reasons and didn’t blame anyone, a lot of readers got defensive and wrote back to explain why they use Facebook. Here are some examples they gave:  
• “I use Facebook for fun. I like seeing what my friends are doing and posting funny pictures or quick comments.”  
• “When I first joined, I wasn’t sure why. I was just curious, so I joined a group for short stories. I got better at writing and made some good friends.”  
• “I use Facebook because many people I knew in high school are on it.”  

What surprised me about these answers (which were similar to many others I got) is that they seemed pretty small. For example, I believe the first person enjoys Facebook, but I doubt they had nothing else to do before joining. I think they would still find ways to have fun even if Facebook disappeared. Facebook just gave them one more (maybe not the best) way to entertain themselves.  

Another person said they made friends in a writing group. I believe those friends exist, but these are probably light friendships because they’re mostly just short messages online. There’s nothing wrong with that, but these friendships probably aren’t a big part of that person’s social life. The person who reconnected with high school friends is similar. It’s a nice thing, but not something that really makes them happy or connected all the time.  

I’m not saying these benefits don’t matter—what people said is real and helpful. But I want to point out that these benefits are small and kind of random. If you asked someone why they use the internet or email, they’d have stronger and clearer reasons. You might say, “Any benefit is good, so why not use Facebook if it helps a little?” I call this the any-benefit mindset because it thinks that even a tiny good thing is enough reason to use something online.
