Here’s the deal: The Any-Benefit Approach to picking network tools means you’re okay using a tool if it might help you in any way or if you think you might lose out by not using it.

The problem with this way of thinking is that it ignores the bad stuff that comes with these tools. They’re made to be addictive — stealing your time and focus from things that really help your goals, like deep work. If you use these tools too much, you might end up burned out and super distracted, like Baratunde Thurston and many others. This shows why the any-benefit mindset is dangerous. Using network tools can actually hurt you. If you only look for any small benefit and ignore the downsides, you could mess up your chances of doing well in knowledge work.

If you think about it, this shouldn’t be surprising. We’re used to the any-benefit way when it comes to network tools, but if you step back and look at it like skilled workers do with their tools, it seems weird. Once you stop thinking about the internet as some big revolution where you’re either all in or totally against it, you’ll see that network tools are just tools. They’re no different from a blacksmith’s hammer or an artist’s brush—things skilled people use to do their jobs better or sometimes just for fun.

Throughout history, skilled workers have been smart and careful about new tools before deciding to use them.

There’s no reason why people working with knowledge can’t do the same with the internet—it’s still just a tool, even though it deals with digital stuff.

To understand how to choose tools more carefully, it helps to talk to someone who works with regular tools every day and depends on them to succeed. Luckily, I found someone like that: Forrest Pritchard, a skinny English major who became a successful sustainable farmer.

Forrest runs Smith Meadows, a family farm about an hour west of D.C., in the Blue Ridge Mountains. After taking over from his parents, he changed the farm from growing just one type of crop to focusing on grass-finished meat, which was a new idea back then.
