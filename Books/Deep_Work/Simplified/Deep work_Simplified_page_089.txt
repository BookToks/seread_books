By the evening, you’re usually too tired to do deep, focused work. Any work you try to do at night won’t really help your career much. Instead, you’ll probably end up doing easy tasks slowly and with low energy. So, working in the evening isn’t very important or useful.

Because of this, it’s a good idea to have a clear time when you stop working each day. Now, let’s talk about how to make this work for you.

First, you have to promise yourself that once your workday ends, you won’t let any work thoughts sneak in. This means no checking emails or looking at work websites. Even a quick peek can distract you for a long time. For example, seeing a stressful email on a Saturday morning can ruin your whole weekend because you keep thinking about it.

Another important part of this plan is to create a “shutdown ritual” at the end of your workday. This ritual helps you finish strong and stop thinking about work. You should check all your unfinished tasks and make sure you have a plan to finish them later or that they’re saved somewhere safe to look at later. Do this step-by-step every day. When you finish, say a little phrase like “Shutdown complete” to tell your brain it’s time to relax. It might sound silly, but it really helps.

To explain better, here’s how I do my shutdown ritual. First, I check my email one last time to make sure nothing urgent needs answering. Then, I move any new tasks I thought of or wrote down during the day into my main task list. I use Google Docs for this because I can get to it from any computer, but you can use whatever works for you. After that, I quickly look over all my tasks and check my calendar for the next few days.
