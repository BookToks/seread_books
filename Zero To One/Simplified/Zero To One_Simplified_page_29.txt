Perfect balance might describe most of the universe and even some businesses. But every new idea happens far from that balance. In the real world, a business only succeeds if it does something that others can’t do. So, having a monopoly isn’t a bad thing or an exception. It’s actually how every successful business works.

Tolstoy starts his book, *Anna Karenina*, by saying, “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” Business is different. All successful companies are unique: each one finds a special problem to solve. All failed companies are the same: they couldn’t get away from the competition.
