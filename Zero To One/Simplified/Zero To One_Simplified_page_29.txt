Perfect balance might describe most of the universe and even some businesses. But every new idea or product happens when things are not balanced. In the real world, a business only succeeds if it does something that others can't. So, having a monopoly isn't a bad thing or a rare case. It's actually what every successful business has.

Tolstoy starts his book, *Anna Karenina*, by saying, “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” Business works differently. All successful companies are unique: they create a monopoly by solving a special problem. On the other hand, all failed companies have one thing in common: they couldn't stand out from the competition.
