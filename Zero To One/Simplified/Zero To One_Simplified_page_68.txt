WHAT TO DO WITH THE POWER LAW

The power law is super important, not just for investors but for everyone because everyone is an investor in some way. When someone starts a business, they invest a lot of their time and energy into it. So, every entrepreneur needs to think about whether their company will succeed and become valuable. Even you, when you choose a career, are betting that the work you do will matter in the future.

Most people say the best way to prepare for the future is to have a diverse portfolio. You’ve probably heard the saying, “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” Even the best investors have a mix of investments, but those who really get the power law tend to make fewer investments. The common idea is that spreading your bets is smart because it protects you from uncertainty. 

But life isn’t like a portfolio. A startup founder can’t just spread themselves thin by trying to run many companies at once and hope one will succeed. Similarly, you can’t just keep a bunch of different career options on standby and think that’s a good plan.

Schools often teach the opposite. Education usually gives everyone the same kind of knowledge. In American schools, every class is the same length, and all students move at the same speed. In college, many students try to cover all their bases by learning lots of small skills. Universities focus on “excellence,” and their long course lists make it seem like it doesn’t matter what you study, as long as you do it well. That’s not true. What you choose to do really matters. You should focus on what you’re good at, but first, you need to think about whether it will be valuable in the future.

In the startup world, this means you might not need to start your own company, even if you’re really talented. In fact, too many people are starting their own businesses these days. Those who understand the power law think twice before launching a new venture because they know they could be much more successful by joining a top company while it’s growing. The power law shows that the differences between companies are way bigger than the differences in jobs within those companies. You could own 100% of your own failing business, but that means you have nothing. On the other hand, owning just a tiny piece of a successful company like Google can be worth millions.

If you do decide to start your own company, keep the power law in mind to run it well. There’s usually one market that’s better than all the others, and one distribution strategy that works best. Time and decision-making also follow the power law, meaning some moments are way more important than others. But you can’t rely on a world that ignores the power law to help you make decisions, so what’s most important isn’t always clear. It might even be a secret. In a world influenced by the power law, you really need to think carefully about where your actions will fit in.
