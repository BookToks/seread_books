THE FOUNDER’S PARADOX

Out of the six people who started PayPal, four of them had built bombs when they were in high school. Five of them were only 23 years old or younger. Four of us were born outside the United States. Three of us had come here from countries with communist governments: Yu Pan from China, Luke Nosek from Poland, and Max Levchin from Soviet Ukraine. Building bombs wasn’t something kids usually did in those places back then.

The six of us might have seemed a bit strange. My first chat with Luke was about how he wanted to sign up for cryonics, which means he wanted to be frozen when he died, hoping to come back to life later. Max said he didn’t belong to any country and was proud of it because his family got stuck in a weird situation when the USSR fell apart while they were trying to escape to the U.S. Russ Simmons went from living in a trailer park to a top math and science school in Illinois. Only Ken Howery was like the typical American kid: he was the only Eagle Scout in PayPal. But even Ken’s friends thought he was nuts for joining us and taking a salary that was a third of what he could have made at a big bank. So, he wasn’t completely normal either.

Are all founders weird people? Or do we just remember the weird stuff about them more? The bigger question is, what personal traits really matter for a founder? This chapter talks about why it can be more powerful but also riskier for a company to be led by someone unique instead of just a regular manager.
