THE FOUNDER’S PARADOX

Out of the six people who started PayPal, four had built bombs in high school. Five of them were only 23 years old or younger. Four of us were born outside the U.S. Three of us came from countries with communism: Yu Pan from China, Luke Nosek from Poland, and Max Levchin from Soviet Ukraine. Building bombs wasn’t something kids usually did in those places back then.

We could have seemed a bit strange to others. My first chat with Luke was about how he signed up for cryonics, which means he wanted to be frozen when he died, hoping to come back to life later. Max said he had no country and was proud of it because his family got stuck in a tough situation when the USSR fell apart while they were trying to escape to the U.S. Russ Simmons went from living in a trailer park to a top math and science school in Illinois. Only Ken Howery seemed like a typical American kid: he was the only Eagle Scout in the group. But even Ken’s friends thought he was weird for choosing to work with us for a much lower salary than what a big bank offered him.

Are all founders kind of odd? Or do we just remember the weird things about them? More importantly, what traits really matter for a founder? This chapter talks about why having a unique leader can be more powerful but also riskier for a company than just having a regular manager.
