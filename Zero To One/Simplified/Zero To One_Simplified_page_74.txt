HOW TO VIEW THE WORLD WITHOUT SECRETS

What would the world be like if we didn’t believe in secrets? You’d think we’ve figured out all the big questions. If what we believe today is true, we could feel pretty confident: “Everything is fine in the world.”

For example, in a world without secrets, everyone would understand what justice really means. Every unfair situation hides a truth that most people don’t see right away. In a democratic society, something wrong keeps happening only when most people don’t see it as unfair. A long time ago, only a few people knew that slavery was wrong; now we all agree, but back in the early 1800s, it was still a secret. If we say there are no secrets today, it means we live in a world without hidden unfairness.

In economics, not believing in secrets makes people trust that markets work well. But financial bubbles show that markets can be really messed up. The more people believe in how efficient markets are, the bigger those bubbles become. In 1999, no one wanted to believe that the internet was way overpriced. The same thing happened with housing in 2005. The head of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, noticed some issues but still thought a big housing bubble wasn’t likely. People believed the market was perfect, but then home prices dropped, leading to the 2008 financial crisis, which lost trillions of dollars. It turned out there were many secrets that economists couldn’t just ignore.

What happens when a company stops believing in secrets? The story of Hewlett-Packard (HP) is a warning. In 1990, HP was worth $9 billion. Then, in the 1990s, they created amazing products. In 1991, they launched the DeskJet 500C, the first affordable color printer. In 1993, they released the OmniBook, one of the first super-portable laptops. The next year, they came out with the OfficeJet, the first all-in-one printer, fax, and copier. This nonstop innovation paid off, and by 2000, HP was worth $135 billion.

But starting in late 1999, when HP began a new campaign to “invent,” they stopped actually inventing. In 2001, they launched HP Services, which was just a consulting and support business. In 2002, they merged with Compaq because they didn’t know what else to do. By 2005, HP’s value dropped to $70 billion, about half of what it had been five years earlier.

HP’s board was a mess, splitting into two groups, with only one caring about new technology. This group was led by Tom Perkins, who had been with HP since 1963 and wanted the board to find new tech ideas and build them. But his group lost to the other side, led by Patricia Dunn, who thought the board should only focus on basic rules and accounting. 

During this fighting, someone on the board leaked info to the press. When it was found out that Dunn had set up illegal wiretaps to find out who leaked the info, it caused even more trouble, and the board was embarrassed. Instead of looking for new tech ideas, HP got caught up in gossip. By late 2012, HP was worth just $23 billion, not much more than it was in 1990 when you adjust for inflation.
