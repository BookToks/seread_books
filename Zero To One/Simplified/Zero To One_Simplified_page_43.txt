BUILDING A MONOPOLY

A monopoly is when one company controls a big part of a market. To build one, you need to pick your market carefully and grow step by step.

Start Small and Monopolize

Every new business starts off small. To become a monopoly, you need to take over a large part of the market. So, it's smart to begin with a really small market. It’s easier to be the best in a small area than in a huge one. If you think your starting market is too big, it probably is.

Starting small doesn’t mean you have to be invisible. We learned this at PayPal. Our first product let people send money to each other using PalmPilots. It was cool tech, but there weren’t enough PalmPilot users in one place, and they didn’t use them often. So, no one wanted our product, and we had no customers.

After that, we focused on eBay auctions, where we found our first success. Back in late 1999, eBay had a few thousand top sellers, and after just three months of hard work, we were helping 25% of them. It was way easier to reach a few thousand people who actually needed our product than to compete with millions of random individuals.

The best market for a new business is a small group of specific people who are close together and have few or no competitors. A big market is usually a bad idea, especially if there are already other companies in it. That’s why it’s a warning sign when entrepreneurs talk about getting just 1% of a $100 billion market. A big market often doesn’t have a good starting point or is too competitive, making it hard to get that 1%. Even if you do manage to get a small piece, you might struggle to make money because of the tough competition.

Scaling Up

Once you take over a small market, you can slowly move into related markets. Amazon is a great example of this. Jeff Bezos wanted to be the best at online shopping, but he started with books. There were tons of books to sell, they were easy to ship, and even the rare ones attracted excited customers. Amazon became the go-to place for people far from bookstores or looking for something special. 

After that, Amazon had two choices: get more people to read books or expand to similar markets. They chose to expand, starting with things like CDs, videos, and software. They kept adding new categories until they became the biggest store for everything. The name “Amazon” reflects this idea. Just like the Amazon rainforest has lots of different plants and animals, Amazon started with books and now sells all kinds of stuff.

eBay also began by focusing on small niche markets. When it launched its auction site, it targeted specific groups of buyers and sellers.
