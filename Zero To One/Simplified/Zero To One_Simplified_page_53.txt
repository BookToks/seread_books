OUR INDEFINITELY OPTIMISTIC WORLD

Indefinite Finance

If we think about a super cool future where we have underwater cities and live in space, we need engineers. But if we look at a future that’s more uncertain, we need more bankers and lawyers. Finance is all about this uncertainty because it’s how people make money even when they don’t know how to create real wealth. Many smart college graduates go to Wall Street because they aren’t sure what to do with their careers. Once they get to places like Goldman Sachs, they realize that even in finance, things are pretty uncertain. It’s still hopeful—you wouldn’t invest if you thought you’d lose money—but the main idea is that the market is random. You can’t really know what will happen, so spreading out your investments becomes super important.

The weirdness of finance can be surprising. Think about what happens when successful business owners sell their companies. What do they do with the money? Here’s how it usually goes:

- The founders don’t know what to do, so they give it to a big bank.
- The bankers don’t know what to do, so they spread it out across different investors.
- Those investors don’t know what to do with their money, so they buy a bunch of stocks.
- Companies try to raise their stock prices by making money. If they succeed, they pay dividends or buy back shares, and then the whole cycle starts again.

At no point does anyone really know how to use that money in the real world. But in this uncertain world, people actually like having endless options; money is seen as more valuable than anything you could do with it. Only in a certain future does money serve a purpose, instead of being the main goal.

Indefinite Politics

Politicians have always had to answer to the public during elections, but now they pay attention to what people think all the time. Modern polling lets politicians change their image to match what people already believe, and that’s mostly what they do. Nate Silver’s election predictions are super accurate, but what’s even more interesting is how much attention they get every four years. We care more about what polls say about how people will think in a few weeks than about big ideas for what the country will look like in 10 or 20 years.

It’s not just about elections—the way the government works has become uncertain too. The government used to handle complicated problems like nuclear weapons and space missions. But now, after 40 years of uncertainty, the government mainly provides insurance. Our solutions to big issues are things like Medicare and Social Security. It’s no surprise that spending on these programs has been more than other types of spending since 1975. To spend more on other things, we would need clear plans to fix specific problems. But because of the uncertain way we think about spending, we can’t really do that.
