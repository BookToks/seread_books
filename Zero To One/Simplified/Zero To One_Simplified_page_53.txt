OUR INDEFINITELY OPTIMISTIC WORLD

Indefinite Finance

If we want a future where we build underwater cities and live in space, we need engineers. But if we’re talking about a future that’s uncertain, we need more bankers and lawyers. Finance is all about uncertainty because it’s how people make money when they don’t really know how to create it. If smart college grads don’t go to law school, they often end up on Wall Street because they don’t have a clear career path. Once they get to places like Goldman Sachs, they realize that even in finance, everything is uncertain. It’s still hopeful—you wouldn’t invest in the markets if you thought you’d lose—but the main idea is that the market is random; you can’t know anything for sure, so spreading out your investments becomes super important.

The uncertainty in finance can be strange. Think about what happens when successful business owners sell their companies. What do they do with the money? In a world focused on finance, it goes like this:

- The founders don’t know what to do with the money, so they give it to a big bank.
- The bankers don’t know what to do with it either, so they spread it out across different investors.
- Those investors don’t know what to do with their money, so they buy a bunch of stocks.
  
Companies try to raise their stock prices by making more money. If they succeed, they pay dividends or buy back shares, and the cycle starts all over again.

At no point does anyone really know what to do with money in the real world. But in an uncertain world, people actually like having endless choices; money is seen as more valuable than anything you could do with it. Only in a certain future does money serve a purpose, instead of being the main goal.

Indefinite Politics

Politicians have always had to answer to the public during elections, but now they pay attention to what people think all the time. Modern polling lets politicians change their image to fit what people already believe, and they mostly do that. Nate Silver’s election predictions are super accurate, but what’s even more surprising is how much attention they get every four years. We care more about what polls say the country will think in a few weeks than about what it will look like in 10 or 20 years.

It’s not just about elections—the whole government has become uncertain too. The government used to handle complicated issues like nuclear weapons and space missions. But now, after 40 years of uncertainty, the government mainly provides insurance; our solutions to big problems are things like Medicare and Social Security. It’s no surprise that spending on these programs has become bigger than other types of spending every year since 1975. To increase other spending, we’d need clear plans to tackle specific issues. But according to the uncertain way of thinking about entitlement spending, we can’t.
