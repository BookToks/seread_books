Indefinite Philosophy

You can see a change in how people think about politics, not just in what politicians say but also in the ideas of political thinkers from both sides. 

In ancient times, philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, and Lucretius had a pretty negative view of human potential. They believed there were strict limits to what people could achieve, and the main question was how to deal with our sad fate. 

But in the 19th century, philosophers became more positive. Thinkers like Herbert Spencer on the right, Hegel in the middle, and Marx on the left believed in progress. They thought that new technology and ideas would make life better for everyone. They were definite optimists.

In the late 20th century, a new kind of thinking emerged. Two important political thinkers, John Rawls and Robert Nozick, had very different views. Rawls, from the left, cared about fairness and how resources are shared. Nozick, from the right, focused on individual freedom. Both believed people could live together peacefully, which made them more optimistic than the ancient philosophers. However, unlike Spencer or Marx, Rawls and Nozick were indefinite optimists—they didn’t have a clear picture of what the future should look like.

Their different ideas showed this indefiniteness. Rawls started his book, A Theory of Justice, with the idea of a “veil of ignorance.” He thought that fair political decisions are hard to make if you know how the world really is. Instead of trying to change our real world with all its unique people and technologies, Rawls imagined a perfect society that was fair but not very dynamic. Nozick disagreed with Rawls’s idea of justice. He believed that any voluntary exchange should be allowed, and no social system could be good enough to justify forcing people to follow it.
