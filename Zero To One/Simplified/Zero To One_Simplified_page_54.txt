Indefinite Philosophy

You can see a change in how people think about politics, not just in government but also in the ideas of political thinkers from both sides.

In ancient times, philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, and Lucretius believed that humans had strict limits. They thought the only thing we could do was figure out how to deal with our sad fate. But modern philosophers have mostly been more positive. Thinkers like Herbert Spencer on the right, Hegel in the middle, and Marx on the left all believed in progress. They thought that new inventions and improvements would really change life for the better. They were definitely optimistic.

In the late 20th century, new ideas started to take over. Two big political thinkers, John Rawls and Robert Nozick, are often seen as complete opposites. Rawls, who was on the left, cared about fairness and how resources should be shared. Nozick, on the right, focused on making sure everyone had as much freedom as possible. They both thought people could live together peacefully, so they were more hopeful than the ancient philosophers. But unlike Spencer or Marx, Rawls and Nozick didn’t have a clear idea of what the future should look like.

Their uncertainty showed in different ways. Rawls started his book, A Theory of Justice, with the idea of a “veil of ignorance.” He believed that fair political decisions are hard to make when you know how the world really is. Instead of trying to change our actual world with real people and technology, Rawls imagined a perfect society that was fair but not very exciting. Nozick disagreed with Rawls’s idea of justice. He thought that any voluntary trade should be allowed, and no social system could be good enough to justify forcing people to stick to it.
