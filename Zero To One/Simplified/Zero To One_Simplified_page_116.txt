THE TIMING QUESTION

Cleantech entrepreneurs really wanted to believe that their moment had finally come. When Andrew Wilson, the CEO of SpectraWatt, announced his new company in 2008, he said that the solar industry was like the microprocessor industry back in the late 1970s. He thought there was a lot to improve, and he was right about that. But comparing the two industries wasn’t accurate at all.

Since the first microprocessor was made in 1970, computers have advanced super quickly. Just look at how fast Intel released their early products. On the other hand, the first silicon solar cell was created by Bell Labs in 1954, which is more than 50 years before Wilson made his announcement. Solar cell efficiency has improved over the years, but it has been a slow process. Bell's first solar cell had about 6% efficiency, and even today, the best solar cells haven’t gone beyond 25% efficiency in real-world use. 

In the mid-2000s, there weren’t many new engineering breakthroughs that suggested the solar market was about to explode. Entering a slow-moving market can be a smart move, but only if you have a clear and realistic plan to succeed. The cleantech companies that failed didn’t have that.
