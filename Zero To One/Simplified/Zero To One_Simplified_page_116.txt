THE TIMING QUESTION

Cleantech entrepreneurs really wanted to believe that their time to shine had come. 

When Andrew Wilson, the CEO of SpectraWatt, announced his new company in 2008, he said that the solar industry was like the microprocessor industry back in the late 1970s. He thought there was a lot to improve and figure out. He was right about needing improvements, but comparing it to microprocessors was not a good idea. 

Since the first microprocessor was made in 1970, technology has advanced super quickly. Just look at Intel's early products. But the first silicon solar cell was made by Bell Labs way back in 1954, which is over 50 years before Wilson made his announcement. Solar cell efficiency has improved over the years, but it has been a slow and steady process. Bell's first solar cell had about 6% efficiency, and even today’s best solar cells haven’t gone over 25% efficiency in real-world use. 

In the mid-2000s, there weren’t many new engineering breakthroughs that suggested the solar market was about to take off. Entering a slow-moving market can be a smart move, but only if you have a clear and realistic plan to succeed. The cleantech companies that failed didn’t have that plan.
