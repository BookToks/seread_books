In some really intense groups, members only hang out with each other. They ignore their families and the outside world. In return, they feel a strong sense of belonging and might learn special “truths” that regular people don’t know. We call these groups cults. 

From the outside, cults can seem really weird, especially since some famous ones, like those led by Jim Jones and Charles Manson, ended badly. But entrepreneurs should pay attention to these super dedicated cultures. Is being just okay with your job a sign of being healthy? Is having a professional attitude the only smart way to be? 

On the other hand, you have consulting firms like Accenture. They don’t really have a strong mission, and their consultants come and go from companies without any long-term ties. 

You can think of company cultures on a scale. The best startups are like less extreme versions of cults. The main difference is that cults often believe something really wrong, while people at successful startups are usually right about something that others don’t see. You won’t find those kinds of secrets from consultants, and it’s okay if your company doesn’t make sense to traditional professionals. It’s better to be called a cult—or even a mafia.
