In some really intense groups, members only hang out with each other. They ignore their families and the outside world. In return, they feel a strong sense of belonging and might learn special “truths” that regular people don’t know. We call these groups cults. From the outside, they can seem really strange, especially since some famous cults were dangerous, like Jim Jones and Charles Manson, who had really bad endings.

But entrepreneurs should pay attention to these extreme dedication cultures. Is it healthy to just be okay with your job? Is being just professional the best way to think? The opposite of a cult is a consulting firm like Accenture. These firms don’t have a strong mission, and their consultants often move in and out of different companies without any long-term ties.

You can think of company cultures on a line. The best startups are like less extreme versions of cults. The main difference is that cults usually believe something wrong about something important. People at a successful startup are really passionate about something that others don’t see. You won’t learn those secrets from consultants, and it’s okay if your company doesn’t make sense to traditional professionals. It’s better to be seen as a cult—or even a mafia.
