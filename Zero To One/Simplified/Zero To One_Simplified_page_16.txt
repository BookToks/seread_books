The euro started in January 1999, but many people were unsure about it. On its first day, it was worth $1.19, but then it dropped to $0.83 in just two years. By mid-2000, the G7 central bankers had to step in and spend a lot of money to keep it from failing.

During this time, there was a short period of excitement about internet companies, known as the dot-com mania, which began in September 1998. The old ways of doing business were struggling with the challenges of globalization. People felt that something had to succeed big time for the future to look better. The new internet economy seemed to be the only way to move forward.
