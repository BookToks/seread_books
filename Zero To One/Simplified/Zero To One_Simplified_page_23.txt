LIES PEOPLE TELL

How much of the business world is really controlled by one company? How much is actually competitive? It’s tough to tell because people often mix up these ideas. To someone looking in from the outside, all businesses might seem pretty similar, so it’s easy to think there are only small differences between them. But the truth is much clearer. There’s a big difference between a monopoly and a competitive market, and most businesses are closer to one side than we usually think.

The confusion comes from how people talk about market conditions to make themselves look better. Both monopolies and competitors have reasons to twist the truth.

Monopoly Lies

Monopolies lie to protect their interests. They know that bragging about being the best can lead to investigations and criticism. Since they want to keep making money without being bothered, they usually try to hide their monopoly by claiming there’s more competition than there really is.

Take Google, for example. It doesn’t say it’s a monopoly, but is it? It depends on how you look at it. If we see Google mainly as a search engine, it controls about 68% of the search market as of May 2014. Its closest competitors, Microsoft and Yahoo!, have only about 19% and 10%. If that doesn’t sound powerful enough, remember that “google” is now a word in the Oxford English Dictionary, meaning to search online. You won’t see that happening with Bing anytime soon.

But if we think of Google as an advertising company, the picture changes. The U.S. search engine advertising market is worth $17 billion every year. Online advertising is $37 billion a year. The whole U.S. advertising market is $150 billion, and globally, it’s a massive $495 billion. So even if Google completely controlled U.S. search engine advertising, it would only own about 3.4% of the global advertising market. From this view, Google seems like a small player in a competitive field.
