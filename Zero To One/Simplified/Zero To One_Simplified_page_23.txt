LIES PEOPLE TELL

How much of the business world is really controlled by one company? How much is actually competitive? It’s tough to tell because people often mix up these ideas. To someone looking in from the outside, all businesses might seem pretty similar, making it easy to see only tiny differences between them. But the truth is way clearer than that. There’s a big gap between perfect competition and a monopoly, and most businesses are closer to one of those extremes than we usually think.

The confusion comes from how people talk about the market. Both monopolies and competitive businesses have reasons to twist the truth to their advantage.

Monopoly Lies

Monopolies lie to keep their power. They know that bragging about being the best can lead to investigations and problems. Since they want to keep making money without interruptions, they try to hide their monopoly by pretending there’s a lot of competition that isn’t really there.

Take Google, for example. It doesn’t say it’s a monopoly, but is it? It depends on what you’re looking at. If we think of Google mainly as a search engine, it owned about 68% of the search market as of May 2014. Its closest rivals, Microsoft and Yahoo!, had about 19% and 10%, respectively. If that doesn’t sound like enough power, remember that “google” is now a word in the Oxford English Dictionary, used as a verb. You probably won’t see that happening with Bing anytime soon.

But if we look at Google as an advertising company, things change. The U.S. search engine advertising market is worth $17 billion each year. Online advertising is worth $37 billion a year. The whole U.S. advertising market is $150 billion, and globally, it’s a $495 billion market. So even if Google completely controlled U.S. search engine advertising, it would only have about 3.4% of the global advertising market. From this view, Google seems like a small player in a competitive space.
