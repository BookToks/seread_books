ENERGY 2.0

Tesla's success shows that clean technology (cleantech) isn't a bad idea. The main point is clear: the world needs new energy sources. Energy is super important because it helps us eat, build homes, and create everything we need to live well. Many people around the world want to live as comfortably as Americans do now, but without new technology, we will face serious energy problems as the world gets more connected. There just aren’t enough resources to keep doing things the old way or to share what we have to make everyone rich.

Cleantech gave people hope for the future of energy. But when investors got overly excited about green energy and funded cleantech companies without solid plans, it created a bubble. If you look at how alternative energy companies were valued in the 2000s, it looks a lot like the rise and fall of the NASDAQ a decade earlier. In the 1990s, everyone thought the internet was going to be huge, but too many internet companies had the same idea without anything else to offer. An entrepreneur needs to start with a specific plan, not just a big idea.

Cleantech companies had the same issue: even though the world needs energy, only companies that provide a better solution for a specific energy problem can make money. No industry is so important that just being part of it will make a company great.

The tech bubble was much bigger than cleantech, and the crash hurt even more. But the dream of the '90s turned out to be right: people who doubted the internet would change things looked smart in 2001, but now they seem silly. Could new energy startups be created after the cleantech crash, just like Web 2.0 startups emerged after the dot-com bubble burst? The need for energy solutions is still real. But to succeed, a business needs to start small and own a specific market.

Facebook began as a service for one university before expanding to other schools and then the whole world. Finding small markets for energy solutions will be tough—you might try to replace diesel on remote islands or create quick-to-deploy reactors for military bases in tough areas. Ironically, the challenge for the entrepreneurs who will create Energy 2.0 is to think small.
