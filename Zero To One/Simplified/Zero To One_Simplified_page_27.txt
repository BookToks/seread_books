RUTHLESS PEOPLE

Running a restaurant in a competitive area like Mountain View is tough. You have to work hard to stay in business because there are many other places like yours. If you want to keep prices low, you might only be able to pay your workers minimum wage. To save money, small restaurants often have family members helping out, like Grandma at the cash register and kids washing dishes.

Even the fancy restaurants face a lot of pressure. They get judged by ratings like Michelin stars, which can make chefs really stressed. For example, a famous chef named Bernard Loiseau once said that losing a star would make him want to end his life. Even though he kept his star, he sadly took his own life in 2003 after a different guide rated his restaurant lower. This shows how cutthroat the restaurant business can be.

On the other hand, companies like Google don’t have to worry about competition as much. This gives them the chance to care about their workers and the world around them. Their motto, “Don’t be evil,” is partly a marketing strategy, but it also shows that they can focus on being ethical because they’re doing well financially. In business, money can be really important, but for monopolies, it’s not everything. Businesses that have to compete are so focused on making money right now that they can’t think about the future. The only way to escape this struggle is to make a lot of money, like a monopoly does.
