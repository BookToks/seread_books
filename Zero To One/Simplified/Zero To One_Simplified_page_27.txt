RUTHLESS PEOPLE

Running a restaurant in a competitive area like Mountain View is tough. There are lots of other places to eat, so you have to work hard to stay open. If you want to keep prices low, you can only pay your workers the minimum wage. That’s why small restaurants often have family members helping out, like Grandma at the cash register and kids washing dishes.

Even the best restaurants face a lot of pressure. They want to get high ratings, like Michelin stars, which can make chefs really stressed. For example, a famous chef named Bernard Loiseau once said he would rather die than lose a star. He did keep his star, but sadly, he took his own life in 2003 after another guide gave his restaurant a lower rating. The competition in the restaurant business can push people to their limits.

On the other hand, companies like Google don’t have to worry about competing with anyone else. This gives them more freedom to care about their employees, their products, and how they affect the world. Google’s motto, “Don’t be evil,” is partly for marketing, but it also shows that they can think about ethics because they’re doing well financially. 

In business, money can be everything or just really important. Companies that have a monopoly, like Google, can focus on more than just making money, while other businesses can’t. When a company is in a highly competitive market, it’s so busy trying to make money today that it can’t plan for the future. The only way a business can look beyond daily struggles is if it makes a lot of money from being a monopoly.
