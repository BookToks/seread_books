People hoped for a future where they would work only four days a week, energy would be super cheap, and vacations could be on the moon. But that didn’t happen. 

Today, smartphones keep us busy and make us forget how old some things around us are. Since the 1950s, only computers and communication have really changed a lot. This doesn’t mean our parents were wrong to dream of a better future; they just thought it would happen automatically. 

Now, it’s up to us to imagine and create new technologies that can make this century better and more peaceful than the last one.
