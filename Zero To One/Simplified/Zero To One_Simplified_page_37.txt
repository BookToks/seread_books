LAST MOVER ADVANTAGE

Escaping competition can give you a monopoly, but even having a monopoly is only good if it lasts. Think about the New York Times and Twitter. Both have a few thousand employees and help millions of people get news. But when Twitter went public in 2013, it was valued at $24 billion—more than 12 times what the Times was worth—despite the Times making $133 million in 2012 while Twitter was losing money. Why was Twitter worth so much more?

The answer is cash flow. This might sound strange since the Times was making money while Twitter wasn’t. But a great business is really about how much money it can make in the future. Investors believe Twitter will make a lot of money over the next ten years, while the days of newspapers making big profits are over.

Simply put, the value of a business today is based on all the money it will make in the future. To figure out how much a business is worth, you also need to consider that money today is worth more than the same amount in the future.

Looking at cash flows shows a big difference between slow-growing businesses and fast-growing startups. Most of a low-growth business's value comes from the short term. An old-school business like a newspaper might keep its value if it can keep making money for five or six years. But any business that has close competitors will see its profits drop.

Nightclubs or restaurants are good examples: a successful one might make a lot of money now, but that cash flow will likely go down as customers look for newer, trendier places. On the other hand, tech companies often lose money at first because it takes time to create valuable products, which means they won’t make money right away. Most of a tech company’s value will come at least 10 to 15 years down the line.
