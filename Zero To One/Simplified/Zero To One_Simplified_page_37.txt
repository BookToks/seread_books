LAST MOVER ADVANTAGE

Escaping competition can give you a monopoly, but even a monopoly is only good if it lasts. Look at the New York Times Company and Twitter. Both have a few thousand employees and provide news to millions. When Twitter went public in 2013, it was valued at $24 billion, which is over 12 times more than the Times's value, even though the Times made $133 million in 2012 while Twitter was losing money. Why was Twitter worth so much more?

The answer is cash flow. This might seem strange since the Times was making money and Twitter wasn't. But a great business is really about how much money it can make in the future. Investors believe Twitter will be able to make a lot of money over the next ten years, while newspapers are losing their edge.

Simply put, the value of a business today is based on all the money it will make in the future. To figure out how much a business is worth, you also need to adjust those future earnings to what they are worth today because money now is more valuable than the same amount later.

When you compare future cash flows, you can see the big difference between slow-growing businesses and fast-growing startups. Most of the value in slow-growing businesses comes from the short term. For example, an old-school business like a newspaper might keep its value if it can keep making money for five or six years. But any business with similar options will see its profits go down.

Nightclubs or restaurants are extreme examples: successful ones might make good money now, but their profits will likely drop in a few years when customers find newer and trendier places.

Technology companies are different. They often lose money at first because it takes time to create valuable products, which means they won't earn money right away. Most of a tech company's value will come at least 10 to 15 years down the line.
