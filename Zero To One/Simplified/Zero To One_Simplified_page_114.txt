7.  
The Secret Question  
Have you found a special opportunity that others haven’t noticed?  

We’ve talked about these important points before. No matter what kind of business you want to start, a solid plan must answer all of these questions. If you can’t answer them well, you might face a lot of “bad luck” and your business could fail. If you get all seven right, you’ll have a better chance of succeeding. Even getting five or six of them right might work too. But what was surprising about the cleantech bubble was that many people started companies without good answers to these questions, which meant they were just hoping for a miracle.  

It’s tough to figure out exactly why many cleantech companies failed because most of them made several big mistakes. But since even one mistake can ruin your business, it’s important to look closely at what went wrong in cleantech.
