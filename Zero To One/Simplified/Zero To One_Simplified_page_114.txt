The Secret Question  
Have you found a special opportunity that others don’t see?  

We’ve talked about these points before. No matter what business you’re in, a good plan needs to answer all of them. If you can’t answer these questions well, you might face a lot of “bad luck” and your business could fail. If you get all seven right, you’ll have a better chance of succeeding. Even getting five or six right could work. But what was surprising about the cleantech bubble was that people were starting companies without good answers to these questions, which meant they were just hoping for a miracle.
