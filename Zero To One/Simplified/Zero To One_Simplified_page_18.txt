PAYPAL MANIA

When I was in charge of PayPal in late 1999, I was really scared—not because I didn’t believe in what we were doing, but because everyone else around us seemed to believe in anything. Everywhere I looked, people were starting and selling companies like it was no big deal. One guy I knew even planned to take his company public from his living room before he had even set it up, and he thought that was normal. In this crazy environment, being sensible felt strange.

At least PayPal had a big goal that some people later thought was unrealistic: we wanted to create a new online currency to replace the U.S. dollar. Our first product let people send money from one PalmPilot to another. But nobody really wanted that product except for journalists, who called it one of the 10 worst business ideas of 1999. PalmPilots were still pretty rare, but email was already popular, so we decided to make a way to send and receive payments through email.

By fall 1999, our email payment system worked well—anyone could log onto our website and easily send money. But we didn’t have enough customers, growth was slow, and our costs were piling up. For PayPal to succeed, we needed at least a million users. Advertising wasn’t working well enough to cover the costs. Deals with big banks kept falling through. So, we decided to pay people to sign up.

We offered new customers $10 just for joining, and another $10 for every friend they referred. This helped us get hundreds of thousands of new customers and our growth really took off. But paying people to become customers wasn’t a long-term plan—when you pay people to join, your costs grow quickly. Huge costs were normal back then in Silicon Valley. But we thought our costs made sense: with a lot of users, PayPal could make money by charging a small fee on transactions.

We knew we needed more money to reach our goals. We also realized that the good times wouldn’t last forever. Since we didn’t think investors would keep believing in us after the bubble burst, we rushed to raise funds while we could. On February 16, 2000, the Wall Street Journal wrote an article praising our rapid growth and saying PayPal was worth $500 million. When we raised $100 million the next month, our main investor took the Journal’s estimate seriously. 

Some investors were even more eager. A South Korean company sent us $5 million without even negotiating a deal or signing anything. When I tried to give the money back, they wouldn’t tell me where to send it. That March 2000 funding helped us buy the time we needed to make PayPal successful. Just as we finished the deal, the bubble burst.
