STARTUP THINKING

New technology usually comes from new companies called startups. Throughout history, small groups of people with a shared goal have made big changes in politics, science, and business. The main reason for this is that it’s tough to create new things in large organizations, and it’s even harder to do it alone. 

Big companies move slowly, and people in them often avoid taking risks. In the worst companies, it’s more important to look busy than to actually get things done (if this sounds like your job, you might want to leave). On the other hand, a single genius can create amazing art or literature, but they can’t build an entire industry by themselves. Startups work on the idea that you need to collaborate with others to achieve goals, but you also have to keep the team small enough to stay effective.

A startup is basically the biggest group of people you can convince to help create a new future. The most important strength of a new company is its fresh ideas: being small allows for more creative thinking. This book is about the questions you need to ask and answer to succeed in creating new things. It’s not just a guide or a collection of facts; it’s about learning to think differently. Startups must challenge old ideas and rethink how business is done from the ground up.
