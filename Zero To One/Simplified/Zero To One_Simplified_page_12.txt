STARTUP THINKING

New technology usually comes from new businesses called startups. Throughout history, small groups of people with a common goal have made the world better. This includes famous leaders in politics, scientists, and even business innovators. 

The main reason for this is simple: it's tough to create new things in big companies, and it's even harder to do it alone. Big organizations move slowly, and people in them often avoid taking risks. In the worst companies, looking busy is more important for getting ahead than actually doing real work. If this sounds like your job, you might want to leave. 

On the other hand, a single genius can create amazing art or literature, but they can't build an entire industry by themselves. Startups work on the idea that teamwork is essential for getting things done, but they also need to stay small enough to be effective. 

A startup is basically the biggest group of people you can convince to help you create a new future. The greatest strength of a new company is its fresh ideas. Being small allows for more creative thinking. This book is about the questions you need to ask and answer to succeed in creating new things. It's not just a guide or a collection of facts; it's about learning to think differently. That's what startups need to do: challenge old ideas and rethink how business works from the ground up.
