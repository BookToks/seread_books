Take Sir Richard Branson, the billionaire who started the Virgin Group. He’s a natural entrepreneur because he launched his first business when he was just 16. By the time he was 22, he created Virgin Records. 

But some things about him, like his big, wild hair, aren’t exactly natural. You can guess he didn’t just wake up with that hairstyle. Branson has also developed some pretty extreme traits. For example, is kiteboarding with naked supermodels just a fun thing he does, or is it a clever publicity stunt? The media loves to hype him up, calling him things like “The Virgin King,” “The King of PR,” “The King of Branding,” and even “The King of the Desert and Space.” When Virgin Atlantic Airways started serving drinks with ice cubes shaped like his face, he got the nickname “The Ice King.”

So, is Branson just a regular businessman who gets a lot of attention from the media and a good PR team? Or is he a natural at branding, getting noticed because he knows how to work the media? It’s tough to say—maybe he’s a bit of both.
