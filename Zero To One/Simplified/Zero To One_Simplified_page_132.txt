Take Sir Richard Branson, the billionaire who started the Virgin Group. He’s a natural entrepreneur because he started his first business when he was just 16. By 22, he created Virgin Records. But some things about him, like his wild lion’s mane hairstyle, aren’t exactly natural; he probably didn’t just wake up with that look. 

Branson has worked on his crazy image, like kiteboarding with naked supermodels. Is that just for fun, or is it a clever publicity stunt? The media loves him and has given him lots of titles like “The Virgin King,” “The King of PR,” and “The Ice King” after Virgin Atlantic started serving drinks with ice cubes shaped like his face.

So, is Branson just a regular businessman who got lucky with a great PR team, or is he a genius at branding who knows how to get attention? It’s tough to say—maybe he’s a bit of both.
