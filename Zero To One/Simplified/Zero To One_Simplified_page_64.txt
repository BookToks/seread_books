This graph shows the big difference between what people think and what’s really happening. 

At Founders Fund, we see a clear pattern: Facebook was the best investment in our 2005 fund, making more money than all the other investments combined. Palantir, our second-best investment, is also expected to earn more than all the other investments except Facebook. This uneven pattern isn’t just a one-time thing; we see it in all our funds. 

The biggest secret in venture capital is that the top investment in a successful fund usually makes as much or more than the rest of the fund put together. 

This leads to two strange rules for venture capitalists (VCs). First, they should only invest in companies that could make back the entire fund’s value. This is a tough rule because it cuts out most potential investments. Even successful companies usually don’t make that much money. 

The second rule is that since the first rule is so strict, there can’t be any other rules. 

Think about what happens if you ignore the first rule. For example, Andreessen Horowitz invested $250,000 in Instagram in 2010. When Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion just two years later, they made $78 million—a huge return! But it’s still not enough because their fund is $1.5 billion. If they only invested $250,000, they would need to find 19 companies like Instagram just to break even. That’s why investors usually put in a lot more money into companies they believe in. 

VCs need to find a few companies that can grow really big and support them with everything they have. 

Of course, no one can know for sure which companies will succeed, so even the best VC firms have a mix of investments, called a “portfolio.” But every company in a good venture portfolio must have the potential to become very successful. At Founders Fund, we focus on five to seven companies that we believe could become multibillion-dollar businesses. 

When you start thinking about whether a business fits into a safe investment strategy, venture investing can feel like playing the lottery. And once you think you’re playing the lottery, you’re already getting ready to lose.
