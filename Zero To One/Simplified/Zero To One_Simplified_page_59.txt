THE RETURN OF DESIGN

What would it mean to focus on design instead of just luck? Nowadays, “good design” is super important, and everyone, from lazy people to ambitious ones, carefully picks how they look. 

It’s true that every successful entrepreneur is really a designer at heart. If you’ve ever used an iPhone or a sleek MacBook, you’ve experienced Steve Jobs’s passion for making things look and feel perfect. But the biggest lesson we can learn from Jobs isn’t just about how things look. The best thing he created was his business. 

Apple had clear plans for many years to make new products and sell them well. Forget about “minimum viable products”—since he started Apple in 1976, Jobs showed that you can change the world with careful planning, not by just listening to focus groups or copying what others do. 

Long-term planning is often ignored in our world that focuses on quick results. When the first iPod came out in October 2001, experts thought it was just a nice feature for Mac users and wouldn’t matter to anyone else. But Jobs had a bigger vision for the iPod as the start of a new wave of portable devices, even if most people didn’t see it. If you look at the company’s stock chart, you can see how successful this long-term plan was.

The power of planning also explains why it’s hard to put a value on private companies. When a big company tries to buy a successful startup, they usually offer too much or too little. Founders only sell when they don’t have any more clear ideas for their company, which means the buyer probably overpaid. On the other hand, founders with strong plans don’t sell, so the offer wasn’t high enough. 

When Yahoo! wanted to buy Facebook for $1 billion in July 2006, I thought it was worth considering. But Mark Zuckerberg walked into the meeting and said, “Okay, guys, this is just a formality, it shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes. We’re obviously not going to sell.” Mark knew where he wanted to take the company, but Yahoo! didn’t. A business with a solid plan will always be underestimated in a world where people think the future is random.
