THE RETURN OF DESIGN

What would it mean to focus on design instead of just luck? Nowadays, having “good design” is super important, and everyone from lazy people to business types carefully picks how they look. It’s true that every successful entrepreneur is really a designer at heart. If you’ve ever used an iPhone or a sleek MacBook, you’ve experienced Steve Jobs’s obsession with making things look and feel perfect. But the biggest lesson we can learn from Jobs isn’t just about looks. The best thing he created was his business.

Apple had clear, long-term plans to make new products and get them out to people. Forget about just making something that works; since starting Apple in 1976, Jobs showed us that you can really change the world with careful planning, not just by listening to what focus groups say or copying what others do. Long-term planning is often overlooked in our world that focuses on short-term results.

When the first iPod came out in October 2001, many experts thought it was just a cool gadget for Mac users and wouldn’t matter much to anyone else. But Jobs had a vision for the iPod as the start of a new wave of portable devices, even if most people didn’t see it. If you look at Apple’s stock chart, you can see how successful this long-term plan was.

This power of planning also explains why it’s tough to figure out how much private companies are worth. When a big company tries to buy a successful startup, they usually offer too much or too little. Founders only sell when they don’t have any more solid ideas for their company, which means the buyer probably overpaid. On the other hand, founders with strong plans usually don’t sell, meaning the offer wasn’t high enough. For example, when Yahoo! wanted to buy Facebook for $1 billion in July 2006, I thought it was worth considering. But Mark Zuckerberg walked into the meeting and said, “This is just a formality, it won’t take long. We’re not selling.” Mark knew where he wanted to take his company, but Yahoo! didn’t. A business with a solid plan will always be underestimated in a world that thinks the future is random.
