THE DURABILITY QUESTION

Every entrepreneur should think about being the last one to enter their market. This means asking yourself: what will the world look like in 10 or 20 years, and how will my business fit in?

Not many cleantech companies had a good answer to this. Because of that, their failures look very similar. A few months before it went bankrupt in 2011, Evergreen Solar talked about closing one of its U.S. factories. They said that solar manufacturers in China got a lot of help from their government and financial support. Even though Evergreen's production costs were lower than before and cheaper than most Western companies, they were still much higher than their low-cost competitors in China.

In 2012, the complaints about China really took off. Abound Solar, which was backed by the U.S. Department of Energy, blamed “aggressive pricing actions from Chinese solar panel companies” for making it hard for new companies to grow in the current market. When Energy Conversion Devices went bankrupt in February 2012, they didn’t just blame China; they also filed a $950 million lawsuit against three big Chinese solar manufacturers. Later that year, Solyndra’s bankruptcy trustees sued the same companies for trying to take over the market and unfair pricing. But was it really impossible to see that Chinese manufacturers would be tough competition? Cleantech entrepreneurs should have asked: what could stop China from destroying my business? Not having an answer to that should have been a red flag.

Besides missing the competition from China, cleantech companies made wrong assumptions about the energy market. They thought fossil fuels were on their way out, but they didn’t see the rise of fracking coming. In 2000, only 1.7% of America’s natural gas came from fracked shale, but by 2005, it was 4.1%. Still, no one in cleantech took this seriously; they believed renewables were the only future and that fossil fuels couldn’t get cheaper or cleaner. But they did. By 2013, shale gas made up 34% of America’s natural gas, and prices had dropped more than 70% since 2008, which hurt most renewable energy businesses. Fracking might not be a perfect energy solution, but it was enough to take down cleantech companies that didn’t see it coming.
