A great product is important, but it doesn’t always guarantee success. A good sales strategy for businesses usually starts small. A new customer might want to become your biggest client, but they’re not likely to sign a huge deal right away. Once you have some customers who are happy with your product, you can work on getting bigger deals.

Most sales aren’t too complicated. The average deal can be between $10,000 and $100,000, and usually, the CEO doesn’t have to do all the selling. The real challenge is figuring out how a small sales team can get the product to a lot of people.

In 2008, Box had a cool way for companies to store their data safely in the cloud. But not many people knew they needed it because cloud computing was still new. That summer, Blake joined Box as their third salesperson to help change that. He started with small groups of users who had big file-sharing issues and built relationships with more users in each company. In 2009, Blake sold a small Box account to the Stanford Sleep Clinic, which needed a secure way to store research data. Now, Stanford gives every student and faculty member a Box account, and the hospital uses it too. If Box had tried to sell a big deal to the university president right away, they wouldn’t have sold anything. A complicated sales approach would have made them fail, but personal sales helped them become a huge business.

Sometimes, the product itself helps with sales. ZocDoc is a company that helps people find and book doctor appointments online. They charge doctors a few hundred dollars each month to be part of their network. Since their average deal is only a few thousand dollars, they need a lot of salespeople, so they even have a team just for hiring more. Selling to doctors not only makes money but also makes the product better for users. More users attract more doctors, and now over 5 million people use ZocDoc each month. If they can keep adding more doctors, they’ll become a key part of the U.S. healthcare system.

There’s a tricky spot between personal sales, which need salespeople, and traditional advertising, which doesn’t. Imagine you create a software service that helps convenience store owners manage their inventory for about $1,000. There might not be a good way to reach those small businesses. Even if your product is great, how do you get the word out? Advertising could be too broad, or it might not be effective enough. You need personal sales, but at that price, you can’t afford to send someone to talk to every potential customer. This is why many small and medium-sized businesses miss out on tools that larger companies use easily.
