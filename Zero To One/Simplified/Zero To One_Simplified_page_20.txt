1. Take small steps.  
Big dreams can lead to problems, so don’t get too carried away. If someone says they can do something amazing, be careful. People who want to change the world should be more down-to-earth. The best way to move forward is by taking small, steady steps.

2. Stay flexible.  
All businesses should be “lean,” which means they shouldn’t have strict plans. You shouldn’t know exactly what your business will do. Planning too much can be stuck-up and rigid. Instead, try different things, learn from them, and treat starting a business like an experiment.

3. Improve what’s already out there.  
Don’t rush to create something completely new. The best way to know if your business is real is to start with customers who already exist. So, focus on making better versions of products that are already successful.

4. Focus on the product, not just selling.  
If your product needs a lot of ads or salespeople to sell it, it’s probably not good enough. Technology should be about making great products, not just getting them out there. In the past, too much money was wasted on advertising, so the best growth comes from people sharing your product naturally.

These lessons are now common in the startup world. If you ignore them, you might face the same problems that hit technology hard back in 2000. But there are other ideas that might be more accurate:  
1. Taking risks can be better than playing it safe.  
2. Having a bad plan is better than having no plan at all.  
3. Competitive markets can hurt profits.  
4. Sales are just as important as the product.

It’s true that there was a tech bubble. In the late '90s, people were overly confident, thinking they could go from nothing to something big. Many startups talked a big game but didn’t deliver. However, people realized they had to find ways to do more with less. The market peak in March 2000 was crazy, but it also showed people how much new technology we would need for the future, and they believed they could create it.

We still need new technology, and maybe we need some of that bold confidence from 1999 to get there. To build the next wave of companies, we need to let go of the strict rules made after the crash. But that doesn’t mean the opposite ideas are automatically right. You can’t just reject everything the crowd believes. Instead, think about how much of what you know about business comes from reacting to past mistakes. The most unique thing you can do is to think for yourself.
