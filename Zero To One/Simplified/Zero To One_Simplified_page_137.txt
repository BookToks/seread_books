The path to living forever is blocked. Maybe the only way to be a rock star forever is to die young. 

We both admire and criticize tech founders, just like we do with celebrities. Howard Hughes had the most dramatic story of any tech founder in the 20th century. He was born rich, but he cared more about engineering than living in luxury. At just 11 years old, he built Houston’s first radio transmitter. The next year, he created the city’s first motorcycle. By the time he was 30, he had made nine successful movies when Hollywood was just starting to use new technology. But Hughes was even more famous for his work in aviation. He designed, built, and flew his own planes. He set world records for the fastest flights and the quickest trips across the country and around the world.

Hughes was obsessed with flying higher than anyone else. He liked to remind people that he was just a regular guy, not a Greek god—something people say when they want to be compared to gods. His lawyer once said in court that Hughes was “a man to whom you cannot apply the same standards as you can to you and me.” Hughes paid him to say that, and even the judge and jury agreed. When Hughes got the Congressional Gold Medal in 1939 for his aviation achievements, he didn’t even show up to get it. Years later, President Truman found it in the White House and sent it to him.

Hughes’s problems started in 1946 when he had his third and worst plane crash. If he had died then, people would remember him as one of the most impressive Americans ever. But he survived—barely. After that, he became obsessive-compulsive, got addicted to painkillers, and isolated himself for the last 30 years of his life. Hughes had always acted a bit crazy, thinking that fewer people would bother someone who seemed insane. But when his crazy act became his real life, he turned into someone people felt sorry for as much as they admired him.
