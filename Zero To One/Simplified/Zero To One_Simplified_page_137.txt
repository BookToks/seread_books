Blocked the way to living forever. Maybe the only way to be a rock star forever is to die young.

We both admire and criticize tech founders just like we do celebrities. Howard Hughes had one of the most extreme stories of any tech founder in the 20th century. He was born rich but cared more about engineering than living in luxury. He built Houston’s first radio transmitter when he was just 11 years old. The next year, he made the city’s first motorcycle. By the time he was 30, he had produced nine successful movies when Hollywood was just starting to use new technology. But Hughes was even more famous for his work in aviation. He designed, built, and flew his own planes. He set world records for the fastest speeds in the air, the quickest flight across the country, and the fastest trip around the world.

Hughes was obsessed with flying higher than anyone else. He liked to remind people that he was just a regular guy, not a god—something people say when they want to be compared to gods. His lawyer once said in court that Hughes was “a man to whom you cannot apply the same standards as you can to you and me.” Hughes paid him to say that, but the judge and jury didn’t disagree. When Hughes won the Congressional Gold Medal in 1939 for his work in aviation, he didn’t even show up to get it. Years later, President Truman found it in the White House and mailed it to him.

Hughes’s problems started in 1946 when he had his third and worst plane crash. If he had died then, people would have remembered him as one of the coolest and most successful Americans ever. But he survived—barely. He became obsessed with little things, got addicted to painkillers, and shut himself away from everyone for the last 30 years of his life. Hughes had always acted a bit weird, thinking that fewer people would bother him if he seemed crazy. But when his weird act turned into a real crazy life, people felt sorry for him as much as they admired him.
