Tesla is one of the few clean tech companies from the last decade that is still doing really well today. They got a lot of attention for being eco-friendly, but they also answered seven important questions that helped them succeed.

TECHNOLOGY.  
Tesla’s technology is so impressive that other car companies use it. For example, Daimler uses Tesla’s battery packs, Mercedes-Benz uses a Tesla powertrain, and Toyota uses a Tesla motor. Even General Motors has a team that watches what Tesla does next. But Tesla’s biggest achievement isn’t just one part; it’s how they put everything together to make an amazing product. The Tesla Model S sedan is beautifully designed and has been rated higher than any other car ever by Consumer Reports. It was also named Car of the Year by both Motor Trend and Automobile magazines in 2013.

TIMING.  
Back in 2009, many thought the government would keep supporting clean tech because “green jobs” were popular. There was money set aside, and Congress seemed ready to pass laws to help. But while others thought the money would keep coming, Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, saw it as a one-time chance. In January 2010, about a year and a half before a big company called Solyndra failed, Tesla got a $465 million loan from the U.S. Department of Energy. Getting that much money was almost impossible in the mid-2000s, but Tesla took advantage of the moment perfectly.

MONOPOLY.  
Tesla started in a small market for high-end electric sports cars. Since the first Roadster came out in 2008, they sold about 3,000 of them at $109,000 each, which is a lot of money. Starting small helped Tesla do the research needed to create the slightly cheaper Model S, and now they own the luxury electric sedan market too. They sold over 20,000 sedans in 2013 and are ready to grow into bigger markets in the future.

TEAM.  
Tesla’s CEO is both a great engineer and a good salesman, so it makes sense that he has built a strong team. Elon describes his staff like this: “If you’re at Tesla, you’re choosing to be at the equivalent of Special Forces. There’s the regular army, and that’s fine, but if you are working at Tesla, you’re choosing to step up your game.”

DISTRIBUTION.  
Many companies don’t think distribution is important, but Tesla took it seriously and decided to control the whole process. Other car companies like Ford and Hyundai make cars but rely on other people to sell them. Tesla sells and services its cars in its own stores. This approach costs more upfront than using regular dealerships, but it gives Tesla control over how customers experience their brand and saves them money in the long run.

DURABILITY.  
Tesla has a head start and is moving faster than anyone else, which gives them a big advantage.
