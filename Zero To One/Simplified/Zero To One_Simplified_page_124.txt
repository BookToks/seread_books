TESLA: 7 FOR 7

Tesla is one of the few clean technology companies that started last decade and is still doing well today. They did a great job of getting people excited about clean tech, but they also nailed seven important things that helped them succeed.

TECHNOLOGY.  
Tesla’s technology is so impressive that other car companies use it. For example, Daimler uses Tesla’s battery packs, Mercedes-Benz uses a Tesla powertrain, and Toyota uses a Tesla motor. General Motors even created a team to keep an eye on what Tesla does next. But Tesla’s biggest achievement isn’t just one part; it’s how they put everything together into one amazing product. The Tesla Model S sedan looks great from every angle and is rated higher than any other car ever reviewed by Consumer Reports. Plus, both Motor Trend and Automobile magazines named it their 2013 Car of the Year.

TIMING.  
Back in 2009, many people thought the government would keep supporting clean tech. “Green jobs” were a big deal, and there was money set aside for it. Congress even seemed ready to pass a law to help. But while others thought the money would keep coming, Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, saw it as a one-time chance. In January 2010, about a year and a half before a big clean tech company called Solyndra failed and changed the funding situation, Tesla got a $465 million loan from the U.S. Department of Energy. Getting that much money was hard to imagine back then, and it’s still hard to believe today. Tesla took advantage of that perfect moment.

MONOPOLY.  
Tesla started in a small part of the market that they could really own: high-end electric sports cars. Since the first Roadster came out in 2008, Tesla has sold about 3,000 of them, but at $109,000 each, that’s a lot of money. Starting small let Tesla do the research and development needed to create the slightly cheaper Model S, and now they dominate the luxury electric sedan market too. They sold over 20,000 sedans in 2013, and now Tesla is ready to grow into bigger markets in the future.

TEAM.  
Tesla’s CEO is both a great engineer and a good salesman, so it makes sense that he has built a team that excels at both. Elon describes his team like this: “If you’re at Tesla, you’re choosing to be at the equivalent of Special Forces. There’s the regular army, and that’s fine, but if you are working at Tesla, you’re choosing to step up your game.”

DISTRIBUTION.  
Many companies don’t think distribution is important, but Tesla took it seriously and decided to control the whole distribution process. Other car companies, like Ford and Hyundai, make cars but depend on other people to sell them. Tesla sells and services its cars in its own stores. This approach costs more upfront than using traditional dealerships, but it gives Tesla control over how customers experience their brand and saves the company money in the long run.

DURABILITY.  
Tesla has a head start and is moving faster than anyone else, and that combination makes them tough to beat.
