When people see a cute kitten online, they feel happy and quickly share it with their friends. 

At PayPal, we started with just 24 people who worked there. Getting new customers through ads was too pricey. So, we decided to pay people to sign up and even more to get their friends to join. This plan cost us $20 for each new customer, but it helped us grow by 7% every day. This meant our number of users almost doubled every 10 days. After a few months, we had hundreds of thousands of users and a chance to build a successful company by helping people send money for small fees, which was way more than what we spent to get customers.

The first company to take over the best part of a market with viral potential usually wins in the long run. At PayPal, we didn’t want random users; we aimed for the most valuable ones first. We noticed that many people were still using Western Union to send money home. Our service made it easy, but they didn’t use it often. So, we looked for a smaller group that used money more frequently. We found this group in eBay’s “PowerSellers,” who sold items online and had many auctions every day. There were about 20,000 of them, and they were excited to use our service because eBay’s payment option was terrible. Once PayPal became the main payment method for eBay, we couldn’t be caught by anyone else.

There’s a rule about how businesses grow that says some ways to reach customers are way more effective than others. Many new business owners think that trying everything will work, but that’s not true. Just hiring a few salespeople or running some ads won’t help much. Most businesses fail because they can’t find a good way to sell their product, not because their product is bad. If you can make just one way to sell your product work, you can have a successful business. But if you try many ways and none work, you’re done for.

Your company has to sell more than just its product. You also need to sell your company to employees and investors. Some people think that if a company is great, everyone will want to work there, or investors will want to give money without any effort. But that excitement usually doesn’t happen without a solid plan to attract people and pitch your ideas. Getting media attention is also important for selling your company to others. Some people who don’t trust the media think they can just ignore it. But just like you can’t expect people to buy a great product without a plan to promote it, you can’t assume they will admire your company without a public relations strategy.
