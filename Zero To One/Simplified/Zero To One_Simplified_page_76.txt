HOW TO FIND SECRETS

There are two types of secrets: secrets about nature and secrets about people. 

Natural secrets are all around us. To find them, you need to study something in the physical world that hasn’t been discovered yet. Secrets about people are different; they are things people don’t know about themselves or things they keep hidden because they don’t want others to find out. So, when thinking about what kind of company to create, you should ask two questions: What secrets is nature not telling you? What secrets are people not sharing with you?

It’s easy to think that natural secrets are the most important. People who search for them can seem really smart and serious. This is why people with physics PhDs can be hard to work with—they know a lot of important facts and think they know everything. But just because you understand complex science doesn’t mean you’re good at helping people with their personal problems. For example, I once interviewed a physics PhD for a job at PayPal. Halfway through my first question, he interrupted and said, “Stop! I already know what you’re going to ask!” But he was wrong, and I decided not to hire him right away.

Secrets about people are often overlooked. Maybe that’s because you don’t need a long education to ask the right questions to find them: What can people not talk about? What topics are off-limits? 

Sometimes, looking for natural secrets and human secrets can lead to the same discovery. Think about monopolies: competition and capitalism are opposites. If you didn’t know this, you could find out by studying corporate profits and seeing how competition affects them. But you could also take a human approach and ask: what can people running companies not say? You’d notice that companies with monopolies try to hide their status, while competitive companies often exaggerate how special they are. The differences between these companies might seem small, but they are actually huge.

The best place to find secrets is where no one else is looking. Most people only think about what they’ve been taught, and schools usually teach conventional ideas. So, you might wonder: are there important areas that haven’t been fully explored or organized? For example, physics is a popular major at universities, and it follows strict rules. The opposite of physics might be astrology, but astrology isn’t important. What about nutrition? Nutrition is important for everyone, but you can’t major in it at Harvard. Most top scientists choose other fields. Many big studies on nutrition were done 30 or 40 years ago, and most of them have serious problems. The food pyramid that told us to eat low fat and lots of grains was probably influenced more by food companies than real science; it has mostly made our obesity problem worse. There’s still so much to learn: we know more about the physics of distant stars than we do about human nutrition. It won’t be easy, but it’s not impossible either. This is exactly the kind of area that could reveal secrets.
