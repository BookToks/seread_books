HOW TO FIND SECRETS

There are two types of secrets: natural secrets and secrets about people. Natural secrets are all around us, and to find them, you need to study something new about the physical world. Secrets about people are different; they are things people don’t know about themselves or things they hide because they don’t want others to know. So, when thinking about what kind of company to create, you should ask two main questions: What secrets is nature hiding from you? What secrets are people hiding from you?

It’s easy to think that natural secrets are the most important. People who look for them can seem really smart and serious. That’s why physics PhDs can be hard to work with—they think they know everything just because they understand basic truths. But just because someone knows about electromagnetic theory doesn’t mean they can help you with your personal problems. For example, I once interviewed a physics PhD for a job at PayPal. Halfway through my first question, he interrupted me and said, “Stop! I already know what you’re going to ask!” But he was wrong, and it was an easy choice to not hire him.

Secrets about people are often overlooked. Maybe that’s because you don’t need a long education to ask the right questions to find them: What can people not talk about? What is considered taboo? Sometimes, looking for natural secrets and human secrets can lead to the same discovery. For example, think about monopolies: competition and capitalism are opposites. You could find this out by studying corporate profits and seeing that competition lowers them. But you could also ask what company leaders aren’t allowed to say. You’d notice that monopolists try to hide their monopoly status, while competitive companies exaggerate how unique they are. The differences between these companies might seem small, but they are actually huge.

The best place to find secrets is where no one else is looking. Most people only think about what they’ve been taught, and schools usually teach conventional ideas. So, you might wonder: are there important fields that haven’t been fully explored? Physics is a common major at universities, and it’s pretty set in its ways. The opposite of physics might be astrology, but astrology isn’t important. What about nutrition? Nutrition is important for everyone, but you can’t major in it at Harvard. Most top scientists go into other fields, and many big studies on nutrition were done decades ago and have serious flaws. The food pyramid that told us to eat low-fat foods and lots of grains was likely influenced more by food companies than real science, and it has contributed to the obesity problem. We actually know more about distant stars than we do about human nutrition. It won’t be easy, but it’s definitely possible to discover new secrets in this area.
