Tesla is set to become even more popular in the future. One big reason is that it has a strong brand. Buying a car is a huge decision for most people, and it’s tough to earn their trust. Plus, Tesla’s founder is still running the company, so they’re not slowing down anytime soon.

Tesla understood that looking good matters when it comes to eco-friendly tech. Wealthy people especially wanted to seem “green,” even if it meant driving cars like the boxy Prius or the clunky Honda Insight. Those cars only looked cool because famous eco-friendly celebrities drove them. So, Tesla decided to create cars that made drivers look cool on their own. For example, Leonardo DiCaprio even switched from his Prius to a fancy Tesla Roadster.

While other eco-friendly companies struggled to stand out, Tesla created a unique brand. They realized that being eco-friendly was more about social status than just saving the environment.
