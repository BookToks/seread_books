Tesla is set to become even more popular in the coming years. A strong brand is the best sign of Tesla’s success. Buying a car is a huge decision for people, and it’s tough to earn their trust. Plus, the founder is still running Tesla, so they’re not going to slow down anytime soon.

Tesla realized that looking good was important for people interested in clean technology. Wealthy people especially wanted to seem “green,” even if it meant driving cars like the boxy Prius or the clunky Honda Insight. Those cars only looked cool because famous eco-friendly celebrities drove them. So, Tesla decided to make cars that made drivers look cool all on their own. For example, Leonardo DiCaprio even switched from his Prius to a fancy Tesla Roadster. While other clean tech companies struggled to stand out, Tesla created a unique brand by showing that clean technology was more about social status than just helping the environment.
