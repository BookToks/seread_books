EXTENDING THE FOUNDING

Bob Dylan once said that if you’re not busy being born, you’re busy dying. If he’s right, being born isn’t just a one-time thing—you might keep doing it in a way, at least in a creative sense. 

But when it comes to starting a company, that moment really only happens once. At the very beginning, you get the chance to set the rules that will help everyone work together to create value in the future. 

The best companies stay open to new ideas, which is something that usually happens at the start. This leads to another point about founding: it lasts as long as a company keeps creating new things, and it ends when that stops. 

If you get the start right, you can do more than just build a valuable company. You can guide its future toward making new things instead of just managing past successes. You might even keep that founding spirit alive for a long time.
