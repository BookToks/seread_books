Bob Dylan once said that if you're not busy being born, you're busy dying. If he's right, being born isn't just a one-time thingâ€”you might keep doing it in a way, at least in a creative sense. But when it comes to starting a company, that moment only happens once. At the very beginning, you get to set the rules that will help everyone work together to create something valuable in the future.

The best companies stay open to new ideas, which is something that usually happens at the start. This leads to another important point about founding: it lasts as long as a company keeps creating new things, and it ends when that stops. If you nail the founding moment, you can do more than just build a valuable company. You can guide its future toward creating new things instead of just managing past successes. You could even keep that founding spirit alive forever.
