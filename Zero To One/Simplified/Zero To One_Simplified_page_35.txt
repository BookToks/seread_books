Then Informix's CEO, Phil White, decided to get personal. When he found out that Larry Ellison liked Japanese samurai culture, he made a billboard showing the Oracle logo with a broken samurai sword. This ad wasn’t really aimed at Oracle as a company or the public; it was more like a personal dig at Ellison. But maybe White was too focused on his competition: while he was busy making billboards, Informix fell apart due to a huge accounting scandal, and White ended up in federal prison for securities fraud.

If you can’t beat a rival, it might be smarter to team up. I started a company called Confinity with my co-founder Max Levchin in 1998. When we launched PayPal in late 1999, Elon Musk’s X.com was right behind us. Our offices were only four blocks apart in Palo Alto, and X’s product was almost exactly like ours. By late 1999, we were in a fierce battle. Many of us at PayPal worked over 100 hours a week. It wasn’t the best way to be productive, but we were more focused on beating X.com than anything else. One of our engineers even designed a bomb to help us win, but when he showed it at a meeting, everyone realized it was just a crazy idea from being too tired.

But in February 2000, Elon and I were more worried about the tech bubble getting too big than about each other: a financial crash could ruin us both before we finished our fight. So in early March, we met at a café halfway between our offices and agreed to merge our companies 50-50. It wasn’t easy to stop being rivals after merging, but it was a good problem to have. Together, we managed to survive the dot-com crash and build a successful business.

Sometimes you have to fight, and when you do, you should fight to win. There’s no middle ground: either don’t fight at all, or go all in and finish it quickly. This can be tough because pride and honor can get in the way. In Hamlet, it’s said that true greatness means being willing to fight for even the smallest reasons. Anyone would fight for things that really matter, but true heroes take their honor so seriously that they’ll fight for things that don’t matter at all. This way of thinking is part of being human, but it can be a disaster in business. If you can see competition as something harmful instead of something valuable, you’re already ahead of most people. The next chapter will explain how to keep a clear mind to build a successful business.
