MONOPOLY CAPITALISM

A monopoly is great for the people running it, but what about everyone else? Do these huge profits hurt regular people? Yes, they do: the money comes from customers, and monopolies have a bad name for a reason—especially if nothing changes.

In a world where nothing changes, a monopolist is just someone who collects rent. If you control the market for something, you can raise the price, and people have no choice but to buy from you. Think about the board game Monopoly: properties get traded, but the game itself never changes. You can’t win by creating something better; you just try to buy everything up.

But our world is always changing: new and better things can be invented. Creative monopolists give customers more choices by adding new options to the market. These kinds of monopolies aren’t just good for society; they help make it better.

Even the government gets this. One part of it tries to create monopolies by giving patents for new inventions, while another part goes after them with antitrust laws. It’s debatable whether someone should get a legal monopoly just for being the first to come up with something like a mobile app. But it’s clear that Apple’s profits from the iPhone came from creating something really useful, not from making things scarce. Customers were happy to pay high prices for a smartphone that actually works.

The fact that new monopolies keep popping up is why old monopolies don’t stop innovation. With Apple’s iOS leading the way, mobile computing has taken over Microsoft’s long-time hold on operating systems. Before that, IBM’s hardware monopoly was replaced by Microsoft’s software monopoly. AT&T had a monopoly on phone service for most of the 20th century, but now anyone can get a cheap cell phone plan from many different companies. If monopolies really held back progress, they would be a problem, and we’d be right to fight against them. But history shows that better monopolies often replace the old ones.

Monopolies push progress because the chance to make big profits for years motivates them to innovate. They can keep improving because their profits allow them to plan long-term and fund ambitious research that competitive companies can’t even think about.

So why do economists focus so much on competition as the best way to do business? It’s an old idea. Economists took their math from 19th-century physics, viewing people and businesses as just interchangeable parts, not as unique creators. Their theories talk about perfect competition because it’s easier to model, not because it’s the best way to run a business. But remember, the long-term balance predicted by old physics was a state where everything is even and comes to a stop—also known as the heat death of the universe. In business, balance means stagnation, and stagnation means failure. If your industry is stuck in competition, the end of your business won’t matter; someone else will always be ready to take your place.
