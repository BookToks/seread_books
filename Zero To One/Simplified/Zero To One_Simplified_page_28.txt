MONOPOLY CAPITALISM

A monopoly is great for the people running it, but what about everyone else? Do these huge profits hurt regular people? Yes, they do: the money comes from customers, and monopolies have a bad reputation for a reason—but only if nothing ever changes.

In a world that stays the same, a monopolist is like a rent collector. If you control the market for something, you can raise the price, and people have no choice but to buy from you. Think of the game Monopoly: properties get traded between players, but the game itself never changes. There’s no way to win by creating a better type of property. The value of the properties stays the same forever, so all you can do is try to buy them all.

But we live in a world that changes all the time: it’s possible to invent new and better things. Creative monopolists give customers more choices by bringing new products into the world. These kinds of monopolies aren’t just good for society; they help make it better.

Even the government gets this: one part tries to create monopolies by giving patents for new inventions, while another part tries to break them up by going after companies that are too powerful. We can question if someone should get a legal monopoly just for being the first to come up with something, like a mobile app. But it’s clear that Apple’s profits from making the iPhone came from creating something useful, not from making things scarce. Customers were happy to pay a lot for a smartphone that actually works.

The fact that new monopolies keep popping up explains why old monopolies don’t stop innovation. With Apple’s iOS leading the way, mobile computing has taken over Microsoft’s long-time control of operating systems. Before that, IBM’s hardware monopoly in the '60s and '70s was replaced by Microsoft’s software monopoly. AT&T had a monopoly on phone service for most of the 20th century, but now anyone can get a cheap cell phone plan from many providers. If monopolies really held back progress, they would be dangerous, and we’d be right to fight against them. But history shows that better monopolies often replace the old ones.

Monopolies push for progress because the chance to make big profits for many years motivates them to innovate. They can keep improving because their profits allow them to plan for the future and fund big research projects that companies in competition can’t afford.

So why do economists focus so much on competition? It’s an old idea. Economists borrowed their math from 19th-century physics: they see people and businesses as the same, not as unique creators. Their theories describe a perfect competition because it’s easy to model, not because it’s the best way to do business. But remember, the long-term balance predicted by 19th-century physics was a state where everything is even and comes to a stop—also known as the heat death of the universe. Whatever you think about physics, it’s a strong image: in business, balance means nothing changes, and nothing changing means failure. If your industry is stuck in competition, the end of your business won’t matter; someone else will always be ready to take your place.
