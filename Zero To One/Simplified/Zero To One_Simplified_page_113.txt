SEEING GREEN

At the beginning of the 21st century, everyone thought clean technology was the future. It had to be because in Beijing, the air was so polluted that people couldn’t see from one building to another, and breathing was dangerous. In Bangladesh, the water was so contaminated with arsenic that it was called “the biggest mass poisoning in history” by the New York Times. In the U.S., hurricanes like Ivan and Katrina were seen as signs of the destruction that global warming could bring. Al Gore urged us to tackle these issues with the same seriousness as if we were going to war. People got to work: entrepreneurs launched thousands of cleantech companies, and investors put over $50 billion into them. This was the start of trying to clean up the planet.

But it didn’t go as planned. Instead of a healthier Earth, we ended up with a huge cleantech bubble. Solyndra is the most well-known failure, but many cleantech companies faced similar fates—over 40 solar manufacturers went out of business or declared bankruptcy in 2012 alone. The main index for alternative energy companies showed a big drop in value.

So, why did cleantech fail? Some conservatives think they know the answer: they believe that as soon as the government made green energy a priority, it messed things up. However, there are still good reasons to focus on energy. The truth about cleantech is more complicated and important than just blaming the government. Most cleantech companies failed because they didn’t answer one or more of the seven key questions that every business needs to consider.
