SEEING GREEN

At the beginning of the 21st century, everyone thought clean technology was going to be the next big thing. It had to be because in Beijing, the air was so polluted that people couldn’t see from one building to another, and breathing the air was dangerous. In Bangladesh, the water was so contaminated with arsenic that it was called “the biggest mass poisoning in history” by the New York Times. In the U.S., hurricanes like Ivan and Katrina were seen as signs of the serious damage that global warming could cause. Al Gore urged us to tackle these issues with the same seriousness as if we were preparing for war. People got to work: entrepreneurs started thousands of clean tech companies, and investors put in over $50 billion. This was the start of the effort to make the world cleaner.

But it didn’t work out as planned. Instead of a healthier planet, we ended up with a huge clean tech bubble. Solyndra is the most well-known failure, but many other clean tech companies also failed—over 40 solar manufacturers went out of business or declared bankruptcy in 2012 alone. The main index for alternative energy companies shows how badly the bubble burst.

So, why did clean tech fail? Some conservatives think they know the answer: they believe that as soon as the government made green energy a priority, it messed things up. But there were (and still are) good reasons to focus on energy. The truth about clean tech is more complicated and more important than just blaming the government. Most clean tech companies failed because they didn’t answer one or more of the seven important questions that every business needs to consider:

Can you create groundbreaking technology instead of just making small improvements?
