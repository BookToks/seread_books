If even investors who focus on fast-growing startups don't see the big picture, it's no surprise that most people miss it too. Power law distributions are so huge that they can be hard to notice. 

For example, when people outside Silicon Valley think of venture capital, they might imagine a small, quirky groupâ€”kind of like the show Shark Tank, but without the ads. The truth is, less than 1% of new businesses in the U.S. get venture funding, and all the venture capital investment is less than 0.2% of the country's total economic output. 

But the companies that do get this funding have a huge impact on the economy. Venture-backed companies create 11% of all private sector jobs and make annual revenues that are about 21% of the GDP. In fact, the 12 biggest tech companies all got their start with venture capital. Together, these companies are worth over $2 trillion, which is more than all the other tech companies put together.
