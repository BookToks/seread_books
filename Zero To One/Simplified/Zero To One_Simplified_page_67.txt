If even investors who focus on super-fast-growing startups don’t see the power law, it makes sense that most people miss it too. Power law distributions are so huge that they can be hard to notice. For example, when people outside Silicon Valley think about venture capital, they might imagine a small, quirky group—like on ABC’s Shark Tank, but without the ads. 

In reality, less than 1% of new businesses started each year in the U.S. get venture funding, and total VC investment is less than 0.2% of the country’s GDP. But the companies that do get this funding really boost the economy. Venture-backed companies create 11% of all private sector jobs and make yearly revenues that equal about 21% of GDP. In fact, the twelve biggest tech companies all got venture backing. Together, these 12 companies are worth over $2 trillion, which is more than all the other tech companies put together.
