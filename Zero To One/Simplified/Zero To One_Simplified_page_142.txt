STAGNATION OR SINGULARITY?  

If even the smartest founders can’t plan for more than 20 to 30 years ahead, can we really say anything about the far-off future? We don’t know exact details, but we can see some general ideas.  

Philosopher Nick Bostrom talks about four possible futures for humanity. In the past, people thought history was just a cycle of good times and bad times. Recently, some have started to believe we might be able to avoid bad times for good, but we still wonder if the stability we enjoy now will last.  

Usually, we push these worries aside. Most people seem to think that the whole world will eventually develop to a level like that of the richest countries today. In this idea, the future will look a lot like our present.
