FOUNDING MATRIMONY

When you start something new, the most important choice is who you start it with. 

Picking a co-founder is like getting married, and if things go bad, it can be as messy as a divorce. 

At the beginning of any partnership, everyone is super optimistic. It’s not fun to think about what could go wrong, so many people don’t. But if the founders can’t get along, the company suffers. 

In 1999, Luke Nosek was one of my co-founders at PayPal, and I still work with him today at Founders Fund. But a year before PayPal, I invested in a company that Luke started with someone else. It was his first startup, and one of my first investments. We didn’t realize it back then, but the company was set to fail from the start because Luke and his co-founder were a bad match. 

Luke is a smart and creative thinker, while his co-founder was more of a business type who just wanted to cash in on the ’90s tech boom. They met at a networking event, chatted for a bit, and decided to start a company together. That’s like marrying the first person you meet at a casino: you might get lucky, but it’s more likely to flop. Their company failed, and I lost my money. 

Now, when I think about investing in a startup, I look closely at the founding teams. It’s important that they have the right skills, but it’s just as important that they know each other well and can work together. Founders should have a history together before starting a company; otherwise, they’re just taking a gamble.
