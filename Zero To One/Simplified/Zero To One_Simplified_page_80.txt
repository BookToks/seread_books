FOUNDING MATRIMONY

When you start something new, the first and most important choice is who you’re starting it with. Picking a co-founder is like getting married, and problems between founders can be as messy as a divorce.

At the beginning of every partnership, people are usually really excited. It’s not fun to think about what could go wrong, so many don’t. But if the founders can’t get along, the company suffers.

In 1999, Luke Nosek was one of my co-founders at PayPal, and I still work with him today at Founders Fund. But before PayPal, I invested in a company Luke started with someone else. It was his first startup, and one of my first investments. We didn’t realize it at the time, but the project was doomed to fail because Luke and his co-founder were a bad match. Luke is a creative thinker, while his co-founder was more focused on making money quickly. They met at a networking event, chatted for a bit, and decided to start a company together. That’s like marrying the first person you meet at a casino: you might get lucky, but it’s more likely to fail. Their company fell apart, and I lost my money.

Now, when I think about investing in a startup, I look closely at the founding teams. It’s important to have the right skills, but it’s just as important to see how well the founders know each other and work together. Founders should have some history together before starting a company; otherwise, it’s like taking a gamble.
