What if the best option isn’t just solar energy, but renewable energy in general? 

Right now, the world makes 420 gigawatts of energy from renewables each year. That means your 100 megawatts is only 0.02% of the market. When you look at the total global power generation, which is 15,000 gigawatts, your 100 megawatts is really tiny. 

Cleantech entrepreneurs often get confused about their markets. They try to make their market seem smaller to stand out, but then they want to be valued based on huge markets that are hard to reach. You can’t be the best in a made-up market, and big markets are really competitive, not easy to get into. Most cleantech founders would have had a better chance opening a new British restaurant in downtown Palo Alto.
