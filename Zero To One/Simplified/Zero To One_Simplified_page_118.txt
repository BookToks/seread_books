What if the right focus isn’t just on solar energy, but on all kinds of renewable energy? 

Right now, renewable energy can produce 420 gigawatts worldwide, which is only 0.02% of the total market. When you look at the entire global power generation, which is 15,000 gigawatts, your 100 megawatts is really tiny. 

Many people starting clean technology businesses are confused about the market. They try to make their market seem special, but then they want to be valued like they’re part of a huge, profitable market. The problem is, you can’t be the best in a made-up market, and big markets are super competitive, not easy to win. Most people starting clean tech companies would have been better off opening a new British restaurant in downtown Palo Alto.
