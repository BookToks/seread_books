After 10 years, the investment results won’t just show winners and losers; they’ll show one big winner and a bunch of other stuff. 

But even though the final results seem clear, that’s not how things feel day-to-day. 

Investors spend a lot of time finding new investments and helping companies that are just starting out, so most of the companies they deal with are pretty average. 

The differences that investors and entrepreneurs notice every day are usually about how well companies are doing compared to each other, not about one company being super successful while others fail completely. 

Also, since nobody wants to give up on an investment, venture capitalists often end up spending more time on the struggling companies than on the ones that are clearly doing well.
