After 10 years, the investment results won’t just show winners and losers; there will be one big winner and everything else will be grouped together.

But even though the final outcome seems clear, it doesn’t match what happens day-to-day. 

Investors usually focus on making new investments and helping companies that are just starting out, so most of the companies they deal with are pretty average. 

The differences that investors and entrepreneurs notice every day are mostly about how successful a company is compared to others, not about huge wins or total failures. 

Since no one wants to give up on an investment, venture capitalists often spend more time trying to fix the struggling companies than they do on the ones that are clearly doing well.
