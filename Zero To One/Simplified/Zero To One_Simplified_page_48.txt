CAN YOU CONTROL YOUR FUTURE?

You can think of the future as something clear and certain, or you can see it as unclear and random. If you believe the future is certain, it makes sense to plan for it and try to shape it. But if you think the future is just random, you might stop trying to control it.

This unclear way of thinking about the future explains a lot of problems we see today. Instead of having real plans, people often just follow rules to gather a bunch of options. This is what many Americans do now. In middle school, we’re told to collect “extracurricular activities.” In high school, students compete to show they can do everything. By the time they get to college, they have spent years building a confusing list of activities to prepare for a future that is impossible to predict. In the end, they are ready for anything, but not really for anything specific.

On the other hand, thinking clearly about the future leads to strong beliefs. Instead of trying to be okay at a lot of things and calling it being “well-rounded,” someone with a clear goal focuses on the best thing to do and goes for it. Instead of working hard to blend in, they aim to be really great at something special. This isn’t what most young people do today because everyone around them has lost faith in a clear future. You can’t get into Stanford by just being good at one thing, unless that one thing is sports.

You can also think about the future as either better or worse than now. Optimists look forward to the future, while pessimists are scared of it. Mixing these ideas gives us four different views:

Indefinite Pessimism

Every culture has a story about how things were better in the past, and almost all people throughout history feel this way.
