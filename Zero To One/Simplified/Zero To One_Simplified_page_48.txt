CAN YOU CONTROL YOUR FUTURE?

You can think of the future as something clear and certain, or you can see it as unclear and random. If you believe the future is certain, it makes sense to plan for it and try to shape it. But if you think the future is uncertain, you might stop trying to control it.

This unclear view of the future explains a lot of the problems we see today. People often focus on following rules instead of making real plans. This is especially true for Americans. In middle school, we’re pushed to collect a bunch of “extracurricular activities.” In high school, students work even harder to seem like they can do everything. By the time they reach college, they have spent years building a confusing list of activities to prepare for a future that is totally unknown. In the end, they are ready for anything but don’t know what for.

On the other hand, if you have a clear view of the future, you can have strong beliefs. Instead of trying to be average at many things and calling it “well-rounded,” a person with a clear goal focuses on one important thing and works hard at it. Instead of blending in, they aim to be really good at something unique. This isn’t what most young people do today because everyone around them has lost faith in a clear future. You can’t get into Stanford just by being good at one thing unless that thing is sports.

You can also think about the future as being better or worse than now. Optimists look forward to the future, while pessimists are scared of it. Mixing these ideas gives us four different views.
