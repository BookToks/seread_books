THE CHALLENGE OF THE FUTURE

When I interview someone for a job, I like to ask this question: “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?” 

This question seems simple because it’s clear. But it’s actually really hard to answer. It’s tough because everything we learn in school is usually accepted by most people. It’s also hard because anyone trying to answer has to say something that might be unpopular. Smart ideas are rare, but having the guts to share them is even rarer.

Most of the time, I hear answers like these: “Our education system is broken and needs fixing.” “America is special.” “There is no God.” 

Those answers aren’t great. The first two might be true, but lots of people already think that way. The third one just picks a side in a common argument. A good answer should be something like: “Most people believe in X, but the truth is the opposite of X.” I’ll share my own answer later in this chapter.

So, what does this tricky question have to do with the future? In simple terms, the future is just all the moments that haven’t happened yet. But what makes the future special is that it will be a time when the world looks different from now. If nothing changes in our society for the next 100 years, then the future is really far away. But if big changes happen in the next ten years, then the future is right around the corner. No one can predict the future perfectly, but we know two things: it’s going to be different, and it has to be based on what we have today. Most answers to the tricky question show different ways of looking at the present; good answers are our best guess at what the future might hold.
