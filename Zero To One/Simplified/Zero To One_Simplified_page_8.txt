THE CHALLENGE OF THE FUTURE

When I interview someone for a job, I like to ask this question: “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?” 

This question seems simple because it’s direct. But it’s actually really hard to answer. It’s tough to think about because what we learn in school is usually what everyone agrees on. It’s also hard to say something that might be unpopular. Smart ideas are rare, but having the guts to share them is even rarer.

Most of the time, I hear answers like these: “Our education system is broken and needs to be fixed.” “America is special.” “There is no God.” 

Those aren’t great answers. The first two might be true, but lots of people already agree with them. The third one just picks a side in a common argument. A good answer would be something like: “Most people believe in x, but the truth is the opposite of x.” I’ll share my own answer later in this chapter.

So, what does this question have to do with the future? Basically, the future is just all the moments that haven’t happened yet. But what makes the future special is that it will be different from today. If nothing changes in our society for the next 100 years, then the future is really far away. But if things change a lot in the next ten years, then the future is coming soon. 

No one can predict the future perfectly, but we know two things: it’s going to be different, and it has to be based on what’s happening today. Most answers to the question show different ways of looking at the present, and good answers help us get a glimpse of the future.
