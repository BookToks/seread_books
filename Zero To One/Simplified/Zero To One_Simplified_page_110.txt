The term “big data” is a popular way to talk about our obsession with collecting information. Nowadays, companies really want more data, thinking that having more will always make things better. But a lot of big data isn’t very useful. Computers can spot patterns that people might miss, but they can’t really compare different patterns or understand complicated behaviors. The best insights come from human analysts, or from advanced AI that only exists in movies.

We’ve become fascinated by big data because we think technology is amazing. We get excited about small things computers can do, but we overlook the bigger successes that happen when humans and technology work together. Programs like Watson and Deep Blue are impressive, but the top companies in the future won’t just focus on what computers can do alone. They’ll be asking how computers can help people tackle tough problems.
