The other trendy word that shows a focus on replacing things is “big data.” Nowadays, companies really want a lot of data, thinking that having more data always means getting better results. But big data can often be useless data. Computers can spot patterns that people might miss, but they can’t compare patterns from different places or understand complicated behaviors. Useful insights can only come from a human analyst or a type of advanced artificial intelligence that we only see in movies.

We’ve become fascinated by big data because we think technology is amazing. We get impressed by small things computers can do on their own, but we overlook the bigger successes that happen when humans and technology work together because those feel less magical. Programs like Watson and Deep Blue, along with smarter machine learning, are impressive. However, the best companies in the future won’t just ask what problems computers can solve by themselves. They’ll ask: how can computers help people tackle tough problems?
