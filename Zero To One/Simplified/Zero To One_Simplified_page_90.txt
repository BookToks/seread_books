RECRUITING CONSPIRATORS

Hiring the right people is super important for any company. You shouldn’t let someone else do it for you. You need team members who not only have the right skills but can also work well together once they’re on board. The first few hires might be drawn in by big stock options or cool job titles. But what really matters is this question: 

Why would the 20th employee want to join your company?

Skilled people have lots of choices. So, you need to think deeper: 

Why would someone pick your company as its 20th engineer when they could go work at Google for better pay and a more impressive job?

Here are some bad answers: “Your stock options will be worth more here than anywhere else.” “You’ll work with the smartest people.” “You can help solve tough problems.” The issue with these answers is that every company says the same stuff, so they don’t make you stand out. General claims don’t explain why someone should choose your company over others.

The best answers are specific to your company, and you won’t find them in this book. But there are two main types of good answers: those about your mission and those about your team. You’ll attract the right employees if you can show why your mission is exciting—not just why it’s important, but why you’re doing something special that no one else is doing. For example, at PayPal, if you were excited about creating a new digital currency to replace the U.S. dollar, we wanted to talk to you; if not, you weren’t the right fit.

However, even a great mission isn’t enough. The right recruit will also ask, “Are these the kind of people I want to work with?” You should be able to explain why your company is a perfect match for them personally. If you can’t, they probably aren’t the right fit.

Most importantly, don’t get caught up in offering perks. If someone is swayed by free laundry or pet daycare, they might not be a good fit for your team. Just cover the basics like health insurance and promise what others can’t: the chance to do meaningful work on a unique problem with great people. You might not be able to offer the same pay or perks as Google does now, but you can still be like the Google of 1999 if you have strong answers about your mission and team.
