RECRUITING TEAM MEMBERS

Hiring the right people is super important for any company. You shouldn't let someone else do it for you. You need people who not only have the right skills but also get along well after they join. The first few people might be interested in big paychecks or cool job titles. But the real question is: 

Why should the 20th person want to work at your company?

Smart and talented people have lots of choices. So, you should ask yourself: 

Why would someone choose to be your 20th engineer when they could go work at Google for more money and a better reputation?

Here are some bad answers: “Your stock options will be worth more here than anywhere else.” “You’ll work with the smartest people.” “You can help solve the world’s biggest problems.” These answers aren’t good because every company says the same things, so they won’t make you stand out. General answers don’t explain why someone should pick your company over others.

The best answers are specific to your company, so you won’t find them in this book. But there are two types of good answers: ones about your mission and ones about your team. You’ll attract the right employees if you can explain why your mission is exciting. It’s not enough to say it’s important in general; you need to show why what you’re doing is special and unique. At PayPal, if you were excited about creating a new digital currency to replace the U.S. dollar, we wanted to talk to you. If not, you probably wouldn’t fit in.

Even a great mission isn’t enough. The kind of person you want will also think: “Are these the people I want to work with?” You should be able to explain why your company is a good fit for them personally. If you can’t do that, they might not be the right person for your team.

Most importantly, don’t get caught up in offering lots of perks. If someone is more interested in free laundry service or pet daycare, they might not be a good fit for your team. Just provide the basics like health insurance and then offer what others can’t: the chance to do important work on a unique problem with great people. You might not be able to compete with Google’s perks today, but you can be like the Google of 1999 if you have good answers about your mission and team.
