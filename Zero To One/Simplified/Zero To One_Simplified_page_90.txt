RECRUITING CONSPIRATORS

Hiring the right people is super important for any company. You shouldn’t let someone else handle it. You need folks who not only have the right skills but can also work well together once they’re on board. The first few hires might be drawn in by big stock options or cool job titles. But what really matters is answering this question: 

Why should the 20th employee want to join your company?

Smart people have lots of job choices. You need to think about this: 

Why would someone pick your company as its 20th engineer when they could go work at Google for better pay and a fancier title?

Here are some bad answers: “Your stock options will be worth more here.” “You’ll work with the smartest people.” “You can help solve big problems.” While these things sound good, every company says them, so they won’t make you stand out. Generic answers don’t explain why someone should choose your company over others.

The best answers are specific to your company, so you won’t find them in a book. But there are two types of good answers: ones about your mission and ones about your team. You’ll attract the right employees if you can explain why your mission is exciting. It’s not enough to say it’s important; you need to show why what you’re doing is special and different. For example, at PayPal, if you were excited about creating a new digital currency, we wanted to talk to you; if not, you weren’t the right fit.

Even a great mission isn’t enough. The right person will also ask, “Are these the kind of people I want to work with?” You need to explain why your company is a good match for them personally. If you can’t do that, they probably aren’t the right fit.

Most importantly, don’t get caught up in offering tons of perks. If someone is more interested in free laundry service or pet daycare, they might not be the best addition to your team. Just provide the basics like health insurance, and then promise what others can’t: the chance to do meaningful work on a unique problem with great people. You might not be able to offer the same pay or perks as Google in 2014, but you can be like Google in 1999 if you have solid answers about your mission and team.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** Hiring the right people is crucial for any company. Focus on your mission and team to attract talent, rather than just perks. Explain why your company is unique and why the work matters.
