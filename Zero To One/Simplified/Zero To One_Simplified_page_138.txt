Recently, Bill Gates has shown that being super successful can lead to a lot of criticism. 

He was the classic founder type: a nerdy college dropout who became the richest person in the world. Did he wear his geeky glasses on purpose to stand out? Or did he just wear them because he’s a nerd? It’s hard to tell. But one thing is clear: he was really successful. In 2000, Microsoft’s Windows had 90% of the market for operating systems. That year, Peter Jennings even asked, “Who is more important in the world today: Bill Clinton or Bill Gates? I don’t know. It’s a good question.” 

The U.S. Department of Justice didn’t just ask questions; they started an investigation and sued Microsoft for unfair business practices. In June 2000, a court said Microsoft had to be split up. Gates had already stepped down as CEO six months earlier because he was too busy dealing with legal issues instead of working on new tech. Later, a higher court canceled the breakup order, and Microsoft made a deal with the government in 2001. But by then, Gates’s rivals had already taken away his full involvement in the company, and Microsoft started to struggle. Now, Gates is better known for his charity work than for his tech skills.
