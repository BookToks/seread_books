Recently, Bill Gates has shown how being super successful can lead to a lot of criticism. He was the classic founder type: a nerdy college dropout who became the richest person in the world. Did he wear those geeky glasses on purpose to create a unique image? Or did he just wear them because he’s a nerd? It’s hard to tell. But there’s no doubt he was on top: Microsoft’s Windows had a 90% share of the operating system market in 2000. That year, Peter Jennings even asked, “Who is more important today: Bill Clinton or Bill Gates? I don’t know. It’s a good question.”

The U.S. Department of Justice didn’t just ask questions; they started an investigation and sued Microsoft for unfair business practices. In June 2000, a court said Microsoft had to be split up. Gates had already stepped down as CEO six months earlier because he was busy dealing with legal issues instead of creating new tech. Later, a court overturned the breakup order, and Microsoft settled with the government in 2001. But by then, Gates’s rivals had already kept him from being fully involved in his company, and Microsoft didn’t grow much after that. Now, Gates is better known for his charity work than for his tech skills.
