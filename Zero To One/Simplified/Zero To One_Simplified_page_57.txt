IS INDEFINITE OPTIMISM EVEN POSSIBLE?

What kind of future will our hopeful decisions create? If American families were saving money, they could expect to have cash to spend later. And if American companies were investing, they could look forward to making more money in the future. But right now, U.S. families are saving almost nothing. And U.S. companies are just holding onto their cash instead of investing in new projects because they don’t have clear plans for what’s next.

There are three other ways to think about the future. Definite optimism works when you create the future you want. Definite pessimism works by making things that can be copied without hoping for anything new. Indefinite pessimism works because if you don’t expect much, you probably won’t get much. But indefinite optimism seems hard to keep going: how can the future improve if no one is planning for it?

Actually, most people today have heard an answer to this question: progress without planning is called “evolution.” Darwin said that life tends to “progress” even if no one is trying to make it happen. Every living thing is just a random version of another organism, and the best versions survive.

Darwin’s ideas explain how creatures like trilobites and dinosaurs came to be, but can we use them to understand other areas? Just like Newtonian physics can’t explain black holes or the Big Bang, it’s unclear if Darwin’s ideas can help us figure out how to create a better society or start a new business. Recently, people have started using Darwinian ideas in business. Journalists compare survival in nature to survival in the market, leading to headlines like “Digital Darwinism” and “Survival of the Clickiest.”

Even in tech-focused Silicon Valley, the latest trends talk about building a “lean startup” that can “adapt” and “evolve” in a changing world. New entrepreneurs are told that they can’t know everything in advance: they should pay attention to what customers want, create a simple version of their product, and improve it step by step.
