THE SECRET QUESTION

Every cleantech company thought they were doing the right thing by saying we need a cleaner world. They convinced themselves that because people wanted alternative energy, it meant there was a big chance to make money in cleantech. 

By 2006, it was pretty common to be excited about solar energy. That year, President George W. Bush talked about how families could have “solar roofs” to make their own electricity. Investor Bill Gross said that solar energy had huge potential. Suvi Sharma, who was the CEO of a solar company called Solaria, said there was a lot of excitement about solar, but there was also real opportunity, like sunshine. 

However, jumping on the solar bandwagon led many companies, like Q-Cells, Evergreen Solar, SpectraWatt, and even Gross’s own Energy Innovations, to go from having bright futures to going bankrupt really fast. Each of these companies thought they had a great future based on ideas everyone agreed on. But successful companies often have hidden reasons for their success that others don’t notice.
