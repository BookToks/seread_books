THE SECRET QUESTION

Every cleantech company claimed they were important because the world needs to be cleaner. They tricked themselves into thinking that since people wanted alternative energy, it meant there were tons of business chances for cleantech companies.

By 2006, it was pretty common to be excited about solar energy. That year, President George W. Bush talked about how families could have “solar roofs” to make their own electricity. Investor Bill Gross said the “potential for solar is huge.” Suvi Sharma, the CEO of a solar company called Solaria, said there was a feeling like a “gold rush” for solar, but there was also real value in it—like sunshine.

However, jumping on the solar bandwagon too quickly led many solar panel companies, like Q-Cells, Evergreen Solar, and SpectraWatt, to go from having bright futures to filing for bankruptcy really fast. Each of these companies had talked about their great futures using ideas everyone agreed on. But successful companies often have hidden reasons for their success that others don’t notice.
