THE MECHANICS OF MAFIA

Let’s think about what the perfect company culture would be like. Employees should really enjoy their jobs. They should like going to work so much that they don’t even pay attention to the clock. The office should be open and friendly, not filled with boring cubicles. It should feel like home, with beanbag chairs and Ping-Pong tables instead of just desks. Free massages, sushi chefs, and maybe even yoga classes would make it even better. Pets should be allowed too, so employees’ dogs and cats could hang out with the office fish.

But what’s wrong with this idea? It has some crazy perks that companies in Silicon Valley are known for, but it lacks real meaning—and without meaning, these perks don’t help. You can’t really achieve anything important just by hiring someone to decorate your office, fix your policies, or come up with fancy words. “Company culture” isn’t something separate from the company itself: every company is its own culture. A startup is a group of people working together toward a goal, and a good culture is just how that teamwork feels on the inside.
