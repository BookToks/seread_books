LET'S THINK ABOUT THE IDEAL WORKPLACE

Imagine what the perfect company culture would be like. Employees should really enjoy their jobs. They should love coming to work so much that they don’t even care about the clock. The office should be open and friendly, not filled with boring cubicles. It could have comfy beanbag chairs and Ping-Pong tables instead of just boring desks. Free massages, sushi chefs, and even yoga classes would make it even better. Plus, pets should be allowed! Employees’ dogs and cats could hang out with the office’s fish as fun mascots.

But what’s wrong with this idea? While it sounds cool with all the fancy perks that companies in Silicon Valley are known for, it lacks real meaning—and without real meaning, those perks don’t really help. You can’t achieve anything important just by hiring someone to make your office look nice, or by getting a consultant to change your rules, or by having someone come up with catchy phrases. “Company culture” isn’t something separate from the company itself; every company is its own culture. A startup is just a group of people working together towards a goal, and a good culture is simply how that teamwork feels inside.
