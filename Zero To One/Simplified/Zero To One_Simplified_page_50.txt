Did anyone in the past think that such amazing ideas were hidden in the work people did? Each new generation had inventors and dreamers who did even better than the ones before them. In 1843, people in London got to cross under the River Thames for the first time using a new tunnel. In 1869, the Suez Canal made it easier for ships to travel between Europe and Asia without going all the way around Africa. Then in 1914, the Panama Canal made it quicker to get from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. Even during the Great Depression, the United States kept moving forward, thanks to its optimistic people. The Empire State Building started being built in 1929 and was done in 1931. The Golden Gate Bridge began in 1933 and was finished in 1937. The Manhattan Project, which started in 1941, created the first nuclear bomb by 1945. 

Americans kept changing the world even when there was peace. The Interstate Highway System began in 1956, and by 1965, 20,000 miles of new roads were ready for driving. NASA’s Apollo Program started in 1961 and sent 12 astronauts to the moon by 1972. Big ideas weren’t just for politicians or scientists. In the late 1940s, a California schoolteacher named John Reber wanted to change the entire San Francisco Bay Area. He was also a theater producer and taught himself engineering. Even though he didn’t have any official titles, he suggested building two huge dams, creating big lakes for drinking water, and reclaiming 20,000 acres of land for new buildings. People took his plan seriously, and newspapers supported it. Congress even looked into whether it could work. The Army Corps of Engineers even made a small model of the Bay to test it out. They found some problems, so the plan never happened.

But would anyone today take such a big idea seriously? Back in the 1950s, people were excited about big plans and wanted to see if they could work. Now, if a schoolteacher had a big idea, people would probably laugh it off, and if someone powerful had a long-term vision, they’d be called arrogant. You can still visit the Bay Model in Sausalito, but now it’s just a tourist spot. Big plans for the future feel like old-fashioned ideas now.
