Did anyone in the past think that such amazing ideas were hiding in the work of everyday people? Each new generation of inventors and dreamers did even better than the last. In 1843, people in London got to cross under the River Thames for the first time through a new tunnel. In 1869, the Suez Canal made shipping between Europe and Asia much faster. Then in 1914, the Panama Canal made it easier to travel from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. Even during the Great Depression, the U.S. kept moving forward. The Empire State Building started being built in 1929 and was done in 1931. The Golden Gate Bridge began construction in 1933 and was finished in 1937. The Manhattan Project kicked off in 1941 and created the first nuclear bomb by 1945. 

Americans kept changing the world even in peaceful times. The Interstate Highway System started being built in 1956, and by 1965, 20,000 miles of roads were ready to drive on. NASA’s Apollo Program began in 1961 and got 12 men on the moon by 1972. Big ideas weren’t just for politicians or scientists. In the late 1940s, a guy named John Reber from California wanted to change the whole San Francisco Bay Area. He was a schoolteacher, an amateur theater producer, and taught himself engineering. Even though he wasn’t an expert, he suggested building two huge dams, creating big lakes for drinking water, and reclaiming 20,000 acres of land for development. People took his ideas seriously, and newspapers across California supported him. Congress even held meetings to see if his plan could work. The Army Corps of Engineers even made a small model of the Bay to test it out. But they found some problems, so the plan never happened.

But would anyone today take such a big idea seriously? Back in the 1950s, people liked big plans and wanted to know if they could succeed. Now, if a schoolteacher came up with a grand plan, people would just laugh it off, and if someone powerful had a long-term vision, they’d be seen as arrogant. You can still check out the Bay Model in that Sausalito warehouse, but now it’s just a tourist spot. Big plans for the future seem like old-fashioned ideas now.
