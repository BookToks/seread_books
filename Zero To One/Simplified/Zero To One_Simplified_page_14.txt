PARTY LIKE IT’S 1999

Our tricky question is: what important truth do very few people agree with you on? It’s hard to answer directly. So, let’s start with something easier: what does everyone agree on?

Famous thinker Nietzsche once said, “Madness is rare in individuals—but in groups, parties, nations, and ages it is the rule.” This means that while one person might be sane, groups can act really crazy. If you can spot a popular belief that doesn’t make sense, you might find a hidden truth behind it.

Think about this simple idea: companies are supposed to make money, not lose it. This should be obvious, right? But back in the late 1990s, many people didn’t see it that way. They thought that losing money was fine if it meant they would make even more money later. During this time, people believed that website visits were more important than actual profits.

People usually only realize that common beliefs are wrong after they fail. When this happens, we call it a bubble. But just because a bubble pops doesn’t mean the problems it caused go away. The internet craze of the ’90s was the biggest bubble since the stock market crash of 1929, and what we learned from it still affects how we think about technology today. The first step to thinking clearly is to question what we think we know about the past.
