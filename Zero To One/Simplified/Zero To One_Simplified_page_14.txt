PARTY LIKE IT’S 1999

Our tricky question is: What important truth do very few people agree with you on? It’s hard to answer directly, so let’s start with what everyone seems to agree on. Nietzsche once said, “Madness is rare in individuals—but in groups, parties, nations, and ages it is the rule.” This means that while one person might be sane, groups can act really crazy. If you can spot a popular belief that doesn’t make sense, you might uncover a hidden truth.

Take a simple idea: companies are supposed to make money, not lose it. This should be obvious, right? But back in the late 1990s, many people thought losing money was fine if it meant they would make even more in the future. During the “New Economy” era, people believed that the number of page views on a website was more important than actual profits.

People usually realize that common beliefs were wrong only after they fall apart. When this happens, we call it a bubble. But just because a bubble bursts doesn’t mean its effects go away. The internet boom of the ’90s was the biggest bubble since the 1929 crash, and what we learned from it still shapes how we think about technology today. To think clearly, we need to question what we believe we know about the past.
