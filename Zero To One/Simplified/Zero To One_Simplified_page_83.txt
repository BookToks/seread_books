ON THE BUS OR OFF THE BUS

Generally, everyone you work with in your company should be there full-time. Sometimes you might need to make exceptions, like hiring outside lawyers and accountants. But if someone doesn’t own stock options or get a regular paycheck from your company, they might not be fully committed. 

This can lead them to focus on short-term gains instead of helping you grow in the long run. That’s why hiring consultants usually doesn’t work. Part-time employees also don’t work out well. Even if someone is working remotely, it can cause problems because they aren’t together with the team all the time. 

When you’re thinking about bringing someone onto your team, the choice is clear. Ken Kesey was right: you’re either on the bus or off the bus.
