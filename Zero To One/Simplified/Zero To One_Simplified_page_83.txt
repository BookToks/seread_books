ON THE BUS OR OFF THE BUS

Generally, everyone you bring into your company should be working full-time. Sometimes, you might need to make exceptions, like hiring outside lawyers and accountants. But if someone doesn’t own stock options or get a regular paycheck from your company, they might not be fully committed. They could focus more on getting quick rewards instead of helping you build for the future. That’s why hiring consultants often doesn’t work.

Part-time workers usually don’t fit in either. Even having people work from home can cause problems because they might not feel as connected. It’s important that everyone is together full-time, in the same place, every day. When you’re thinking about bringing someone onto your team, it’s a clear choice. 

Ken Kesey was right: you’re either on the bus or off the bus.
