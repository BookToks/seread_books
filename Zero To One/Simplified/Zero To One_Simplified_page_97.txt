SALES IS HIDDEN

All salespeople are like actors: their main job is to convince you, not to be honest. That’s why the word “salesman” can sound bad, and used car dealers are often seen as shady. But we only dislike the awkward and obvious salespeople—the bad ones. There are many levels of sales skills, from beginners to experts and even masters. There are also sales grandmasters. If you haven’t met any grandmasters, it’s not because they don’t exist; it’s because they’re really good at hiding their skills.

Tom Sawyer got his friends to paint a fence for him, which was a smart move. But getting them to pay him for doing his chores was a grandmaster-level trick, and his friends didn’t even realize it. Not much has changed since Twain wrote this in 1876. 

Like acting, sales works best when it’s not obvious. That’s why most people in sales, marketing, or advertising have job titles that don’t mention those things. People who sell ads are called “account executives.” Those who find customers work in “business development.” People who sell companies are called “investment bankers.” And those who sell themselves are known as “politicians.” There’s a reason for these fancy names: nobody wants to be reminded that they’re being sold something.

In any job, being good at sales sets the superstars apart from the rest. On Wall Street, a new hire starts as an “analyst” with technical skills, but their goal is to become a dealmaker. Lawyers may have impressive degrees, but the top law firms are led by the rainmakers who bring in big clients. Even university professors, who think their knowledge is enough, envy those who know how to promote themselves. Ideas in history or English don’t just sell themselves because they’re smart. Even important topics like physics and cancer research rely on persuasion. The main reason businesspeople often underestimate sales is that it’s hidden at every level in a world that’s secretly driven by it.

Engineers dream of creating a product that “sells itself.” But if someone says this about a real product, they’re probably lying: either they’re fooling themselves or they’re trying to sell something. The opposite saying warns that “the best product doesn’t always win.” Economists call this “path dependence,” meaning that certain historical factors can decide which products become popular, regardless of quality. That’s true, but it doesn’t mean the systems we use today happened by chance. It’s better to think of selling as a crucial part of your product’s design. If you create something new but don’t have a good way to sell it, you have a bad business, no matter how great the product is.
