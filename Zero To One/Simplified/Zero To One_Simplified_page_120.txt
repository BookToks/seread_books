THE DISTRIBUTION QUESTION

Cleantech companies did a great job getting the attention of the government and investors, but they often forgot about the customers. They found out the hard way that selling and delivering a product is just as important as the product itself.

Take the Israeli electric vehicle startup Better Place, for example. From 2007 to 2012, they raised and spent over $800 million to create battery packs that could be swapped out and charging stations for electric cars. They wanted to make a greener option to reduce our reliance on polluting transportation. They did manage to sell 1,000 cars before going bankrupt, which was impressive because buying those cars was really complicated.

First off, it was unclear what you were actually buying. Better Place took regular cars from Renault and changed them to electric. So, were you getting an electric Renault or a Better Place car? If you wanted to buy one, you had to jump through a lot of hoops. You needed to get approval from Better Place, which meant proving you lived close to a battery swapping station and promising to drive on certain routes. If you passed that, you had to sign up for a subscription to recharge your car. Only then could you learn how to swap out battery packs while driving.

Better Place thought their technology was so cool that they didn’t need to market it well. Looking back on the company’s failure, one unhappy customer wondered why there wasn’t a big sign in Tel Aviv showing a picture of a Toyota Prius for 160,000 shekels next to a picture of their car for the same price plus four years of fuel. He still bought one, but he was a car enthusiast who would do anything to keep it running. Sadly, he can’t anymore. As the Better Place board said when they sold the company’s assets for just $12 million in 2013, “We solved the technical problems, but we couldn’t get past the other issues.”
