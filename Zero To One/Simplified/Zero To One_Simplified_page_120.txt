THE DISTRIBUTION QUESTION

Cleantech companies did a great job getting the attention of the government and investors, but they often forgot about the customers. They found out the hard way that selling and delivering a product is just as important as the product itself.

Take the Israeli electric vehicle startup Better Place, for example. From 2007 to 2012, they raised and spent over $800 million to create swappable battery packs and charging stations for electric cars. Their goal was to make a greener option that would reduce our reliance on polluting transportation. They did achieve that—at least by selling 1,000 cars before going bankrupt. Selling that many cars was impressive, but it was really hard for customers to buy them.

First of all, it was confusing to know what you were actually buying. Better Place took sedans from Renault and added electric batteries and motors. So, were you getting an electric Renault or a Better Place car? If you wanted to buy one, you had to go through a bunch of steps. First, you had to get approval from Better Place. To do that, you needed to show that you lived close to a battery swapping station and promise to drive specific routes. If you passed, you then had to sign up for a subscription to recharge your car. Only after all that could you learn how to swap out battery packs while driving.

Better Place thought their technology was so cool that they didn’t need to market it well. Looking back on the company’s failure, one unhappy customer wondered, “Why wasn’t there a big sign in Tel Aviv showing a picture of a Toyota Prius for 160,000 shekels next to a picture of this car, for 160,000 plus fuel for four years?” He ended up buying one of the cars, but he was a hobbyist who would do anything to keep it running. Sadly, he can’t anymore. As the Better Place board said when they sold the company’s assets for just $12 million in 2013, “We solved the technical problems, but we couldn’t overcome the other challenges.”
