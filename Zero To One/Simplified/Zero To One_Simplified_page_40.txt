CHARACTERISTICS OF MONOPOLY

What does a company with a lot of money coming in for a long time look like? Every monopoly is different, but they usually have some mix of these traits: special technology, network effects, economies of scale, and strong branding. This isn’t just a checklist for building your business—there’s no easy way to create a monopoly. However, looking at your business through these traits can help you think about how to make it last.

1. Proprietary Technology

Proprietary technology is a huge advantage for a company because it makes your product hard or impossible to copy. For example, Google’s search algorithms give better results than anyone else’s. Their technology for super-fast page loading and accurate search suggestions makes their search product really strong and hard to beat. It would be tough for anyone to do what Google did to other search engines back in the early 2000s.

A good rule of thumb is that proprietary technology needs to be at least 10 times better than the closest alternative to really create a monopoly advantage. If it’s not at least that much better, people might just see it as a small upgrade, and it could be hard to sell, especially in a crowded market. 

The best way to make a 10x improvement is to invent something totally new. If you create something valuable that didn’t exist before, the value can be limitless. For example, a drug that lets people not need sleep or a cure for baldness could definitely support a monopoly business. 

You can also make a big improvement to something that already exists. Once you’re 10 times better, you can avoid competition. PayPal, for instance, made buying and selling on eBay way better. Instead of waiting 7 to 10 days for a check to arrive, PayPal let buyers pay right after an auction ended. Sellers got their money right away and knew it was good.

Amazon made its first 10x improvement by offering way more books than any other bookstore. When it started in 1995, Amazon could say it was “Earth’s largest bookstore” because, unlike a regular bookstore that might have 100,000 books, Amazon didn’t need to keep any books in stock. They just asked their suppliers for the book when someone ordered it. This huge improvement was so effective that Barnes & Noble got really upset and sued Amazon just days before its IPO, saying Amazon was unfairly calling itself a “bookstore” when it was really a “book broker.”

You can also achieve a 10x improvement through better design. Before 2010, tablet computers were so bad that the market barely existed. Microsoft and Nokia tried to make tablets, but they were hard to use. Then Apple released the iPad. It’s hard to measure design improvements, but it’s clear that Apple made tablets go from useless to really useful.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** A monopoly is a company that has unique advantages like special technology and strong branding. To succeed, a business should aim for improvements that are ten times better than competitors. Examples include PayPal and Amazon, which transformed their markets with significant innovations.
