Leanness is more about how you do things than just having a goal. Making small changes to what’s already there might help you improve a bit, but it won’t help you reach the best possible outcome. For example, you could create an awesome app that lets people order toilet paper from their iPhone. But just making small updates without a big plan won’t help you really succeed. 

Running a company is a weird place for someone who always thinks positively. Why would you think your business will do well without a solid plan? While Darwin's ideas about survival are cool in some situations, having a smart design is what really works best for startups.
