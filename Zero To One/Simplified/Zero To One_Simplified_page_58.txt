Being lean is a way of doing things, not just a goal to reach. Making small changes to what you already have might help you improve a little, but it won't help you reach your full potential. 

For example, you could create an awesome app that lets people order toilet paper from their iPhones. But just making small updates won't take you from nothing to something great. 

Running a business is a weird place for someone who is always super positive. Why would you think your business will succeed without a solid plan? While survival of the fittest is a good idea in some situations, having a smart plan works best for startups.
