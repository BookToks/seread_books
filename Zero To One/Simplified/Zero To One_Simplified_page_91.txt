WHAT’S UNDER SILICON VALLEY’S HOODIES

When you look at a tech company, everyone seems different but actually has something in common. Unlike people on the East Coast who wear the same skinny jeans or suits, young workers in Mountain View and Palo Alto show up in T-shirts. It’s a stereotype that tech workers don’t care about their clothes, but if you check out those T-shirts, you’ll notice they have their company logos on them. Tech workers really care about those logos. What makes a startup employee easy to spot is the branded T-shirt or hoodie that makes them look like their coworkers. This startup outfit shows a simple idea: everyone at your company should be different in the same way, like a group of people who are super dedicated to the company’s goals.

Max Levchin, who helped start PayPal with me, believes that startups should hire people who are similar to each other. Startups don’t have a lot of money and usually have small teams. They need to work fast and well to survive, and it’s easier when everyone sees things the same way. The early PayPal team got along well because we were all nerds who loved science fiction. We all read the book Cryptonomicon and liked the capitalist Star Wars more than the communist Star Trek. Most importantly, we were all really into creating a digital currency that people could control instead of the government. It didn’t matter what we looked like or where we were from; we just needed every new person to share that same passion.
