WHAT’S UNDER SILICON VALLEY’S HOODIES

When you look at people in tech companies, they all seem different but actually share a lot in common. Unlike folks on the East Coast who wear similar outfits like skinny jeans or suits, young people in places like Mountain View and Palo Alto usually wear T-shirts to work. It’s a common idea that tech workers don’t care about their clothes, but if you check out those T-shirts, you’ll see the logos of their companies, which they care about a lot. What makes someone from a startup easy to spot is their branded T-shirt or hoodie, which makes them look like everyone else at the company. This startup uniform shows a simple but important idea: everyone at the company should be different in the same way, like a group of friends who are really dedicated to the company’s goals.

Max Levchin, who helped start PayPal with me, believes that startups should hire people who are similar to each other. Startups don’t have a lot of money and usually have small teams. They need to work fast and well to stay alive, and it’s easier when everyone sees things the same way. The early PayPal team got along great because we were all nerds who loved science fiction. We all read the book Cryptonomicon, and we liked the capitalist Star Wars more than the communist Star Trek. Most importantly, we were all super focused on creating a digital currency that people could control instead of the government. It didn’t matter how people looked or where they were from; we just needed every new person to be just as passionate.
