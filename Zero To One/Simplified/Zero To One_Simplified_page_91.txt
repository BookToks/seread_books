WHAT’S UNDER SILICON VALLEY’S HOODIES

From the outside, everyone in a tech company looks pretty similar. 

Unlike people on the East Coast, who often wear the same skinny jeans or fancy suits based on their job, young workers in Mountain View and Palo Alto show up in T-shirts. It’s a common idea that tech workers don’t care about their clothes, but if you take a closer look at those T-shirts, you’ll see the logos of their companies—and they care a lot about those logos. What makes a startup worker easy to spot is the branded T-shirt or hoodie that makes them look like their coworkers. This startup uniform shows a simple but important idea: everyone at your company should be different in the same way, like a group of people who really believe in the company’s goals.

Max Levchin, who helped start PayPal with me, says that startups should try to make their early team members as similar as possible. Startups don’t have a lot of money and have small teams. They need to work fast and smart to survive, and it’s easier to do that when everyone sees things in a similar way. The early PayPal team got along well because we were all the same kind of nerd. We all loved science fiction: reading Cryptonomicon was a must, and we liked the capitalist Star Wars more than the communist Star Trek. Most importantly, we were all really into creating a digital currency that people could control instead of governments. For the company to succeed, it didn’t matter what people looked like or where they came from, but we needed every new hire to be just as passionate.
