Palantir’s software helps find terrorists and predict where insurgents hide explosives in Afghanistan. It has also helped with big insider trading cases, shut down the largest child pornography ring in the world, and assisted the CDC in fighting food-related diseases. Plus, it saves banks and the government a lot of money every year by detecting fraud.

While the software is advanced, the real heroes are the people using it—analysts, lawyers, scientists, and financial experts. Without their skills, the software wouldn’t be effective. 

Think about what professionals do today. Lawyers need to explain solutions in different ways depending on who they're talking to, like clients or judges. Doctors must understand medical stuff and explain it clearly to patients. Good teachers know their subjects well but also adapt their teaching to fit different students’ needs. Computers can help with some of these tasks, but they can’t do everything perfectly.

Better technology in fields like law, medicine, and education won’t replace professionals; it will help them do even more. 

LinkedIn is a great example of this for recruiters. When it started in 2003, it didn’t ask recruiters what they needed or try to replace them with software. Recruiting is like being a detective and a salesperson—you have to look closely at applicants, understand their motives, and convince the best ones to join. It’s impossible to replace all that with a computer. Instead, LinkedIn changed how recruiters work. Now, over 97% of recruiters use LinkedIn to find job candidates, and it also helps millions of professionals manage their online presence. If LinkedIn had just tried to replace recruiters, it wouldn’t be successful today.

So, why do many people not see the benefits of combining human skills with technology? It often starts in school. Software engineers usually work on projects that replace human jobs because that’s what they learn to do. Academics focus on specialized research and getting published, which means they often break down human abilities into tasks that computers can handle one at a time.

Look at popular areas in computer science today. The term “machine learning” makes people think of replacement. Many believe computers can learn to do almost anything if we give them enough data. If you’ve used Netflix or Amazon, you’ve seen this in action; they use algorithms to suggest products based on what you’ve watched or bought. The more data they have, the better the suggestions get. Google Translate works similarly, giving decent translations into many languages not because it understands language, but because it finds patterns in a lot of text.
