SUBSTITUTION VS. COMPLEMENTARITY

Fifteen years ago, American workers were worried about losing jobs to cheaper workers in Mexico. This made sense because people can replace each other in jobs. Nowadays, people think they hear Ross Perot’s “giant sucking sound” again, but this time they blame it on computer server farms in Texas instead of factories in Tijuana. Americans are scared of technology because they think it’s like the past when jobs went overseas. But the two situations are really different: people compete for jobs and resources, while computers don’t compete for those things.

Globalization Means Substitution

When Perot talked about foreign competition, both George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton supported free trade. They believed that since everyone is better at different jobs, the economy does better when people focus on what they’re good at and trade with each other. However, it’s not clear how well free trade has worked for many workers. The benefits of trade are biggest when there’s a big difference in skills, but there are many workers around the world willing to do simple jobs for very low pay.

People don’t just compete to provide labor; they also want the same resources. While American shoppers enjoy cheap toys and clothes from China, they have to pay more for gas because many new drivers in China want it too. Whether people are eating shark fins in Shanghai or fish tacos in San Diego, everyone needs food and shelter. And as globalization grows, people will want more. Now that many Chinese farmers have enough food, they want more variety, like pork instead of just grain. The rich people everywhere also want the same luxury items, like fancy champagne.

Technology Means Complementarity

Now, let’s think about competition from computers instead of from other workers. Computers are really different from people, much more than any two people are different from each other. Humans can plan and make decisions in tricky situations, but we’re not great at handling huge amounts of data. On the other hand, computers are amazing at processing data quickly but struggle with simple judgments that are easy for humans.

To see how different we are, look at a project by Google. In 2012, one of their supercomputers got attention for recognizing a cat in YouTube videos with 75% accuracy after scanning 10 million images. That sounds impressive until you realize a four-year-old can do it perfectly. When a cheap laptop can outsmart the best mathematicians at some tasks, but even a supercomputer can’t beat a child at others, it shows that humans and computers are not just different in power—they are fundamentally different.
