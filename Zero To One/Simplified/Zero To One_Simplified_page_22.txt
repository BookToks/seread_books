HAPPY COMPANIES ARE UNIQUE

The business question we should ask is: what valuable company is no one creating? This question is trickier than it seems because a company can make a lot of value but not be very valuable itself. Just making value isn’t enough—you also need to keep some of that value.

This means that even big companies can be bad at making money. For example, U.S. airlines help millions of passengers and create hundreds of billions of dollars in value every year. But in 2012, when the average ticket price was $178, airlines only made 37 cents for each passenger. In contrast, Google created less value but kept a lot more of it. In 2012, Google earned $50 billion (compared to the airlines' $160 billion) but kept 21% of that as profit—over 100 times more than what airlines made. Google is so successful that it’s worth three times more than all U.S. airlines combined.

Airlines compete with each other, but Google stands out on its own. Economists explain this difference using two simple ideas: perfect competition and monopoly. 

“Perfect competition” is seen as the best situation in Economics 101. In perfectly competitive markets, supply meets demand. Every company sells the same products, so they have no power to set prices. If there’s money to be made, new companies will join the market, increasing supply, lowering prices, and taking away the profits that attracted them. If too many companies enter, some will lose money, and prices will go back up to normal levels. In the long run, no company makes a profit in perfect competition.

On the other hand, a monopoly is when one company controls the market and can set its own prices. Since there’s no competition, it can produce what it wants to maximize profits. Economists see all monopolies as similar, whether they push out rivals, get government support, or innovate. In this book, we’re focusing on companies that are so good at what they do that no one else can compete closely. 

Google is a great example of a company that went from nothing to being the best. Since the early 2000s, it hasn’t really competed in search engines because it set itself apart from Microsoft and Yahoo! 

People often think competition is great and saves us from bad situations. But actually, capitalism and competition are different. Capitalism is about making money, but in perfect competition, all profits disappear. The lesson for entrepreneurs is clear: if you want to create and keep lasting value, don’t build a business that’s just like everyone else’s.
