ALL HAPPY COMPANIES ARE DIFFERENT

The business version of our tricky question is: what valuable company is nobody starting? This question is tougher than it seems because a company can create a lot of value without being super valuable itself. Just making value isn’t enough—you also need to keep some of that value for yourself.

This means that even big companies can be bad at making money. For example, U.S. airlines help millions of passengers and create tons of value every year. But in 2012, when the average ticket price was $178, the airlines only made 37 cents for each passenger trip. In comparison, Google creates less overall value but keeps a lot more of it. Google made $50 billion in 2012 (compared to the airlines' $160 billion), but it kept 21% of that as profit—over 100 times more than the airlines made that year. Google makes so much money that it’s now worth three times more than all U.S. airlines combined.

The airlines compete with each other, but Google stands out on its own. Economists use two simple ideas to explain the difference: perfect competition and monopoly.

“Perfect competition” is seen as the best and most basic idea in Economics 101. In perfectly competitive markets, everything balances out when what producers supply meets what consumers want. Every company in a competitive market is the same and sells the same products. Since no company has any power in the market, they have to sell at whatever price the market decides. If there’s money to be made, new companies will jump in, increase supply, lower prices, and take away the profits that attracted them in the first place. If too many companies enter the market, they’ll lose money, some will go out of business, and prices will go back up to normal levels. In perfect competition, no company makes a profit in the long run.

On the other hand, a monopoly is the opposite of perfect competition. A monopoly controls its market, so it can set its own prices. Since there’s no competition, it produces at the amount and price that makes it the most money.

To an economist, every monopoly looks the same, whether it gets rid of competitors, gets a special license from the government, or works hard to be the best. In this book, we’re not talking about illegal bullies or government favorites: when we say “monopoly,” we mean a company that’s so good at what it does that no other company can offer anything close. 

Google is a great example of a company that went from nothing to everything: it hasn’t really competed in search since the early 2000s, when it clearly pulled ahead of Microsoft and Yahoo!

People in America often celebrate competition and say it saves us from bad situations. But actually, capitalism and competition are opposites. Capitalism is all about building wealth, but in perfect competition, all profits get wiped out. The lesson for entrepreneurs is clear: if you want to create and keep lasting value, don’t start a business that’s just like everyone else’s.
