He will own a small part of the company’s stock, but it’s not a big deal. So, he’s more likely to reward himself by owning things instead of really caring about the company. If he shows good results every few months, he can keep his high salary and fancy corporate jet.

Problems can happen even if he gets stock as a reward for making the company look good. If he gets that stock for doing well in the short term, he might think it’s easier to cut costs instead of spending money on plans that could help everyone in the long run.

In small startups, the founders usually own and control the company. Most issues come up between the founders and the investors on the board. As time goes on, these interests can clash: a board member might want to take the company public quickly to make a profit for their firm, while the founders might want to stay private and grow the business.

In meetings, having fewer people is better. A smaller board can communicate easily, agree on things, and keep an eye on what’s happening. But because they work well together, a small board can also strongly oppose management if there’s a problem. That’s why it’s important to choose your board members carefully. Every single person on your board is important. One bad member can cause issues and even threaten the company’s future.

Having three board members is best. Your board should never have more than five people unless your company is public. Public companies have to have bigger boards because of rules—usually around nine members. Making your board too big is the worst thing you can do. When people see a nonprofit with a huge board, they think, “Wow, so many great people are involved! It must be really well run.” But actually, a big board doesn’t keep things in check; it just hides the fact that one person is really in charge. If you want your board to be effective, keep it small.
