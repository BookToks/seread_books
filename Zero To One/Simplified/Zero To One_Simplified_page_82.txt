The person will own a small part of the company’s stock, but it’s not a big deal. This means he’s more likely to reward himself by having things instead of really caring about owning the company. As long as he shows good results every few months, he can keep his high salary and fancy private jet. 

Problems can happen even if he gets stock as a reward for making the company look good. If he gets stock for short-term success, he might find it easier to cut costs instead of spending money on plans that could help the company grow in the long run. 

In contrast to big companies, small startups usually have founders who own and control the business. Conflicts often happen between the founders and the investors on the board. As time goes on, these conflicts can grow. For example, a board member might want to sell the company quickly to make a profit for their investment firm, while the founders might want to keep it private and develop it further. 

In the boardroom, having fewer people is better. A smaller board can communicate easily, agree on decisions, and keep an eye on things effectively. But this also means that a small board can strongly disagree with management during conflicts. That’s why it’s super important to pick the right board members. Just one bad director can cause problems and even threaten the company’s future. 

Having a board of three people is the best. Your board shouldn’t have more than five members unless your company is public. Public companies usually have bigger boards because of rules, with an average of nine members. The worst thing you can do is make your board too big. When people see a nonprofit with a huge board, they might think it’s well-managed. But a big board often doesn’t keep things in check; it just hides the fact that one person is really in charge. If you want a strong board, keep it small.
