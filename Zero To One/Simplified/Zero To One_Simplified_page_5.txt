Preface

ZERO TO ONE

Every moment in business is unique. The next Bill Gates won’t create another operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t build a new search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won’t launch another social network. If you’re just copying these people, you’re not really learning from them.

Sure, it’s easier to copy what others have done than to come up with something new. Doing what we already know takes us from 1 to n, adding more of what we’re familiar with. But every time we create something new, we go from 0 to 1. Creating something is special, and the moment we create it is too, resulting in something fresh and different.

If American companies don’t focus on creating new things, they will struggle in the future, no matter how much money they make now. What happens when we’ve done everything we can with the old ways of doing business? It might sound unlikely, but the outcome could be worse than the 2008 crisis. Today’s “best practices” can lead to dead ends; the best paths are often new and untested.

In a world filled with huge organizations, looking for a new way might feel impossible. But if American businesses want to succeed, we’ll need many breakthroughs. This might sound discouraging, but there’s one important fact: humans are different from other species because we can create amazing things. We call these amazing things technology.

Technology is incredible because it helps us do more with less, boosting our abilities to a higher level. Other animals instinctively build things like dams or hives, but we are the only ones who can invent new things and better ways to create them. Humans don’t just pick what to build from a list of options; by creating new technologies, we change the world’s plan. These are basic ideas we teach to young kids, but it’s easy to forget them when we often repeat what’s already been done.

Zero to One is about how to create companies that make new things. It’s based on everything I learned as a co-founder of PayPal and Palantir, and as an investor in many startups, including Facebook and SpaceX. While I’ve noticed many patterns and share them here, this book doesn’t give a step-by-step guide to success. The tricky part about teaching entrepreneurship is that there can’t be a formula for it; every innovation is new and different, so no one can tell you exactly how to be creative. The most powerful pattern I’ve seen is that successful people find value in unexpected places by thinking about business from the ground up instead of following formulas.

This book comes from a course about startups that I taught at Stanford in 2012. College students can become really good at specific skills, but many don’t learn how to use those skills in the real world. My main goal in teaching the class was to help my students see beyond their narrow studies and understand the bigger future they can create. One of those students,
