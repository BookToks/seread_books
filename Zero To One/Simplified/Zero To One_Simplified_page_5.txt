Every moment in business is unique. The next Bill Gates won’t create another operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a new search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won’t start another social network. If you just copy what these people did, you’re not really learning anything.

Sure, it’s easier to copy what’s already out there than to come up with something new. When we do what we already know, we’re just adding more of the same. But when we create something new, we’re going from nothing to something. Creating is special, and so is the moment when something new is made.

If American companies don’t focus on creating new things, they will struggle in the future, no matter how much money they make now. What happens when we’ve used up everything we can from improving old businesses? It might be worse than the 2008 crisis. Following today’s “best practices” can lead to dead ends; the best ideas are often new and untested.

In a world filled with big companies and government organizations, finding new ideas might feel impossible. But if American businesses want to succeed, we need a lot of new ideas. This might sound discouraging, but there’s a key point: humans are different from other animals because we can create amazing things. We call these amazing things technology.

Technology is incredible because it helps us do more with less, boosting our abilities. Other animals build things like dams or hives, but we’re the only ones who can invent new things and better ways to make them. We don’t just pick from a list of options; by creating new technologies, we change how the world works. These are simple truths we teach kids, but they can be easy to forget when we keep repeating what’s already been done.

"Zero to One" is about how to build companies that create new things. It shares everything I’ve learned as a co-founder of PayPal and Palantir, and as an investor in many startups, including Facebook and SpaceX. While I’ve noticed some patterns, this book doesn’t give a step-by-step guide to success. The tricky part about teaching entrepreneurship is that there can’t be a formula for it; every new idea is different and unique. The most important pattern I’ve seen is that successful people find value in unexpected places by thinking about business from the ground up, not just following formulas.

This book comes from a class I taught about startups at Stanford in 2012. College students can get really good at specific skills, but many don’t learn how to use those skills in the real world. My main goal in teaching was to help my students see beyond their specific studies and understand the bigger future they can create.
