Because globalization and technology are two different ways the world can improve, we can have both, just one, or neither at the same time. For example, from 1815 to 1914, there was a lot of new technology and globalization happening together. But between World War I and when Kissinger went to China in 1971, there was new technology but not much globalization. Since 1971, we’ve seen a lot of globalization, but only a little bit of new technology, mostly in IT.

This time of globalization makes us think that the future will be more similar everywhere. Even the way we talk shows we believe in a kind of ending for technology: we see the world split into “developed” and “developing” countries, which suggests that the developed countries have already done everything they can, and the poorer countries just need to catch up.

But I don’t think that’s right. Many people believe the future will be shaped by globalization, but I believe technology is more important. Without new technology, if China increases its energy production a lot in the next twenty years, it will also double its air pollution. If every household in India lived like Americans do today—using the same tools—the result would be a huge environmental disaster. Spreading old ways of making money around the world will lead to destruction, not wealth. In a world with limited resources, globalization without new technology can’t last.

New technology hasn’t always been a given in history. Our ancestors lived in societies where success meant taking from others. They rarely created new ways to make wealth, and over time, they couldn’t create enough to make life easier for most people. After thousands of years of slow progress from basic farming to medieval inventions, the modern world suddenly saw a lot of technological growth starting with the steam engine in the 1760s and lasting until about 1970.

Because of this, we have a richer society than any previous generation could have imagined, except for our parents and grandparents. In the late 1960s, they expected...
