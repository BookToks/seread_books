The big differences between people and computers mean that we can get way more benefits from using computers than we do from trading with other people. We don’t really trade with computers like we do with animals or lamps. That’s the main idea: computers are tools we use, not our enemies.

The differences get even bigger when we think about what computers want. Unlike people in developing countries, computers don’t crave fancy food or nice houses; they just need a little electricity, and they don’t even know they need it. When we create new computer technology to help us solve problems, we get all the benefits of having a super-specialized partner without having to fight for the same resources. If we understand it right, technology is our way to avoid competition in a world that’s becoming more connected. As computers get stronger, they won’t replace us; they will work alongside us.
