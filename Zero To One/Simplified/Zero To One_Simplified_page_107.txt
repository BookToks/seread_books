The big differences between people and machines mean that working with computers gives us way more benefits than trading with other people. We don’t really trade with computers like we do with animals or lamps. That’s the main idea: computers are tools we use, not things we compete against.

The differences go even deeper when we think about what computers need. Unlike people in countries that are developing, computers don’t want fancy food or nice houses; they just need a little bit of electricity, and they don’t even know they need it. When we create new computer technology to help us solve problems, we get all the benefits of a super-specialized trading partner without having to fight over resources. If we understand it correctly, technology is our way to avoid competition in a world that’s becoming more global. As computers get stronger, they won’t replace humans; they will work alongside us.
