SECRETS

Every famous idea we know today was once a mystery. For example, the math behind a triangle's sides was a secret for a long time. Pythagoras had to really think to figure it out. If you wanted to learn about his discovery, the best way was to join his weird vegetarian group. Now, we teach his geometry to little kids. 

These common truths are important, like basic math, but they won’t give you an advantage. They’re not secrets. 

Think about this question: what important truth do very few people agree with you on? If we already know everything there is to know about the world, and if all the ideas we have are already smart, then there aren’t many good answers. Thinking differently only makes sense if there are still secrets to uncover. 

There are definitely things we don’t understand yet, but some of those might be impossible to figure out—like mysteries instead of secrets. For example, string theory talks about the universe using tiny vibrating strings. Is string theory true? You can’t really test it with experiments, and very few people could ever fully understand it. But is it just hard to grasp, or is it an impossible mystery? That difference is important. You can achieve hard things, but you can’t achieve the impossible. 

Now think about the business side of our question: what valuable company is nobody starting? Every right answer is a secret: something important that’s unknown and hard to do but possible. If there are still many secrets in the world, there are likely many game-changing companies that haven’t been created yet. This chapter will help you think about secrets and how to find them.
