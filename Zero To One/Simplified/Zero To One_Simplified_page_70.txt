SECRETS

Every famous idea we know today was once a mystery. For example, the relationship between a triangle’s sides was a secret for a long time. Pythagoras had to really think to figure it out. If you wanted to learn about his discovery, you had to join his weird vegetarian group. Now, we teach his geometry to kids in school. 

This kind of knowledge is important, like basic math, but it’s not a secret anymore. 

Think about this question: what important truth do very few people agree with you on? If we already know everything there is to know about the world, and if all ideas are already figured out, then there aren’t many good answers. Thinking against the crowd only makes sense if there are still secrets to uncover. 

There are definitely things we don’t understand yet, but some of them might be impossible to figure out—like mysteries instead of secrets. For instance, string theory talks about the universe using tiny vibrating strings. Is string theory true? You can’t really test it with experiments, and not many people can understand everything about it. But is it just hard to grasp, or is it truly impossible? That’s an important difference. You can achieve hard things, but you can’t achieve what’s impossible. 

Now, think about the business side of our question: what valuable company is nobody creating? Every right answer is a secret: something important that’s not known yet, something tough but possible to do. If there are still many secrets out there, there could be many game-changing companies waiting to be started. This chapter will help you think about secrets and how to find them.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** Secrets are ideas that were once unknown but are now common knowledge. There are still many mysteries and potential secrets in the world, especially in business, that can lead to new discoveries and companies. This chapter encourages thinking about these hidden truths.
