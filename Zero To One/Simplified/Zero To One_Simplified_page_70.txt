SECRETS

Every famous idea we know today was once a mystery. For example, the math behind a triangle's sides was a secret for a long time. Pythagoras had to really think to figure it out. If you wanted to learn about his discovery, you had to join his weird vegetarian group. Now, his geometry is something we teach to kids in school. While basic math is important, it’s not a secret anymore.

Think about this question: what important truth do very few people agree with you on? If we already know everything there is to know about the world, then there aren’t any good answers. Thinking differently only makes sense if there are still secrets out there to uncover.

There are still many things we don’t understand, but some might be impossible to figure out—like mysteries instead of secrets. For instance, string theory talks about how the universe works using tiny, vibrating strings. Is string theory true? You can’t really test it with experiments, and very few people can grasp all its ideas. But is it just hard to understand, or is it impossible? That difference is important. You can achieve hard things, but you can’t achieve the impossible.

Now, think about the business side: what valuable company is nobody starting? Every correct answer is a secret—something important and unknown, something tough but possible to do. If there are still secrets in the world, there are likely many game-changing companies waiting to be created. This chapter will help you think about secrets and how to find them.
