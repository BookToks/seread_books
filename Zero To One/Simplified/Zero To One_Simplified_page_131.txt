Where do these weird and extreme traits come from? They might be there from the start (nature) or picked up from the world around them (nurture). But maybe the founders arenâ€™t as extreme as they seem. Could they be making some traits seem bigger than they really are? Or maybe everyone else is making them seem more extreme? All of these things can happen together, and when they do, they really boost each other. The cycle often begins with unique people and ends with them acting and looking even more unique.
