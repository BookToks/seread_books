Where do these weird and extreme traits come from? They might be there from the start (nature) or picked up from the environment around them (nurture). 

But maybe the founders arenâ€™t as extreme as they look. Could they be making certain traits seem bigger than they really are? Or is it that everyone else is making them seem more extreme? 

All of these things can happen at the same time, and when they do, they really boost each other. The cycle usually begins with unique people and ends with them acting and looking even more unique.
