WHY AREN’T PEOPLE LOOKING FOR SECRETS?  
Most people act like there are no secrets left to discover. A good example of this is Ted Kaczynski, known as the Unabomber. He was a child genius who started college at Harvard when he was just 16. He got a PhD in math and became a professor at UC Berkeley. But you probably only know him because he carried out a 17-year campaign of terror using pipe bombs against professors, tech experts, and businesspeople.

In late 1995, no one knew who the Unabomber was or where he was hiding. The biggest clue was a huge 35,000-word letter he wrote and sent to the media. The FBI asked some big newspapers to publish it, hoping someone would recognize it. It worked: Kaczynski’s brother saw the writing style and turned him in.

You might think the writing would be crazy, but it was actually pretty clear. Kaczynski said that to be happy, people need to have goals that take effort to achieve and succeed in reaching some of those goals. He split human goals into three types:  
1. Goals that are easy to achieve;  
2. Goals that take a lot of effort;  
3. Goals that can never be achieved, no matter how hard you try.  

This is the classic idea of easy, hard, and impossible goals. Kaczynski believed that people today are unhappy because all the tough problems have already been solved. What’s left to do is either easy or impossible, and chasing those tasks doesn’t feel rewarding. What you can do is something even a kid can do; what you can’t do is something even a genius couldn’t do. So, Kaczynski thought the solution was to destroy current systems, eliminate technology, and let people start fresh to tackle hard problems again.

Kaczynski’s actions were extreme, but his loss of faith in technology is something we see everywhere. Think about the trendy things in cities: old-school photography, handlebar mustaches, and vinyl records all remind us of a time when people were hopeful about the future. If it seems like everything important has already been done, you might as well pretend you don’t care about success and just work at a coffee shop.
