OWNERSHIP, POSSESSION, AND CONTROL

It’s not just the founders who need to get along. Everyone in your company should work well together.

Some people in Silicon Valley think the best way to fix problems is to run a business all by yourself. They believe that if you work alone, everything will be in sync. But the downside is that it limits what kind of company you can create. It’s really tough to grow a business from nothing without a team.

Others believe that you can have perfect teamwork if you hire the right people who can work well without strict rules. They think that a little chaos at work can help shake things up and change old ways of doing things. But the truth is, people aren’t perfect. That’s why leaders and boards of directors have different jobs; it’s also why the roles of founders and investors in a company are clearly defined. You need good people who get along, but you also need a solid structure to keep everyone on the same page for the long run.

To understand where things might go wrong in a company, it helps to know three key ideas:

- Ownership: who legally owns the company?
- Possession: who runs the company day-to-day?
- Control: who makes the big decisions for the company?

In a typical startup, ownership is shared among founders, employees, and investors. The managers and workers who run the company have possession. And a board of directors, usually made up of founders and investors, has control.

In theory, this setup should work well. Sharing ownership attracts investors and rewards workers. Having possession helps founders and employees get things done. The board’s oversight gives managers a bigger picture. But in real life, having different people in these roles can lead to problems.

To see how misalignment can be really bad, think about the DMV. If you need a new driver’s license, it should be simple to get one. The DMV is a government agency, and we live in a democracy where people elect representatives to help them. As a citizen, you technically own part of the DMV, and your representatives are supposed to control it, so you should be able to walk in and get what you need.

But that’s not how it works. Even though we “own” the DMV, it feels like that ownership doesn’t really matter. The clerks who work there have real power over the process. Even the governor and lawmakers who are supposed to control the DMV can’t really change anything. The system moves slowly and doesn’t listen to anyone. DMV workers can make your experience great or terrible based on their mood. You can try to remind them that you’re the boss, but that probably won’t help you get better service.

Big companies are better than the DMV, but they still face misalignment, especially between ownership and possession. For example, the CEO of a large company like General Motors…
