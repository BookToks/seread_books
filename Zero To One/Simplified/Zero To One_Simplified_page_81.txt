OWNERSHIP, POSSESSION, AND CONTROL

It's not just the founders who need to get along. Everyone in your company should work well together.

Some people in Silicon Valley might think the best way to solve this problem is to run the business all by yourself. While it might seem like working alone keeps everything in line, it also makes it hard to grow your company. You really need a team to go from nothing to something.

Others might believe that if you hire the right people, everything will run smoothly without strict rules. They think that a little chaos can help shake things up and change the way business is done. But the truth is, people aren't perfect. That's why leaders and board members have different jobs. It's also why the roles of founders and investors in a company are clearly defined. You need good people who get along, but you also need some structure to keep everyone on the same page for the long run.

To understand where problems might come from in a company, it's helpful to know three key ideas:

- Ownership: Who legally owns the company?
- Possession: Who runs the company day-to-day?
- Control: Who makes the big decisions for the company?

In a typical startup, ownership is shared among founders, employees, and investors. The managers and workers who run the company have possession. A board of directors, usually made up of founders and investors, has control.

In theory, this setup should work well. Sharing ownership can attract and reward investors and workers. When managers and employees have possession, they can get things done. The board helps keep everything in perspective. But in reality, having different people in these roles can lead to confusion and problems.

To see how misalignment can get really bad, think about going to the DMV. If you need a new driver's license, it should be easy to get one. The DMV is a government agency, and we live in a democracy where the people have power. If you're a citizen, you technically own the DMV, and your elected officials control it, so you should be able to walk in and get what you need.

But it doesn't work that way. While we may "own" the DMV's resources, that ownership doesn't really mean much. The clerks who work there have real power over the process. Even the governor and lawmakers who are supposed to control the DMV can't change how it operates. The system moves slowly and doesn't really listen to anyone. Bureaucrats can make your experience good or terrible based on their mood. You can try to remind them that you have a say, but that probably won't help you get better service.

Big companies do a bit better than the DMV, but they can still have issues, especially between ownership and possession. For example, the CEO of a big company like General Motors...
