MANIA: SEPTEMBER 1998–MARCH 2000

Dot-com mania was a wild time that lasted for about 18 months, from September 1998 to March 2000. It was like a gold rush in Silicon Valley, where money was everywhere and lots of excited, sometimes shady people were trying to grab it. Every week, new startups were competing to throw the biggest and most extravagant launch parties. (Real parties were much rarer.) 

People who suddenly became millionaires would go out for fancy dinners and try to pay with their startup’s stock—sometimes it actually worked! Many people left their good jobs to start or join these new companies. I knew a guy in his 40s who was running six different companies in 1999. (Usually, being a 40-year-old grad student is seen as odd, and starting six companies at once is considered crazy. But back in the late ’90s, people thought it was a smart move.)

Everyone should have realized that this craziness couldn’t last forever. The so-called “successful” companies often had a strange way of doing business where they lost money even as they grew. But it’s hard to blame people for having fun while the excitement lasted; it made sense to act that way when just adding “.com” to your name could make your company worth twice as much overnight.
