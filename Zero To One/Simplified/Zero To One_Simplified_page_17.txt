MANIA: SEPTEMBER 1998–MARCH 2000

Dot-com mania was crazy but didn’t last long—just 18 months from September 1998 to March 2000. It was like a gold rush in Silicon Valley: there was money everywhere, and lots of excited, sometimes shady people trying to grab it. Every week, tons of new startups were competing to throw the biggest launch parties. (Big parties for established companies were much less common.) People who suddenly became millionaires would rack up huge dinner bills and try to pay with shares of their startup’s stock—sometimes it actually worked!

Many people left their good jobs to start or join these new companies. I knew a 40-year-old grad student who was running six different companies in 1999. (It’s usually seen as strange to be a 40-year-old grad student. It’s even crazier to start six companies at the same time. But back in the late ’90s, people thought it could actually work.) Everyone should have realized that this excitement couldn’t last forever; the so-called “successful” companies often lost money while growing. But it’s tough to blame people for having fun when things were so wild; it made sense to act irrationally since just adding “.com” to your name could make you twice as valuable overnight.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** The dot-com mania from September 1998 to March 2000 was a wild time in Silicon Valley, where many startups emerged, and people left stable jobs to chase quick riches. Despite the craziness and unsustainable business models, the excitement led many to believe they could succeed just by being part of the tech boom.
