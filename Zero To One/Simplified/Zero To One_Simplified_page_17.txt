MANIA: SEPTEMBER 1998–MARCH 2000

The dot-com mania was crazy but lasted only 18 months, from September 1998 to March 2000. It was like a gold rush in Silicon Valley, where money was everywhere, and lots of excited, sometimes sketchy people were trying to grab it. Every week, tons of new startups were competing to throw the biggest and most extravagant launch parties. (Landing parties were much rarer.) 

People who suddenly became millionaires would rack up huge dinner bills and try to pay with shares of their startup’s stock—sometimes it actually worked. Many people left their good jobs to start or join these new companies. I knew a guy in his 40s who was running six different companies in 1999. (Usually, it’s seen as strange for a 40-year-old to be a grad student, and starting six companies at once is considered insane. But back in the late ’90s, people thought it could actually work.) 

Everyone should have realized that this excitement couldn’t last forever; the so-called “successful” companies often had a weird way of doing business where they lost money while growing. But it’s hard to blame people for having fun when everything seemed so great; it made sense to act irrationally when just adding “.com” to your name could double your worth overnight.
