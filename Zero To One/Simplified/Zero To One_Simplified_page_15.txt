A QUICK HISTORY OF THE ’90S

The 1990s are often seen as a great time. We remember it as a happy decade that ended with the rise and fall of the internet. But many parts of those years weren't as fun as we think. We've forgotten what was happening globally during the crazy dot-com period at the end of the decade.

The ’90s kicked off with excitement when the Berlin Wall fell in November 1989. But that good feeling didn’t last long. By mid-1990, the U.S. was in a recession. Technically, the recession ended in March 1991, but recovery was slow, and unemployment kept rising until July 1992. The manufacturing industry never fully bounced back, and the shift to a service economy was tough.

From 1992 to the end of 1994, people felt pretty down. News showed images of American soldiers dying in Mogadishu, and there was a lot of worry about jobs moving to Mexico. This negative vibe helped push President Bush out of office and allowed Ross Perot to get nearly 20% of the votes in 1992, which was the best for a third-party candidate since Theodore Roosevelt in 1912. Even though people were into bands like Nirvana and the grunge scene, it didn’t bring much hope.

Silicon Valley wasn’t doing too well either. Japan seemed to be winning in tech, especially with semiconductors. The internet wasn’t popular yet because it was mostly for research until late 1992, and there weren’t many easy-to-use web browsers. When I got to Stanford in 1985, most students were studying economics, not computer science. To many, tech felt strange and not very important.

Then the internet changed everything. The Mosaic browser came out in November 1993, allowing regular people to go online. Mosaic later became Netscape, which launched its Navigator browser in late 1994. Navigator grew super fast, going from about 20% of the browser market in January 1995 to almost 80% in less than a year. This success let Netscape go public in August 1995, even though it wasn’t making money yet. Within five months, its stock price jumped from $28 to $174 per share. Other tech companies were also doing great. Yahoo! went public in April 1996 with a value of $848 million, and Amazon followed in May 1997 at $438 million. By spring 1998, both companies’ stocks had more than quadrupled. Some people doubted the high stock prices, thinking the market was going wild.

This worry was understandable but not entirely correct. In December 1996, more than three years before the bubble burst, the head of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, warned that “irrational exuberance” might have pushed prices too high. Tech investors were excited, but it’s hard to say they were being unreasonable. It’s easy to forget that things weren’t great in other parts of the world back then.

In July 1997, the East Asian financial crisis hit. Countries like Thailand, Indonesia, and South Korea faced huge economic problems due to bad practices and massive debt. Then in August 1998, Russia faced its own crisis when it devalued its currency and defaulted on its debt. American investors got nervous about a country with nuclear weapons and no money, causing the Dow Jones Industrial Average to drop more than 10% in just a few days.

People were right to be concerned. The ruble crisis led to problems for Long-Term Capital Management, a U.S. hedge fund that lost $4.6 billion in late 1998 and had over $100 billion in debts. The Federal Reserve had to step in with a huge bailout and cut interest rates to prevent a major disaster. Europe wasn’t doing well either.
