WAR AND PEACE

Professors often downplay how competitive school can be, but business leaders love to compare business to war. MBA students carry around books by famous military thinkers like Clausewitz and Sun Tzu. 

We use war-related words in our everyday business talk. For example, we talk about using headhunters to build a sales team that can capture a market and make a lot of money. But really, it’s competition that feels like war: it seems necessary and brave, but it usually ends up causing a lot of damage.

Why do people compete? Marx and Shakespeare give us two ways to understand almost any conflict. According to Marx, people fight because they are different. The working class fights the upper class because they have totally different ideas and goals, which come from their different life situations. The bigger the differences, the bigger the fights.

On the other hand, Shakespeare thinks that everyone involved in a fight is pretty similar. It’s not clear why they are even fighting since they don’t have real reasons. For example, in Romeo and Juliet, he says, “Two households, both alike in dignity.” The two families are similar, yet they hate each other. As their feud grows, they become even more alike and forget why they started fighting in the first place.

In business, Shakespeare’s view seems to fit better. Inside a company, people get really focused on competing with each other for promotions. Then, companies start to obsess over their rivals in the market. In all this drama, people forget what really matters and just focus on beating their competitors.

Let’s see how this Shakespearean idea plays out in real life. Imagine a show called Gates and Schmidt, based on Romeo and Juliet. Montague is Microsoft, and Capulet is Google. Two big companies, led by super-smart people, are bound to clash because they are so similar.

Like in any good tragedy, the conflict seems unavoidable when we look back. But really, it could have been avoided. These companies came from different backgrounds. Montague made operating systems and office software, while Capulet created a search engine. What was there to fight about?

Apparently, a lot. When they were smaller, each company was happy to let the other do its own thing. But as they grew, they started to focus on each other. Montagues worried about Capulets, and Capulets worried about Montagues. This led to battles like Windows vs. Chrome OS, Bing vs. Google Search, Explorer vs. Chrome, Office vs. Docs, and Surface vs. Nexus.

Just like war cost the Montagues and Capulets their kids, it also cost Microsoft and Google their top spots: Apple came along and took over. In January 2013, Apple was worth $500 billion, while Google and Microsoft together were worth $467 billion. Just three years earlier, both Microsoft and Google were worth more than Apple. War in business is expensive.

Rivalry makes us focus too much on old opportunities and copy what has worked before. For example, think about the rise of mobile credit card readers. In October 2010, a startup called Square released a small, white card reader that let anyone with an iPhone accept credit cards. It was the first good payment solution for mobile phones.

After that, many others jumped in. A Canadian company called NetSecure made a half-moon shaped card reader. Intuit created a cylindrical reader. In March 2012, eBay’s PayPal launched its own version, shaped like a triangle—a clear dig at Square, since three sides are simpler than four. It feels like this Shakespearean story won’t end until everyone runs out of shapes.
