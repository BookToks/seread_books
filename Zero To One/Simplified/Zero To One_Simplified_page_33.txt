WAR AND PEACE

Professors often downplay how competitive school can be, but business managers love to compare business to war. MBA students carry around books by Clausewitz and Sun Tzu. We use war-related words in business all the time: we have headhunters to build a strong sales team that will help us capture a market and make a lot of money. But really, it’s competition, not business, that feels like war: it seems necessary and brave, but it ends up being destructive.

So, why do people compete? Marx and Shakespeare give us two ways to think about conflict. According to Marx, people fight because they are different. The working class fights the wealthy class because they have totally different ideas and goals, which come from their different life situations. The bigger the differences, the bigger the fights.

On the other hand, Shakespeare shows that all fighters look pretty similar. It’s not clear why they’re even fighting since they don’t have a real reason. For example, in Romeo and Juliet, he starts with “Two households, both alike in dignity.” The two families are similar, yet they hate each other. As their feud grows, they become even more alike and forget why they started fighting in the first place.

In business, Shakespeare’s view makes more sense. Inside a company, people get really focused on competing with each other for promotions. Then the companies themselves get obsessed with their rivals in the market. With all this drama, people forget what really matters and just focus on their competition.

Let’s look at a real-world example using Shakespeare’s idea. Imagine a play called Gates and Schmidt, based on Romeo and Juliet. The Montagues are Microsoft, and the Capulets are Google. These two big families, led by smart leaders, are bound to clash because they are so similar. 

Like in any good tragedy, the conflict seems unavoidable in hindsight. But it could have been avoided. The Montagues made operating systems and office software, while the Capulets created a search engine. What was there to fight about?

Apparently, a lot. When they were startups, both families were fine just doing their own thing. But as they grew, they started to focus on each other. The Montagues worried about the Capulets, and the Capulets worried about the Montagues. This led to battles like Windows vs. Chrome OS, Bing vs. Google Search, Explorer vs. Chrome, Office vs. Docs, and Surface vs. Nexus.

Just like war cost the Montagues and Capulets their kids, it cost Microsoft and Google their top spots: Apple came in and took over. In January 2013, Apple was worth $500 billion, while Google and Microsoft together were worth $467 billion. Just three years earlier, both Microsoft and Google were worth more than Apple. War is an expensive game.

Rivalry makes us focus too much on past successes and copy what has worked before. Take the rise of mobile credit card readers, for example. In October 2010, a startup called Square launched a small, white card reader that let anyone with an iPhone accept credit cards. It was the first good mobile payment solution. Soon, other companies jumped in. A Canadian company called NetSecure made a half-moon shaped reader. Intuit created a cylindrical one. In March 2012, eBay’s PayPal introduced its own version shaped like a triangle—a clear shot at Square, since three sides are simpler than four. It feels like this Shakespearean story won’t end until everyone runs out of shapes.
