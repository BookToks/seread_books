The main point for businesses is that we really need founders. We should be more accepting of founders who might seem a bit weird or extreme because we need unique people to help companies grow and innovate.

For founders, it's important to remember that being famous or admired can quickly turn into being criticized or hated, so they need to be careful. 

Most importantly, founders shouldn’t think they are the only ones who matter. They are important because they can inspire everyone at their company to do their best work. We need unique founders, but that doesn’t mean we should idolize people who act like they don’t need anyone else. Ayn Rand, a famous writer, had some good ideas, but her heroes were unrealistic. 

There’s no perfect place to escape society, and thinking you can do everything alone isn’t a sign of strength; it shows you might be confused about how others see you. The biggest risk for a founder is believing their own hype so much that they lose touch with reality. But it’s also dangerous for a business to lose all sense of inspiration and think that being disillusioned is the same as being wise.
