The main point for businesses is that we really need founders. We should be more accepting of founders who might seem a bit weird or extreme because we need unique people to help companies grow and not just make small improvements.

For founders, it's important to remember that being popular and admired can quickly turn into being criticized or hated. So, you need to be careful about how you see yourself. 

Also, don’t think you’re more powerful than you really are. Founders matter not because they do everything alone, but because a great founder can inspire everyone at their company to do their best work. We need unique founders, but that doesn’t mean we should idolize people who think they can do everything by themselves. 

Ayn Rand, a famous writer, had some good ideas, but her heroes were not real. There’s no perfect place where you can escape society, and thinking you can do everything on your own isn’t a sign of strength; it’s a sign that you might be confused about what people really think of you. 

The biggest risk for a founder is believing their own hype so much that they lose touch with reality. But another big problem for any business is losing all sense of inspiration and thinking that being disillusioned is the same as being wise.
