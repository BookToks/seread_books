life, then it’s safer to stick to what everyone already knows. This fear of being wrong keeps people from exploring new ideas or taking chances.

Third is the rise of social media. With everyone sharing their opinions online, it feels like there’s no room for anything different. If you say something that goes against the popular view, you might get attacked or ignored. So, many people just stick to what’s popular and avoid the hard questions.

Lastly, there’s a focus on instant gratification. We want quick answers and solutions, so we don’t take the time to dig deeper. This makes it hard to appreciate the complex truths that take time to understand.
