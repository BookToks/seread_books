life, then avoiding secrets is the safest bet. 

Third is the rise of social media. Everyone shares their thoughts and experiences online, making it seem like there’s nothing left to discover. If you can find everything on the internet, why bother looking for hidden truths? 

Finally, there’s the pressure to fit in. People want to be accepted, so they stick to popular opinions and avoid challenging ideas. This makes it hard to explore deeper questions or think outside the box. 

So, with all these factors, it’s no wonder many think there are no big secrets left to uncover. The world feels pretty known, and exploring the unknown seems less important than just fitting in and getting good grades.
