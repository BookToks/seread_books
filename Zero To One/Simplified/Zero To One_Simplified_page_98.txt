HOW TO SELL A PRODUCT

Great sales and distribution can make a company the only one in its market, even if its product is similar to others. But if you have a great product that people love right away, you still need a solid plan to get it to customers.

To have effective distribution, you need to keep two things in mind. First, the total profit you make from a customer over time (Customer Lifetime Value, or CLV) should be more than what you spend to get a new customer (Customer Acquisition Cost, or CAC). Usually, if your product is more expensive, you’ll need to spend more to sell it, but that can be worth it.

When it comes to selling, there are different levels of complexity. 

If your average sale is a million dollars or more, you need to pay close attention to every detail. Building the right relationships can take months, and you might only make a sale once every year or two. After the sale, you’ll also need to help with installation and support for a long time. This “complex sales” approach is necessary for selling really valuable products.

SpaceX is a great example of this. Elon Musk got NASA to sign billion-dollar contracts to use SpaceX rockets instead of the old space shuttle. This wasn’t easy because politics plays a big role in big deals. SpaceX has over 3,000 employees, while the traditional U.S. aerospace industry has more than 500,000 workers across the country. Politicians want to keep federal money in their areas, but since complex sales only need a few deals each year, someone like Elon Musk can focus on the key people and push through any political challenges.

Complex sales work best when there aren’t traditional salespeople involved. At Palantir, the data analytics company I started with my law school friend Alex Karp, we don’t have anyone whose job is just to sell. Instead, Alex, who is the CEO, spends most of his time meeting with clients. Our deals can be worth between $1 million and $100 million, and at that level, buyers prefer to talk to the CEO rather than a sales manager.

Businesses that use complex sales models can do well if they grow by 50% to 100% each year over ten years. This might seem slow to someone hoping for quick success. You might think revenue should jump ten times as soon as people hear about a great product, but it takes time.
