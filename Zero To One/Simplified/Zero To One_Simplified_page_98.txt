HOW TO SELL A PRODUCT

Great sales and distribution can make a company the only choice for a product, even if the product itself isn’t very different from others. But just having a good product isn’t enough. Even if people love your product right away, you still need a solid plan to get it out there.

Two important numbers help you figure out if your distribution is working. The first is Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), which is how much money you make from a customer over time. The second is Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), which is how much you spend to get a new customer. Ideally, your CLV should be higher than your CAC. Usually, if your product costs more, you’ll need to spend more to sell it, but that can be worth it.

When it comes to complex sales, if your average sale is really high, like over a million dollars, you need to pay close attention to every detail. Building relationships can take a long time, and you might only make a sale once every year or two. After that, you’ll need to help with installation and service for a long time. This type of selling is tough, but it’s necessary for selling high-value products.

SpaceX is a great example of this. Elon Musk got NASA to sign huge contracts for new rockets just a few years after starting his company. But getting those big deals isn’t easy because politics play a big role. SpaceX has over 3,000 employees, while the traditional aerospace industry has more than 500,000 across the country. Politicians don’t want to lose funding for their areas. However, since complex sales only need a few deals each year, someone like Musk can focus on the key people and push through any political obstacles.

Complex sales work best when there aren’t traditional salespeople involved. For example, my company Palantir doesn’t have anyone dedicated to selling. Instead, our CEO, Alex, spends most of his time meeting clients. Our deals can be worth between $1 million and $100 million, and at that level, buyers want to talk directly to the CEO, not a sales manager.

Businesses that use complex sales models can do well if they grow 50% to 100% every year for ten years. This might seem slow to entrepreneurs who want quick success. You might think revenue would skyrocket once people discover a great product, but it often takes time.
