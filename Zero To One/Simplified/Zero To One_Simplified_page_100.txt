Small business owners aren’t slow or lacking good tools; the real problem is how products get to customers. 

Marketing and advertising work well for cheap products that lots of people want but don’t spread easily. For example, Procter & Gamble can’t send people to sell laundry detergent door-to-door. Instead, they focus on selling to grocery stores and big retailers, since one sale to them can lead to selling tons of detergent. To reach regular customers, companies make TV ads, print coupons in newspapers, and design eye-catching product boxes.

Startups can use advertising too, but it only makes sense when the cost of getting new customers is high. Take Warby Parker, for instance. They sell stylish prescription glasses online instead of using retail stores. Each pair costs about $100, and since customers usually buy several pairs over time, the company makes a good profit. However, spending a lot of time on each sale isn’t practical. Instead, Warby Parker runs ads and creates fun TV commercials to reach many glasses-wearers. They say on their website that “TV is a great big megaphone,” and when you can only spend a little to get new customers, you need the biggest megaphone possible.

Every business owner wishes they could have a famous ad campaign, but new companies shouldn’t try to compete with bigger ones for the best TV ads or PR stunts. I learned this the hard way at PayPal. We hired James Doohan, who played Scotty in Star Trek, to promote our software. We thought it would be cool to have him at an event, but it didn’t go well. The journalists who came weren’t impressed. We thought Scotty was more credible than Captain Kirk, who was always showing off. We were wrong. When Priceline.com used William Shatner (Kirk) in their ads, it worked for them because they were already a big company. No small startup can match the advertising budgets of major companies.

A product is viral if it encourages users to invite their friends. This is how Facebook and PayPal grew quickly: every time someone shares or makes a payment, they invite more people. This method is not just cheap; it’s also fast. If each new user brings in more users, you can see rapid growth. The best viral loop should be quick and easy. Funny YouTube videos or memes go viral because they spread quickly.
