EVERYBODY SELLS

Some people think that salespeople are annoying and wish they could just disappear. We all like to think we make our own choices and that sales tactics don’t affect us. But that’s not really the case.

Everyone has something to sell, whether you work for a company, started your own business, or invest in others. This is true even if you’re just working by yourself on your computer. If you don’t see any salespeople around, guess what? You are the salesperson.
