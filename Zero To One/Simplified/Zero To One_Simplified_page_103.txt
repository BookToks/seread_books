EVERYBODY SELLS

Some people might think that selling stuff is something only salespeople do and wish they could just get rid of them. We all want to believe that we make our own choices and that sales tricks don’t affect us. But that’s not the case.

Everyone has something to sell, whether you work for someone else, run your own business, or invest in companies. This is true even if it’s just you and your computer. Look around you. If you don’t see any salespeople, then guess what? You’re the salesperson.
