CASH IS NOT KING

For people to really care about their work, they need to be paid fairly. When someone asks me to invest in their business, I always want to know how much they plan to pay themselves. I’ve seen that companies do better when the CEO doesn’t take a huge salary—that’s one of the biggest things I’ve learned from investing in many startups.

A CEO of a new startup shouldn’t make more than $150,000 a year. It doesn’t matter if they used to make a lot more at a big company like Google or if they have a lot of bills to pay. If a CEO is making $300,000 a year, they might start acting more like a politician than a founder. High pay can make them focus on keeping things the same instead of working with everyone to find and fix problems. On the other hand, a CEO who doesn’t take a lot of money will work harder to make the whole company better.

When a CEO pays themselves less, it sets a good example for everyone else. Aaron Levie, the CEO of Box, always made sure to pay himself less than his employees. Even four years after starting Box, he was still living in a small, empty apartment nearby. Everyone saw how dedicated he was to the company’s goals and wanted to follow his lead. If a CEO doesn’t take the lowest salary, they can still set a good example by keeping their pay reasonable.

Cash is tempting because it gives you choices: once you get paid, you can spend it however you want. But when workers get paid a lot, they might focus on taking value from the company instead of helping it grow. A cash bonus is a bit better than a regular salary because it rewards good work. But even bonuses can make people think short-term instead of focusing on the future. Any kind of cash is more about what’s happening now than what could happen later.
