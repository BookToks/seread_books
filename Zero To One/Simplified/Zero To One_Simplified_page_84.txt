CASH IS NOT KING

For people to really care about their work, they need to be paid fairly. When someone asks me to invest in their business, I always want to know how much they plan to pay themselves. I’ve seen that companies do better when the CEO pays themselves less. 

A CEO of a new startup shouldn’t make more than $150,000 a year. It doesn’t matter if they used to make a lot more at a big company like Google or if they have a lot of bills to pay. If a CEO is making $300,000 a year, they might start acting more like a politician than a true leader. When a CEO gets paid a lot, they might focus on keeping things the same to protect their salary instead of working with everyone to solve problems. On the other hand, a CEO who doesn’t make much will work harder to make the whole company better.

When the CEO pays themselves less, it sets a good example for everyone else. Aaron Levie, the CEO of Box, always made sure to pay himself less than his employees. Even four years after starting Box, he was still living in a small, empty apartment nearby. Everyone saw how dedicated he was to the company’s goals and wanted to follow his lead.

If a CEO doesn’t take the lowest salary, they can still set a good example by keeping their pay reasonable. As long as they don’t make too much, it helps keep salaries in check.

Cash is tempting because it gives you freedom: once you get paid, you can spend it however you want. But when people get paid a lot, they might focus on taking what they can from the company instead of working hard to create new value for the future. A cash bonus is a bit better than a regular salary because it rewards good work. But even bonuses can make people think short-term and just grab what they can. Any kind of cash is more about enjoying the present than building for the future.
