THE CASE FOR SECRETS

You can’t find secrets unless you search for them. Andrew Wiles showed this when he solved Fermat’s Last Theorem after 358 years of other mathematicians trying and failing. This long struggle might have made people think it was impossible. Pierre de Fermat guessed in 1637 that there are no whole numbers a, b, and c that can make the equation a^n + b^n = c^n true for any n greater than 2. He said he had a proof, but he died without writing it down, so it stayed a big mystery in math for a long time. Wiles began working on it in 1986 but kept it a secret until 1993 when he was close to solving it. After nine years of hard work, he proved the theory in 1995. He needed to be really smart to succeed, but he also had to believe in secrets.

If you think something difficult is impossible, you won’t even try to achieve it. Believing in secrets is a powerful truth. The reality is that there are many more secrets waiting to be discovered, but they will only be found by those who keep searching. There’s still a lot to do in science, medicine, engineering, and technology. We can aim for big goals that even the smartest people from the Scientific Revolution were scared to talk about. We could find cures for cancer, dementia, and other age-related diseases. We can create new energy sources that stop conflicts over fossil fuels. We can invent faster ways to travel around the world and even learn how to leave Earth and explore new places. But we won’t discover any of these secrets unless we push ourselves to look for them.

The same idea applies to business. Amazing companies can be built on hidden secrets about how the world works. Think about the startups in Silicon Valley that found ways to use resources that everyone else ignored. Before Airbnb, travelers had to pay a lot for hotel rooms, and property owners couldn’t easily rent out their empty spaces. Airbnb saw a chance where others didn’t. The same goes for rideshare services like Lyft and Uber. Not many people thought you could create a billion-dollar business just by connecting people who need rides with drivers. We already had taxis and limousines, but only by believing in and searching for secrets could you see the opportunity that was right in front of us. 

Many internet companies, like Facebook, are often underestimated because they seem so simple. This simplicity actually supports the idea of secrets. If ideas that look basic can lead to valuable businesses, there are likely many great companies still waiting to be created.
