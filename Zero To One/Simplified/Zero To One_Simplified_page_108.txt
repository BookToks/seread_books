COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES

Humans and computers work really well together, and this is important for building a successful business. I learned this while working at PayPal. In the early 2000s, we were growing quickly after the dot-com crash, but we had a big problem: we were losing over $10 million every month to credit card fraud. Since we were handling so many transactions every minute, it was impossible for people to check each one quickly enough.

So, like any group of engineers, we tried to automate the solution. Max Levchin put together a team of smart mathematicians to look closely at the fraud cases. We used what we learned to create software that could automatically find and cancel fake transactions in real time. But soon, we realized this wouldn’t work either. After a little while, the criminals figured out how to beat our system. They were changing their tricks faster than our software could keep up.

The fraudsters were good at avoiding our automatic detection, but our human analysts were better at spotting the scams. So, Max and his team changed the software to combine both human and computer efforts. The computer would highlight the most suspicious transactions on a user-friendly interface, and then human operators would decide if they were real or fake. Thanks to this new system, which we called “Igor” after a famous fraudster, we finally made a profit in early 2002, compared to a big loss the year before. The FBI even asked to use Igor to help catch financial criminals. Max was able to proudly say he was like “the Sherlock Holmes of the Internet Underground.”

This teamwork between people and machines helped PayPal stay alive, which allowed many small businesses to accept payments online. None of this would have worked without the combination of humans and computers, even if most people never knew about it.

After we sold PayPal in 2002, I kept thinking about how humans and computers together could do much better than either one alone. What other businesses could we create using this idea? The next year, I shared a new startup idea with my old Stanford classmate Alex Karp and software engineer Stephen Cohen: we would use the human-computer teamwork from PayPal to find terrorist networks and financial fraud. We knew the FBI was interested, so in 2004, we started Palantir, a software company that helps people make sense of different types of information. By 2014, we were on track to make $1 billion in sales, and Forbes called our software the “killer app” for helping the government find Osama bin Laden.

We can’t share specific details about that operation, but we know that neither humans nor computers alone can keep us safe. The two biggest spy agencies in America have different approaches: the CIA focuses on human spies, while the NSA relies on computers. CIA analysts have to deal with a lot of information, making it hard to spot serious threats. On the other hand, NSA computers can handle tons of data, but they can’t tell if someone is planning a terrorist attack all by themselves. Palantir tries to combine these two methods: our software looks at the data the government provides—like phone records of radical clerics or bank accounts linked to terrorist activities—and highlights suspicious actions for trained analysts to check out.
