COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES

The connection between computers and humans isn’t just a big idea; it’s also a way to create a successful business. I learned this from my time at PayPal. In the year 2000, we had made it through the dot-com crash and were growing quickly, but we had a big problem: we were losing over $10 million every month to credit card fraud. Since we were processing hundreds or even thousands of transactions every minute, it was impossible to check each one—no human team could keep up.

So, like any group of engineers, we tried to automate a solution. First, Max Levchin put together a top team of mathematicians to study the fraud closely. Then we used what we learned to create software that could automatically spot and cancel fake transactions in real time. But soon, we realized this wouldn’t work either: after a short time, the criminals would change their tricks, and our software couldn’t keep up.

The fraudsters were good at changing their methods, which fooled our automatic detection systems, but our human analysts caught on more easily. So, Max and his team redesigned the software to combine both methods: the computer would highlight the most suspicious transactions on a user-friendly interface, and human operators would decide if they were real or fake. Thanks to this new system, which we named “Igor” after a clever fraudster, we made our first profit in early 2002, compared to a loss of $29.3 million the year before. The FBI even asked if they could use Igor to help catch financial criminals. Max could proudly say he was “the Sherlock Holmes of the Internet Underground.”

This teamwork between humans and machines helped PayPal stay alive, which allowed many small businesses to accept payments online. None of this would have happened without our man-machine solution, even if most people never saw or heard about it.

After we sold PayPal in 2002, I kept thinking: if humans and computers together could do much better than either could alone, what other businesses could we create using this idea? The next year, I pitched Alex Karp, a friend from Stanford, and Stephen Cohen, a software engineer, on a new startup idea: we would use the human-computer mix from PayPal’s security system to find terrorist networks and financial fraud. We knew the FBI was interested, and in 2004, we started Palantir, a software company that helps people make sense of different types of information. By 2014, the company was expected to make $1 billion in sales, and Forbes called Palantir’s software the “killer app” for its role in helping the government find Osama bin Laden.

We can’t share details about that operation, but we know that neither human intelligence nor computers alone can keep us safe. The two biggest spy agencies in America have different approaches: the CIA focuses on human spies, while the NSA relies on computers. CIA analysts have to deal with a lot of information, making it hard to find the biggest threats. NSA computers can handle tons of data, but they can’t tell if someone is planning a terrorist attack on their own. Palantir aims to combine these two methods: its software looks at the data from the government—like phone records of radical clerics or bank accounts linked to terrorist activities—and flags suspicious actions for a trained analyst to check.
