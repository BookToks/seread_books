THE IDEOLOGY OF COMPETITION

Creative monopoly means making new products that help everyone and allow the creator to make money. 

Competition, on the other hand, usually means no one makes money, nothing stands out, and everyone is just trying to survive. 

So why do people think competition is good? The truth is, competition is more than just a business idea or something annoying that people and companies deal with. It’s a way of thinking that’s everywhere in our society. We talk about competition all the time, believe it’s necessary, and follow its rules. Because of this, we get stuck in it—even though the more we compete, the less we actually gain.

This is a simple fact, but we’ve all been taught to ignore it. Our schools push this idea of competition and show how obsessed we are with it. Grades measure how competitive each student is; those with the highest scores get more respect and recognition. We teach all students the same subjects in mostly the same ways, no matter what their individual skills or interests are. Students who don’t learn best by sitting quietly at a desk feel less than others, while those who do well on tests and assignments define themselves by this strange school system.

It gets even tougher as students move up the ranks. Top students keep climbing until they reach a level of competition that crushes their dreams. College is where students who had big plans in high school find themselves in tough battles with other smart students over typical jobs like management consulting and investment banking. To be part of this, students (or their families) pay a ton of money in rising tuition costs that keep getting higher. Why do we put ourselves through this?

I wish I had thought about this when I was younger. My path was so set that in my 8th-grade yearbook, a friend predicted I would enter Stanford as a sophomore four years later, and he was right. After doing well in college, I went to Stanford Law School, where I competed even harder for the usual signs of success.

In the world of law students, the biggest prize is clear: out of thousands of graduates each year, only a few dozen get a job as a clerk for the Supreme Court. After working for a federal appeals court for a year, I got to interview for clerkships with Justices Kennedy and Scalia. My meetings with them went well. I was so close to winning this last competition. I thought if I got the clerkship, I would be set for life. But I didn’t get it, and I was really upset.

In 2004, after I built and sold PayPal, I ran into an old friend from law school who had helped me with my unsuccessful clerkship applications. We hadn’t talked in almost ten years. His first question wasn’t “How are you?” or “Can you believe it’s been so long?” Instead, he smiled and asked, “So, Peter, aren’t you glad you didn’t get that clerkship?” Looking back, we both realized that winning that big competition would have made my life worse. If I had actually worked for the Supreme Court, I probably would have spent my whole career doing boring tasks instead of creating something new. It’s hard to say how different things would be, but the missed opportunities were huge. All Rhodes Scholars had a great future in their past.
