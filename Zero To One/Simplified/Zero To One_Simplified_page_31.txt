THE IDEOLOGY OF COMPETITION

Creative monopoly means making new products that help everyone and allow the creator to earn money sustainably. Competition, on the other hand, leads to no profits for anyone, no real differences between products, and a constant fight to survive.

So why do people think competition is good? The truth is, competition isn’t just about money or a hassle that people and businesses face. It’s more like a belief system that fills our society and messes with our thinking. We talk about competition, believe we need it, and follow its rules. Because of this, we get stuck in it—even though competing often means we gain less.

This is a simple fact, but we’ve all been taught to overlook it. Our schools push and reflect our obsession with competition. Grades show exactly how competitive each student is; those with the best grades get recognition and status. We teach every student the same subjects in mostly the same ways, no matter their unique skills and interests. Students who don’t learn well by sitting quietly at a desk feel inferior, while those who do well on tests and assignments define themselves by this strange school system.

It gets even tougher as students move up the ranks. Top students climb higher until they reach a level of competition so intense that it crushes their dreams. College is where students who had big plans in high school end up competing fiercely with other smart peers for regular jobs like management consulting and investment banking. To become part of this system, students (or their families) pay huge amounts of money in tuition that keeps getting more expensive. Why are we doing this to ourselves?

I wish I had thought about this when I was younger. My path was so set that in my 8th-grade yearbook, a friend predicted I would enter Stanford as a sophomore four years later. After a typical successful college experience, I went to Stanford Law School, where I competed even harder for the usual signs of success.

In law school, the top prize is clear: out of tens of thousands of graduates each year, only a few dozen get a Supreme Court clerkship. After working for a federal appeals court for a year, I got to interview for clerkships with Justices Kennedy and Scalia. My meetings with them went well. I was so close to winning this last competition. I thought if I got the clerkship, I would be set for life. But I didn’t. I was heartbroken.

In 2004, after I built and sold PayPal, I ran into an old friend from law school who had helped me with my clerkship applications. We hadn’t talked in almost ten years. Instead of asking how I was, he smiled and said, “So, Peter, aren’t you glad you didn’t get that clerkship?” Looking back, we both knew that winning that big competition would have made my life worse. If I had actually worked for the Supreme Court, I probably would have spent my whole career doing boring tasks instead of creating something new. It’s hard to say how much would have changed, but the missed opportunities were huge.
