Biotech startups are a clear example of not having a definite plan. Researchers try out different ideas that might work instead of focusing on solid theories about how our bodies work. Biologists say they have to do this because understanding biology is really tough. They believe IT startups succeed because we created computers and made them follow our commands. But with biotech, it’s harder because we didn’t create our bodies, and the more we learn about them, the more complicated they seem.

Now, some people wonder if the real challenge of biology is just an excuse for biotech startups to be unclear about their business plans. Most people involved think that things will eventually work out, but not many want to fully commit to a specific company to make it successful. This starts with professors who often choose to be part-time consultants instead of full-time workers, even for biotech startups that come from their own research. Then, everyone else starts to copy the professors' unclear attitude. 

Some people argue that strict rules are holding biotech back—and they are—but having a vague sense of hope might be an even bigger problem for the future of biotech.
