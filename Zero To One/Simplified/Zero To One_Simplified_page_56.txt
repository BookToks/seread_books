Biotech startups are a clear example of thinking without limits. Researchers try out ideas that might work instead of focusing on solid theories about how our bodies function. Biologists say they have to do this because understanding biology is really tough. They believe tech startups succeed because we made computers ourselves, and they follow our commands. But biology is tricky because we didn’t create our bodies, and the more we learn, the more complicated it gets.

Today, some people wonder if the real challenge of biology has become an excuse for biotech startups to avoid making clear plans for their businesses. Most people involved think some ideas will eventually succeed, but few are willing to fully commit to a specific company, which is necessary for real success. This starts with professors who often become part-time consultants instead of working full-time, even for the biotech startups that come from their own research. Then, everyone else starts to copy the professors’ unclear attitude. Some people argue that strict rules slow down biotech progress—and they do—but having a vague sense of hope might be an even bigger problem for the future of biotech.
