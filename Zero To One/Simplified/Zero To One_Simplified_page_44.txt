In 1995, eBay didn’t need everyone in the world to use it right away. It started by being popular with groups like Beanie Baby fans. After it took over the Beanie Baby market, eBay didn’t rush to sell things like sports cars or industrial supplies. Instead, it kept focusing on small hobbyists until it became a trusted place for people to buy and sell all kinds of stuff online.

However, eBay learned that growing too fast can be tricky. Like other marketplaces, eBay became a top choice because buyers go where the sellers are and vice versa. But they found out that the auction model works best for unique items like coins and stamps. It’s not as great for everyday items like pencils or tissues because people prefer just buying those from Amazon. So, while eBay is still a strong player, it’s not as big as people thought it would be back in 2004.

Taking the right steps to grow is really important, and it takes patience. The best companies start by dominating a specific area before moving into other markets. 

In Silicon Valley, everyone is obsessed with the idea of “disruption.” This term used to mean how a new company could use technology to create a cheaper product that eventually beats out older, more expensive ones. For example, PCs disrupted mainframe computers because they started off small and then became the main choice. Now, mobile devices might be doing the same to PCs.

But lately, “disruption” has become a trendy buzzword for anything that seems new. This is a problem because it can make entrepreneurs see themselves as fighting against older companies. If you think of yourself as a rebel, you might focus too much on the challenges instead of creating something new. If your company is all about opposing existing businesses, it’s probably not going to be truly innovative or become a monopoly.

Disruption also gets attention, but it can lead to trouble. Disruptive people often end up in trouble, like kids who get sent to the principal’s office. Companies that pick fights they can’t win also face problems. For example, Napster was all about causing trouble in the music industry when it started in 1999. Its young founders, Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker, became famous but ended up in bankruptcy just a year and a half later.

PayPal is another example. While it did take some business from Visa by making online payments popular, it didn’t directly challenge them. Instead, it helped grow the overall market for payments, which benefited Visa more than it hurt them. So, when planning to grow into new markets, it’s better to avoid direct competition as much as possible.
