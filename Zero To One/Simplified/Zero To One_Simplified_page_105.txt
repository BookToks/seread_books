MAN AND MACHINE

As industries slow down, technology, especially information technology, has grown super fast. Now, when people say "technology," they often mean information tech. Today, over 1.5 billion people can instantly access tons of information using small devices like smartphones. In fact, today's smartphones are way more powerful than the computers that helped astronauts land on the moon. If things keep going this way, future computers will be even stronger.

Computers can already do things we thought only humans could do. For example, in 1997, IBM’s Deep Blue beat the world chess champion Garry Kasparov. In 2011, IBM’s Watson won against Ken Jennings, the best contestant on Jeopardy! Plus, self-driving cars from Google are already driving around in California. While race car driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. isn’t worried about them, some people are concerned that these cars might take jobs away from taxi drivers and chauffeurs.

People expect computers to do even more in the future, and some wonder if there will be any jobs left for humans in 30 years. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen believes that “software is eating the world,” meaning it’s taking over. Another VC, Andy Kessler, thinks that getting rid of people is the best way to boost productivity. Forbes even asked readers if machines might replace them.

Some futurists seem to want machines to take over, while others, called Luddites, are so scared of being replaced that they want to stop new tech from being made. Both sides agree that better computers will replace human workers, but that idea is wrong. Computers are meant to help humans, not replace them. The most successful businesses in the future will be those that focus on empowering people instead of making them unnecessary.
