MAN AND MACHINE

As industries slow down, technology has moved forward so fast that it’s now basically the same as “technology” itself. Today, over 1.5 billion people can instantly access tons of information using small devices like smartphones. Each smartphone has way more power than the computers that helped astronauts go to the moon. If things keep going like this, future computers will be even stronger.

Computers are already strong enough to beat humans in things we thought only people could do. In 1997, IBM’s Deep Blue beat the world chess champion, Garry Kasparov. In 2011, the best contestant on Jeopardy!, Ken Jennings, lost to IBM’s Watson. Plus, Google’s self-driving cars are already driving around in California. While race car driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. doesn’t need to worry about them, some people are concerned that self-driving cars could lead to a lot of job losses for drivers.

Everyone thinks computers will do even more in the future—so much that some people wonder if there will be any jobs left for humans in 30 years. Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist, has said, “Software is eating the world,” like it’s a sure thing. Another VC, Andy Kessler, seems excited when he says the best way to boost productivity is “to get rid of people.” Forbes even asked its readers: Will a machine replace you?

Some people who think about the future seem to want machines to take over. Others are so scared of being replaced that they want to stop making new technology altogether. But neither side questions the idea that better computers will replace human workers. This idea is wrong: computers are here to help humans, not take their jobs. The most successful businesses in the future will be created by people who want to empower others instead of making them unnecessary.
