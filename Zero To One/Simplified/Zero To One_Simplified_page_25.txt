We were a payments company that was worth way more than all the restaurants on Castro Street, even though we had fewer employees. Starting a new South Indian restaurant is really tough if you want to make money. If you get too caught up in small differences—like thinking your naan is better because of a family recipe—your restaurant probably won't last.

Creative jobs are similar. No screenwriter wants to admit their new movie idea is just a copy of something else. Instead, they say, “This film will mix exciting things in totally new ways.” And it might be true! For example, what if a movie starred Jay-Z as a hacker trying to catch a shark that killed his friend? That’s definitely something new. But just like there aren’t many British restaurants in Palo Alto, maybe that’s a good thing.

Companies that aren’t monopolies often try to stand out by saying they fit into a mix of smaller markets, like British food, restaurants, and Palo Alto. On the other hand, monopolies try to hide their power by saying they cover a bunch of big markets, like search engines, mobile phones, and self-driving cars.

What does this look like for a monopoly? Take a statement from Google’s chairman Eric Schmidt during a 2011 congressional hearing. He said they compete in a super tough market where customers have lots of choices.
