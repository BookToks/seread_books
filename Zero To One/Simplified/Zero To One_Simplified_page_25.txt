We were a payments company that was worth a lot more than all the restaurants on Castro Street, even though we had fewer employees. Opening a new South Indian restaurant is really tough if you want to make money. If you ignore the real competition and focus on small things—like thinking your naan is better because of your great-grandma’s recipe—your restaurant probably won’t last.

Creative jobs are similar. No screenwriter wants to admit that their new movie script is just a copy of something that’s already been made. Instead, they say, “This film will mix exciting elements in totally new ways.” That could actually be true. For example, if a writer has an idea for a movie where Jay-Z plays a hacker trying to catch a shark that killed his friend, that’s definitely something new. But just like there aren’t many British restaurants in Palo Alto, maybe that’s a good thing.

Companies that aren’t monopolies like to make themselves sound special by saying they fit into a mix of smaller markets, like British food and restaurants in Palo Alto or rap stars, hackers, and sharks. On the other hand, monopolies hide their power by saying they cover a mix of big markets, like search engines, mobile phones, wearable tech, and self-driving cars.

What does a monopolist’s story look like in real life? Think about what Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Google, said during a congressional hearing in 2011: “We have a really competitive environment where consumers have lots of choices.”
