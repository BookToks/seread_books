Another example is Sean Parker, who started out as a total outsider: a criminal. Sean was a careful hacker in high school. But his dad thought Sean was spending too much time on the computer for a 16-year-old, so one day he took away Sean’s keyboard while he was hacking. Sean couldn’t log out, the FBI noticed, and soon federal agents were arresting him.

Sean got lucky because he was a minor, and this experience made him even more determined. Three years later, he co-founded Napster. This file-sharing service quickly gained 10 million users in its first year, making it one of the fastest-growing businesses ever. But record companies sued them, and a federal judge ordered it to shut down just 20 months after it started. After that crazy time, Sean was back to being an outsider again.

Then came Facebook. Sean met Mark Zuckerberg in 2004, helped get Facebook its first funding, and became the company’s first president. He had to leave in 2005 because of drug use rumors, but this only made him more famous. Ever since Justin Timberlake played him in The Social Network, people have seen him as one of the coolest guys in America. JT is still more famous, but when he visits Silicon Valley, people ask if he’s Sean Parker.
