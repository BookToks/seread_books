Sean Parker is a guy who started off as a bit of a troublemaker. He was a smart hacker in high school, but his dad thought he was on the computer too much. One day, his dad took away his keyboard while he was hacking, and Sean couldn’t log out. The FBI noticed what was happening and arrested him.

Since he was a minor, he didn’t get in too much trouble, and this experience made him more determined. Just three years later, he helped create Napster, a service that let people share music files. It got super popular, with 10 million users in its first year, making it one of the fastest-growing companies ever. But then, record companies sued them, and a judge shut it down just 20 months after it started. After that, Sean went back to being an outsider.

Then he got involved with Facebook. He met Mark Zuckerberg in 2004, helped get Facebook its first funding, and became the company’s first president. He had to leave in 2005 because of rumors about drug use, but this only made him more famous. After Justin Timberlake played him in the movie The Social Network, many people saw Sean as one of the coolest guys in America. Even though JT is more famous, when he goes to Silicon Valley, people still ask about Sean Parker.
