Coercion. He didn’t have any solid ideas about what a good society looks like, just like Rawls. Both of them mainly talked about how things should work. Nowadays, we often make a big deal about the differences between left-liberal ideas and libertarian ideas, but most people actually agree on a lot. In philosophy, politics, and even business, arguing about how to do things has become a way to avoid making real plans for a better future.

Indefinite Life  
A long time ago, people wanted to understand how to live longer. In the 16th century, explorers looked for a magical Fountain of Youth in Florida. Francis Bacon believed that figuring out how to extend life should be its own important area of medicine. In the 1660s, Robert Boyle put life extension at the top of his wish list for future science. Whether through exploring new lands or doing lab experiments, the smartest people of the Renaissance thought they could beat death. Some people even died trying: Bacon caught pneumonia and died in 1626 while trying to see if freezing a chicken could make it live longer.

We still don’t know all the secrets of life, but in the 19th century, insurance companies and statisticians figured out something important about death: they learned how to turn it into a math problem. “Life tables” show us our chances of dying each year, which people in the past didn’t know. But while we got better insurance, it seems like we stopped searching for ways to live longer. Knowing how long people usually live has made it feel normal. Now, many people think death is both unavoidable and random.

At the same time, this way of thinking has influenced biology. In 1928, a Scottish scientist named Alexander Fleming accidentally discovered penicillin when a mold grew on a petri dish he forgot to cover. Since then, scientists have tried to use chance to find new medicines. Today, drug companies randomly mix different molecules, hoping to find something that works.

But it’s not going as well as it used to. Even though we’ve made huge progress in the last 200 years, biotechnology hasn’t lived up to what investors and patients expected in recent years. Eroom’s law—basically the opposite of Moore’s law—says that the number of new drugs approved for every billion dollars spent on research has dropped in half every nine years since 1950. While technology has sped up a lot during this time, the big question now is whether biotech will ever catch up. If you compare biotech startups to software companies, the differences are clear.
