YOU ARE NOT A LOTTERY TICKET

The big question in business is whether success comes from luck or skill. What do successful people think? Malcolm Gladwell, a well-known author, says in his book *Outliers* that success is a mix of lucky breaks and random advantages. Warren Buffett calls himself a member of the “lucky sperm club” and jokes about winning the “ovarian lottery.” Jeff Bezos says Amazon’s success is due to “incredible planetary alignment” and adds that it was “half luck, half good timing, and the rest brains.” Bill Gates even claims he was lucky to have certain skills, although it’s unclear if that’s really true.

These successful people might be trying to be humble. However, many people have started multiple successful businesses, which makes us question if success is really just about luck. Some, like Steve Jobs, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk, have created several billion-dollar companies. If success was mostly about luck, these serial entrepreneurs probably wouldn’t exist.

In January 2013, Jack Dorsey, who founded Twitter and Square, tweeted, “Success is never accidental” to his 2 million followers. Most replies were negative. A reporter named Alexis Madrigal pointed out that it’s easy for rich, successful men to say that. It’s true that successful people have an easier time starting new things because of their connections, money, or experience. But maybe we’re too quick to dismiss anyone who claims to have succeeded on purpose.

Is there a way to figure this out for sure? Not really, because businesses aren’t like science experiments. To get a clear answer about Facebook, for example, we’d need to go back to 2004, create 1,000 copies of the world, and start Facebook in each one to see how many would succeed. But that’s impossible. Every company starts under different circumstances and only once. Statistics don’t work when you only have one example.

In the past, from the Renaissance to the mid-20th century, people believed luck was something you could control. Ralph Waldo Emerson said that “shallow men believe in luck,” while “strong men believe in cause and effect.” In 1912, Roald Amundsen, the first explorer to reach the South Pole, said, “Victory awaits him who has everything in order—luck, people call it.” People knew misfortune existed, but they believed in creating their own luck through hard work.

If you think your life is mostly about chance, why read this book? Learning about startups is pointless if you’re just reading stories about people who got lucky. Books like *Slot Machines for Dummies* might tell you how to win at gambling, but they can’t teach you how to succeed in business. Did Bill Gates just get lucky with his intelligence? Was Sheryl Sandberg born into wealth, or did she work hard? When we talk about the past, luck is a big part of the conversation. But what really matters is whether the future is about chance or planning.
