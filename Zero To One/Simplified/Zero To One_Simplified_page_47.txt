YOU ARE NOT A LOTTERY TICKET

The big question in business is whether success comes from luck or skill. 

What do successful people think? Malcolm Gladwell, a well-known author, says in his book *Outliers* that success comes from a mix of lucky breaks and random advantages. Warren Buffett calls himself part of the "lucky sperm club" and thinks he won the "ovarian lottery." Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, says their success is due to "amazing timing" and jokes that it’s "half luck, half good timing, and the rest brains." Bill Gates even says he was lucky to have certain skills, but it’s not clear if that’s really a thing.

Maybe these guys are just being humble on purpose. But the idea of people starting many successful businesses makes us question if success is really just about luck. Many people have built multiple multimillion-dollar companies. A few, like Steve Jobs, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk, have created several billion-dollar companies. If success was mostly about luck, these kinds of people probably wouldn’t exist.

In January 2013, Jack Dorsey, who started Twitter and Square, tweeted to his 2 million followers: “Success is never accidental.” Most replies were negative. A reporter named Alexis Madrigal wrote that his first thought was: “ ‘Success is never accidental,’ said all multimillionaire white men.” It’s true that successful people have an easier time starting new things because of their connections, money, or experience. But maybe we’re too quick to dismiss anyone who says they succeeded on purpose.

Is there a way to figure this out for sure? Sadly, no, because businesses aren’t experiments. To get a scientific answer about Facebook, for example, we’d have to go back to 2004, create 1,000 copies of the world, and start Facebook in each one to see how many times it would succeed. But that’s impossible. Every company starts under different conditions, and each one only starts once. Statistics don’t work when you only have one example.

From the Renaissance to the mid-20th century, people believed luck was something you could control. Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “Shallow men believe in luck, believe in circumstances.… Strong men believe in cause and effect.” In 1912, Roald Amundsen, the first explorer to reach the South Pole, said: “Victory awaits him who has everything in order—luck, people call it.” People knew bad luck existed, but past generations believed in making their own luck by working hard.

If you think your life is mostly about chance, why read this book? Learning about startups is pointless if you’re just reading stories about people who got lucky. Books like *Slot Machines for Dummies* might tell you how to pick the right machine, but they won’t teach you how to win.

Did Bill Gates just get lucky with his intelligence? Was Sheryl Sandberg born into wealth, or did she work hard? When we talk about these historical questions, luck is in the past. What matters more are questions about the future: is it about chance or planning?
