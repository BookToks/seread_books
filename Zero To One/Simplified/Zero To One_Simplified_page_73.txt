In your life, you shouldn’t be looking for hidden truths. It’s already tough to be alone and believe in something that no one else does. But being alone and wrong can feel even worse.

Next is complacency. People who are at the top, like social elites, have the most freedom to think outside the box, but they often don’t believe in secrets. Why bother looking for something new when you can just enjoy what’s already been done? Every year, the leaders at top law and business schools tell new students the same thing: “You got into this great school. You don’t have to worry anymore. You’re set for life.” But that’s probably only true if you actually believe it.

The fourth point is about “flatness.” As the world becomes more connected, people see it as one big, competitive market: everything feels “flat.” With this mindset, anyone who might want to find a secret starts to think: if it was possible to discover something new, wouldn’t someone else already have done it? This doubt can stop people from even trying to find secrets in a world that seems too big for anyone to make a unique contribution.

There’s a positive way to look at these changes: today, it’s hard to start a cult. Forty years ago, people were more open to the idea that not all knowledge was known. Many believed they could join a special group that would show them the truth. Nowadays, very few people take unusual ideas seriously, and most see this as progress. It’s good that there are fewer strange cults now, but we’ve lost something important: our sense of wonder about the secrets that are still out there to discover.
