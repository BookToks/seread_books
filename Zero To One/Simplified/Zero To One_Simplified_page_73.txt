In your life, don’t go looking for secrets. It’s tough to be alone but right—putting your energy into something that no one else believes in. But being alone and wrong can feel even worse.

Next is complacency. People at the top, like social elites, have the most freedom to think outside the box, but they often believe in secrets the least. Why look for something new when you can just enjoy what’s already been done? Every fall, the leaders at top law and business schools tell new students, “You got into this great school. You’re all set for life.” But that’s probably only true if you don’t actually believe it.

Then there’s “flatness.” As the world becomes more connected, people see it as one big, competitive market: everything is “flat.” With that mindset, anyone who wants to find a secret might think, if it were possible to discover something new, wouldn’t someone smarter or more creative have already found it? This doubt can stop people from even trying to find secrets in a world that feels too big for anyone to make a unique contribution.

There’s a positive way to look at these trends: nowadays, it’s hard to start a cult. Forty years ago, people were more open to the idea that not all knowledge was known. From the Communist Party to the Hare Krishnas, many believed they could join a special group that would show them the truth. Today, very few take unusual ideas seriously, and many see this as progress. While it’s good that there are fewer strange cults now, we’ve lost our sense of wonder about the secrets still waiting to be discovered.
