The first team I built is known in Silicon Valley as the "PayPal Mafia" because many of my old coworkers have helped each other start and invest in successful tech companies. We sold PayPal to eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002. Since then, Elon Musk has started SpaceX and co-founded Tesla Motors. Reid Hoffman co-founded LinkedIn. Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim created YouTube together. Jeremy Stoppelman and Russel Simmons founded Yelp. David Sacks co-founded Yammer, and I co-founded Palantir. Today, all seven of these companies are worth over $1 billion each. PayPal’s office perks didn’t get much attention, but the team has done really well, both together and individually. The strong culture we built helped us succeed beyond just the original company.

We didn’t create a mafia by just picking the most talented people from resumes. I saw how that approach didn’t always work when I was at a law firm in New York. The lawyers there ran a successful business and were impressive individually, but their relationships were pretty weak. They spent all day together, but didn’t seem to talk much outside of work. Why work with people who don’t even like each other? Some think it’s a necessary sacrifice to make money, but only seeing work as a business deal is not just cold; it doesn’t make sense. Since time is super valuable, it’s strange to spend it with people who don’t plan for a future together. If you can’t build lasting friendships at work, you’re not using your time wisely—even if you’re making money.

From the beginning, I wanted PayPal to be a close-knit team instead of just a business deal. I believed that stronger relationships would make us happier and better at our jobs, and also help us succeed in our careers beyond PayPal. So, we aimed to hire people who would actually enjoy working together. They needed to be talented, but more importantly, they had to be excited about working with us. That’s how the PayPal Mafia started.
