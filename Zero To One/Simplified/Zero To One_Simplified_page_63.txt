Venture capitalists are people who look for new companies that could make a lot of money. They collect money from rich people and organizations, put it together in a fund, and invest in tech companies they think will grow in value. If they pick the right companies, they earn a share of the profits, usually around 20%. A venture fund makes money when the companies it invested in either go public or get bought by bigger companies. These funds usually last about 10 years because it takes time for companies to grow and succeed.

However, most of the companies that get venture funding don’t end up doing well; many fail soon after they start. Because of these early failures, a venture fund often loses money at first. Venture capitalists hope that over a few years, the value of their fund will go up a lot when the few successful companies start to grow quickly.

The big question is when this growth will happen. For many funds, it might never happen. Most startups fail, and many funds fail along with them. Every venture capitalist knows they need to find the companies that will succeed, but even experienced investors don’t fully understand how different companies can be. They often think that returns from investments will follow a normal pattern: bad companies fail, average ones stay the same, and good ones double or quadruple their value. Based on this idea, investors create a mix of different investments, hoping that the successful ones will make up for the failures.

But this “spray and pray” method usually results in a lot of failed investments with no big successes. This happens because the returns from venture capital don’t follow a normal pattern. Instead, they follow a power law: a few companies do really well while most don’t. If you focus too much on spreading out your investments instead of finding those rare companies that can be extremely valuable, you might miss out on them altogether.
