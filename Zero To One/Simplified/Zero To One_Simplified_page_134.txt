The most famous people in the world are also creators: instead of starting a company, every celebrity builds and grows their own personal brand. 

Take Lady Gaga, for example. She’s one of the most powerful people alive today. But is she really just a regular person? Her real name isn’t a secret, but hardly anyone knows or cares what it is. She wears such crazy outfits that anyone else would probably get sent to a mental hospital for it. Gaga wants us to think she was “born this way”—which is the name of her second album and its biggest song. But nobody is actually born looking like a zombie with horns on their head, so Gaga must have created this wild image herself. 

But then again, what kind of person would do that to themselves? Definitely not someone normal. So maybe Gaga really was born that way after all.
