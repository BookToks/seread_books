The most famous people in the world create their own brands, just like companies do. Every celebrity builds a personal image that people recognize. 

Take Lady Gaga, for example. She’s one of the most influential people today. But is she really just a regular person? Her real name isn’t a secret, but hardly anyone knows or cares what it is. She wears such crazy outfits that anyone else would probably get sent to a mental hospital for them. Gaga wants us to think she was “born this way,” which is also the name of her second album and its main song. But no one is born looking like a zombie with horns on their head. So, she must have created this wild image for herself. 

But then again, what kind of person would do that to themselves? Definitely not someone normal. So maybe Gaga really was born this way after all.
