You’ve probably heard about “first mover advantage”: if you’re the first to enter a market, you can grab a lot of customers while others are still trying to catch up. But being first isn’t the main goal. What really matters is making money in the future, so being the first doesn’t help if someone else comes along and takes your place. 

It’s way better to be the last mover. This means making the best final development in a market and enjoying profits for years or even decades. The best way to do this is to focus on a small area and then grow from there towards your big dreams. In this way, business is a lot like chess. 

Grandmaster José Raúl Capablanca said it best: to win, “you must study the endgame before everything else.”
