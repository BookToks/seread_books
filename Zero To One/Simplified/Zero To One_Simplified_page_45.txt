THE LAST WILL BE FIRST

You’ve probably heard about “first mover advantage”: if you’re the first to enter a market, you can grab a big share while others are trying to catch up. But being first is just a strategy, not the main goal. What really matters is making money in the future, so being the first doesn’t help if someone else comes along and takes your place.

It’s actually better to be the last mover. This means making the final big improvement in a market and enjoying years or even decades of profits. The best way to do this is to focus on a small area and then grow from there towards your big goals. In this way, business is a lot like chess.

Grandmaster José Raúl Capablanca said it well: to be successful, “you must study the endgame before everything else.”
