FOLLOW THE MONEY

MONEY MAKES MONEY. “For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them” (Matthew 25:29). Albert Einstein once said that compound interest is “the eighth wonder of the world” and “the greatest mathematical discovery of all time.” He believed it was one of the most powerful forces in the universe. No matter how you look at it, his point is clear: don’t underestimate how quickly money can grow.

Actually, there’s no proof that Einstein ever said those things—those quotes are made up. But this mistake shows his point: even after he’s gone, people still remember him for ideas he didn’t even say. Most quotes get forgotten, but a few people like Einstein and Shakespeare are quoted all the time. This happens because a small number of people often achieve much more than everyone else.

In 1906, an economist named Vilfredo Pareto noticed something interesting: 20% of people owned 80% of the land in Italy. This idea became known as the “Pareto principle” or the 80-20 rule. He found this pattern in his garden too, where 20% of the pea plants produced 80% of the peas. This kind of pattern, where a few people or things are way more successful than the rest, is everywhere in nature and society. The strongest earthquakes are much more powerful than all the smaller ones combined. The biggest cities are way larger than all the small towns put together. And big companies make more money than millions of smaller ones. Whether or not Einstein said those quotes, the power law—where a few things dominate—rules our world. It’s so common that we often don’t even notice it.

This chapter explains how you can see the power law when you look at money: in venture capital, where investors want to make money from fast-growing new companies, a few companies become much more valuable than all the others. Most businesses don’t deal with venture capital, but everyone should understand one key thing that even venture capitalists find tricky: we don’t live in a normal world; we live under a power law.
