Which of the four options will happen? 

A total collapse of civilization seems unlikely because we have so much knowledge today. It’s more likely that if we face extinction, there won’t be any future for humans at all. 

If we think of the future as a time that’s different from now, most people don’t expect much change. They believe that in the coming years, the world will become more connected and similar. In this idea, poorer countries will catch up to richer ones, and the economy will level out. But even if this global balance could happen, how long could it last? 

In the best case, competition for resources would be tougher than ever for everyone. But when there’s competition for limited resources, it’s hard to see how this balance could last forever. Without new technology to help, this stagnation could lead to conflicts. If conflicts happen worldwide, stagnation could lead to extinction. 

That brings us to the fourth option, where we create new technology for a better future. The most exciting version of this is called the Singularity, which is about new technologies that are so advanced they go beyond what we currently understand. Ray Kurzweil, a well-known thinker about the Singularity, believes that because of rapid growth in technology, we will eventually have super-smart artificial intelligence. He says, “the Singularity is near,” and we just need to get ready for it. 

But even with all these trends, the future won’t just happen on its own. What the Singularity might look like is less important than the choice we face now: nothing or something. It’s up to us to make sure the future is better, and that means we need to start working on it today. 

Whether we reach the Singularity on a large scale is less important than taking advantage of the chances we have to create new things in our lives. Everything that matters to us—like the universe, the planet, our country, our jobs, and our lives—is unique. 

Our job today is to find special ways to create new things that will make the future not just different, but better. The first step is to think for yourself. Only by seeing things differently can we truly create change.
