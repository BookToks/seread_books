A lot of people have been feeling negative about the future. Even today, many parts of the world are still stuck in this negative mindset. An indefinite pessimist looks at the future and sees nothing but bad things, but they don’t know how to fix it. This has been the case in Europe since the 1970s when things started to go downhill without any clear direction. Right now, the Eurozone is facing a slow crisis, and no one seems to be in charge. The European Central Bank doesn’t really have a solid plan; it’s like they just keep pushing problems away instead of solving them. People in Europe just react to what happens and hope for the best. The indefinite pessimist doesn’t know if things will get worse quickly or slowly. All they can do is wait, so they might as well enjoy life, which is why Europeans love to take vacations.

On the other hand, a definite pessimist thinks they can predict the future, and since it looks bad, they need to get ready for it. Surprisingly, China is probably the most definitely pessimistic place today. When Americans see China’s economy growing super fast, they think China is confident about its future. But that’s because Americans are generally more optimistic and project that onto China. From China’s perspective, they feel like they need to grow even faster. While other countries worry about China taking over, China is worried that it might not be able to keep up. 

China’s rapid growth is possible because it started from a low point. They are mainly copying what has worked in the West to grow quickly. They are making plans to build more factories and skyscrapers, but with so many people, it’s hard for living standards to catch up to the richest countries, and they know it. The Chinese leaders are very aware of the risks because many of them experienced famine as kids. When they think about the future, they see real dangers. The Chinese public also knows that tough times could be ahead. While outsiders are amazed by the wealth in China, they often overlook the wealthy Chinese trying to move their money out. Poorer people in China save as much as they can, hoping it will be enough. Everyone in China takes the future very seriously.

A definite optimist believes that the future can be better than today if they plan and work hard. From the 17th century to the 1950s and ’60s, definite optimists were the driving force in the Western world. Scientists, engineers, doctors, and businesspeople made life better, healthier, and longer than ever before. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels pointed out that the business class in the 19th century created more powerful tools and technologies than all the generations before them combined. They harnessed nature, developed machines, used chemistry in industries and farming, built railways, and created entire cities.
