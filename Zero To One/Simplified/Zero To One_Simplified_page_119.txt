THE PEOPLE QUESTION

Energy problems are really about engineering, so you might think that smart tech people would be in charge of cleantech companies. But that’s not true: the companies that failed were led by teams that didn’t know much about technology. These businesspeople were great at getting money and government support, but they struggled to create products that people actually wanted to buy.

At Founders Fund, we noticed this trend early on. One big clue was what the cleantech leaders wore: they were often in suits and ties. This was a big warning sign because real tech people usually wear T-shirts and jeans. So, we made a rule: we wouldn’t invest in any company whose founders dressed up for meetings. 

Maybe we could have avoided bad investments by looking closely at each company’s technology. But our insight—never invest in a tech CEO who wears a suit—helped us figure things out much faster. The best sales are often not obvious. There’s nothing wrong with a CEO who can sell, but if they look like a typical salesman, they probably aren’t great at selling or technology. 

Think of Solyndra’s CEO Brian Harrison and Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk.
