THE PEOPLE QUESTION

Energy problems are really about engineering, so you might think that smart tech people would be in charge of cleantech companies. But you'd be wrong: the companies that didn't do well were led by teams that didn’t know much about tech. These business guys were good at getting money and government help, but they struggled to make products that people actually wanted to buy.

At Founders Fund, we noticed this trend. One big clue was what the cleantech leaders wore: suits and ties. This was a big warning sign because real tech people usually wear T-shirts and jeans. So, we made a rule: we wouldn’t invest in any company whose founders dressed up for meetings. We might have still avoided bad investments if we had looked closely at each company’s tech. But our insight—never invest in a tech CEO who wears a suit—helped us find the truth much faster. The best sales are often not obvious. It’s fine if a CEO can sell, but if they look like a typical salesman, they probably aren’t good at sales or tech.
