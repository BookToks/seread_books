In March 2001, PayPal wasn't making any money yet, but our sales were doubling every year. When I looked at how much money we would make in the future, I realized that 75% of the company's value would come from profits starting in 2011 and later. This was surprising for a company that had only been around for 27 months. But it turned out I was underestimating things. Now, PayPal is still growing at about 15% each year, and the interest rates are lower than they were ten years ago. Most of the company's value is now expected to come from 2020 and later.

LinkedIn is another example of a company that is valued for its future. In early 2014, LinkedIn was worth $24.5 billion, which is a lot for a company that made less than $1 billion in sales and only $21.6 million in profit in 2012. You might think investors are crazy looking at those numbers. But this value makes sense when you think about how much money LinkedIn is expected to make in the future.
