Future profits are super important, even in places like Silicon Valley. For a company to be valuable, it needs to grow and last a long time. But a lot of entrepreneurs only think about quick growth. They have a reason for this: it's easy to measure growth, but it's hard to measure how long a company will last. 

Some people get really caught up in numbers like how many users they have each week, how much money they make each month, and how much they earn every three months. But you can hit those numbers and still miss bigger problems that could hurt your business in the long run. 

For example, both Zynga and Groupon grew really fast, but that made them ignore long-term issues. Zynga had early hits with games like Farmville and claimed to have a special system to figure out what games people would like. But they faced the same problem as Hollywood: how do you keep making popular stuff for people who change their minds all the time? (No one really knows.) Groupon grew quickly because lots of local businesses tried their service. But getting those businesses to keep coming back was tougher than they expected. 

If you only care about short-term growth, you miss the most important question: will this business still be around in ten years? Just looking at numbers won't give you the answer; you need to think carefully about what makes your business strong.
