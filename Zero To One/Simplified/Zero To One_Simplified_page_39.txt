Future profits are super important, even in places like Silicon Valley. For a company to be valuable, it needs to grow and last a long time. But a lot of entrepreneurs only care about quick growth. They have a reason for this: it's easy to measure growth, but it's hard to measure how long a business will last. Some people get so caught up in tracking numbers like weekly users, monthly revenue, and quarterly earnings that they forget to look at deeper problems that could hurt their business in the long run.

For example, both Zynga and Groupon grew quickly, but that made them ignore bigger challenges. Zynga had early success with games like Farmville and claimed to have a special system to measure how much people liked new games. But they faced the same issue as Hollywood: how do you keep making popular stuff for an audience that changes its mind all the time? (No one really knows.) Groupon also grew fast because many local businesses tried their service, but getting those businesses to keep coming back was tougher than they expected.

If you only focus on short-term growth, you might miss the most important question: will this business still be around in ten years? Just looking at numbers won't give you the answer; you need to think carefully about what makes your business strong.
