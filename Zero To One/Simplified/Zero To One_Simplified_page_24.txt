What if we think of Google as a tech company with many sides? That makes sense because, besides its search engine, Google creates a lot of other software, robotic cars, Android phones, and wearable tech. But here's the catch: 95% of Google's money comes from ads in its search engine. Other products only made $2.35 billion in 2012, and its consumer tech made even less. Since the global consumer tech market is worth $964 billion, Google only has a tiny piece of it—less than 0.24%. This shows it’s not as big as it seems. By calling itself just another tech company, Google can avoid some unwanted attention.

Now, let’s talk about how some companies lie about their competition. They say, “We’re in a league of our own.” Entrepreneurs often downplay how much competition they really have, which is a big mistake. It’s tempting to make your market sound super small so you seem like the best. For example, if you want to open a British restaurant in Palo Alto, you might think, “No one else is doing this. We’ll own the market!” But that’s only true if you only think about British food. What if the real market is all the restaurants in Palo Alto? And what about restaurants in nearby towns? These are tough questions, but the bigger issue is that you might not want to ask them. When you hear that most new restaurants fail in a year or two, you might just want to convince everyone that yours is special instead of checking if that’s really true. It’s better to think about whether people in Palo Alto actually want to eat British food at all. They might not.

Back in 2001, my coworkers at PayPal and I would often grab lunch on Castro Street in Mountain View. We had tons of restaurant choices, like Indian, sushi, and burgers. There were even more options when we picked a specific type, like North Indian or South Indian, cheap or fancy. Compared to the busy local restaurant scene, PayPal was the only email-based payment system at that time.
