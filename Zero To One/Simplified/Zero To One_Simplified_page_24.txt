What if we think of Google as a tech company with many sides instead? That makes sense because, besides its search engine, Google creates lots of other software, robotic cars, Android phones, and wearable tech. But here’s the catch: 95% of Google's money comes from ads on its search engine. In 2012, its other products only made $2.35 billion, and its consumer tech made even less. Since the whole consumer tech market is worth $964 billion worldwide, Google has less than 0.24% of it, which isn’t much at all. By calling itself just another tech company, Google can avoid a lot of unwanted attention.

On the other hand, companies that aren’t monopolies often lie by saying, “We’re in a league of our own.” Entrepreneurs usually downplay how much competition there really is, but that’s a big mistake for a startup. The tempting mistake is to define your market super narrowly so it looks like you’re the best by default. For example, if you want to open a British restaurant in Palo Alto, you might think, “No one else is doing this, so we’ll own the whole market.” But that’s only true if you only think about British food. What if the real market is all the restaurants in Palo Alto? And what if nearby towns have restaurants that count too?

These are tough questions, but the bigger issue is that you might not want to ask them. When you hear that most new restaurants fail within one or two years, your first thought might be to convince everyone that yours is different. You’ll spend time trying to show how special you are instead of really thinking about whether that’s true. It would be smarter to take a moment and consider if there are actually people in Palo Alto who really want British food. It’s very possible they don’t exist.

Back in 2001, my coworkers at PayPal and I often went to lunch on Castro Street in Mountain View. We had tons of restaurant choices, like Indian, sushi, and burgers. There were even more options once we picked a type, like North Indian or South Indian, cheap or fancy, and so on. Compared to the busy local restaurant scene, PayPal was the only email-
