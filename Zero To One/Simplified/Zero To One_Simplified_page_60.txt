YOU ARE NOT A LOTTERY TICKET

We need to find a clear path to a better future, and the Western world really needs a big change in culture to make that happen.

So, where do we begin? We need to move away from old ideas in philosophy classes. People like John Rawls need to be replaced. We also need to convince Malcolm Gladwell to rethink his theories. Plus, we should get pollsters out of politics.

But changing these things is tough. Philosophy teachers and popular thinkers like Gladwell are stuck in their ways, and so are our politicians. Itâ€™s really hard to make changes in those crowded areas, even if we have smart ideas and good intentions.

Starting a business is one of the few things you can really control. You can shape not just your own life but also a small, important part of the world around you. It all starts with saying no to the unfairness of luck. Remember, you are not a lottery ticket.
