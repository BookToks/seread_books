YOU ARE NOT A LOTTERY TICKET

We need to find a clear path to a better future, and the Western world really needs a big change in its culture to make that happen.

Where do we begin? 

We need to move away from old ideas in philosophy classes. People like John Rawls need to be replaced. We also need to convince Malcolm Gladwell to rethink his theories. Plus, we have to push pollsters out of politics.

But changing the minds of philosophy teachers and popular thinkers like Gladwell is tough. Our politicians are also hard to change. Itâ€™s really difficult to make progress in these crowded areas, even if you have good ideas and smart plans.

Starting a new business is one of the few things you can truly control. You can have a say not just in your own life, but also in a small, important part of the world. It starts by saying no to the unfair randomness of luck. You are not a lottery ticket.
