What better reward for spending twenty years building a résumé than a fancy job that claims to keep your options open? 

Parents of recent graduates often support the traditional career path. The Baby Boomers grew up in a time when things just kept getting better, so they expect the same for their kids. If you were born between 1945 and 1955, your first 18 years were filled with progress that you didn’t even have to work for. 

Technology was advancing so quickly that Boomers had high hopes but didn’t really plan how to achieve them. Then, in the 1970s, when tech growth slowed down, the richest Boomers still did well because of growing income inequality. While the wealthy kept getting richer, many others in their generation struggled. But the successful Boomers today still believe their luck will work for their kids too.

Malcolm Gladwell says you can’t really get why Bill Gates succeeded without knowing his lucky background: he had a good family, went to a private school with a computer lab, and had a friend like Paul Allen. But maybe you can’t fully understand Gladwell either without knowing he’s a Boomer born in 1963. When Boomers write about why someone is successful, they often focus on luck. But they overlook a bigger picture: their generation learned to overvalue luck and undervalue planning. Gladwell seems to challenge the idea of the self-made success story, but his views actually reflect what many in his generation believe.
