What’s a better reward after two decades of building a résumé than a fancy job that claims to “keep options open”? 

Parents of recent grads often cheer for the traditional path. The Baby Boomers grew up with a lot of hope and were used to things getting better without much effort. If you were born between 1945 and 1955, life improved every year for the first 18 years, and it wasn’t because of anything you did. Technology seemed to get better on its own, so Boomers had high hopes but didn’t really plan how to achieve them. Then, in the 1970s, when tech progress slowed down, the wealth gap started to grow. The rich Boomers kept getting richer, while the rest of their generation struggled. But the wealthy Boomers, who influence public opinion today, don’t see any reason to doubt their positive outlook. Since their careers worked out, they think the same will happen for their kids.

Malcolm Gladwell says you can’t really get why Bill Gates succeeded without knowing about his lucky background: he had a good family, went to a private school with a computer lab, and had Paul Allen as a childhood friend. But maybe you can’t fully understand Malcolm Gladwell without knowing his background as a Boomer (he was born in 1963). When Baby Boomers write books about why certain people succeed, they often focus on luck. But they overlook the bigger picture: their generation learned to overvalue luck and undervalue planning. Gladwell seems to challenge the idea of the self-made entrepreneur, but his views actually reflect the common beliefs of his generation.
