DO ONE THING

Every person should stand out because of their work. 

When you give jobs to people in a startup, think of it like a puzzle where you need to fit the right pieces together. Even if you find the perfect fit, things can change quickly. Startups need to move fast, so job roles can’t stay the same for long. Plus, job assignments aren’t just about what tasks people do; they also depend on how employees get along with each other.

The best decision I made as a manager at PayPal was to have each person focus on just one thing. Each person's task was different, and everyone knew I would judge them based only on that one thing. I started this to make managing easier, but I noticed something important: it cut down on fights. Most arguments at work happen when people want the same job or responsibilities. Startups are especially prone to this because roles can change a lot in the beginning. By reducing competition, it helps everyone form strong relationships that go beyond just being coworkers. 

Also, keeping the peace inside a startup is crucial for its survival. When a startup fails, we often think it’s because of tough competition from other companies. But every company has its own issues, and fighting among employees can make it weak against outside threats. Internal conflict is like a disease: while the visible problem might be a failure, the real issue is often hidden beneath the surface.
