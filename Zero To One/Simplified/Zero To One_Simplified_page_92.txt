DO ONE THING

Every person in a company should be known for their specific work. 

When giving jobs to people in a startup, you can think of it like a puzzle where you match skills with tasks. But even if you get it right at first, things will change quickly. Startups need to move fast, so job roles can’t stay the same for long. Plus, it’s not just about what tasks people do; it’s also about how they get along with each other.

The best thing I did as a manager at PayPal was to make sure each person was responsible for just one thing. Each person's task was different, and everyone knew I would judge their performance based only on that one thing. I started this to make managing easier, but I found out it also helped reduce arguments. Most conflicts in a company happen when coworkers fight over the same jobs. Startups are especially prone to this because roles can change a lot in the beginning. By removing competition, it’s easier for everyone to build strong relationships that go beyond just work. Plus, having a peaceful environment is crucial for a startup to succeed. When a startup fails, we often think it’s because of tough competitors. But every company has its own issues, and fighting among employees makes it weak against outside challenges. Internal conflict is like an illness; the visible problem might be something obvious, but the real issue is often hidden.
