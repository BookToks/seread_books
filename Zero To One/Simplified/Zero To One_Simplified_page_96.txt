NERDS VS. SALESMEN

In the U.S., the advertising industry makes about $150 billion a year and has over 600,000 workers. The sales industry is even bigger, making $450 billion a year. When people hear that 3.2 million Americans work in sales, experienced business people might think that number is low, while engineers might be confused. What could that many salespeople possibly be doing?

In Silicon Valley, nerds often doubt advertising, marketing, and sales because they seem shallow and not very smart. But advertising is important because it actually works. It works on nerds and it works on you. You might think you’re different and that advertising doesn’t affect you, but it does. It’s easy to ignore obvious sales pitches, which makes us feel like we’re independent thinkers. But advertising isn’t just about making you buy something right away; it’s about planting ideas in your mind that will make you want to buy later. If you can’t see how it affects you, you’re being fooled even more.

Nerds like things to be clear. They add value by being really good at a skill like computer programming. In engineering, a solution either works or it doesn’t. It’s easy to judge someone else's work because looks don’t matter much. Sales is different: it’s all about changing how things look without changing what’s really there. Engineers think this is silly or even dishonest. They know their jobs are tough, so when they see salespeople chatting on the phone or having long lunches, they think no real work is happening. People often think science and engineering are harder than they really are because the challenges are obvious. What nerds don’t realize is that making sales look easy takes a lot of hard work.
