NERDS VS. SALESMEN

In the U.S., the advertising industry makes about $150 billion every year and has over 600,000 workers. The sales industry is even bigger, bringing in $450 billion a year. When people hear that 3.2 million Americans work in sales, some experienced business people might think that number is low, while engineers might be confused. What could that many salespeople be doing?

In Silicon Valley, nerds often doubt advertising, marketing, and sales because they seem fake and not very smart. But advertising is important because it actually works. It works on nerds and it works on you too. You might think you’re different and that advertising doesn’t affect you, but it does. It’s easy to ignore obvious ads, which makes us feel like we think for ourselves. But ads are not just about making you buy something right away; they are meant to create lasting impressions that will make you buy later. If you don’t realize how ads affect you, you’re fooling yourself even more.

Nerds like things to be clear and straightforward. They add value by being really good at technical skills like computer programming. In engineering, a solution either works or it doesn’t. You can easily check someone else’s work because looks don’t matter much. Sales is different: it’s all about changing how things seem without changing what’s really there. Engineers think this is silly or even dishonest. They know their jobs are tough, so when they see salespeople chatting on the phone or having long lunches, they think no real work is happening. People often think science and engineering are harder than they really are, because the challenges are obvious. What nerds don’t see is that it takes a lot of effort to make sales look easy.
