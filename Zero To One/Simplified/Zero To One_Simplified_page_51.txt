In the 1950s, Americans believed that big plans for the future were too important to just leave to experts.

Indefinite Optimism

After a short time of feeling negative in the 1970s, Americans have mostly felt positively about the future since 1982. This was when a long period of economic growth started, and finance became more important than engineering for planning the future. 

For someone who is an indefinite optimist, they believe the future will be better, but they don’t know how it will happen, so they don’t make specific plans. They expect to benefit from the future but don’t see a need to create a clear plan for it.

Instead of spending years creating new products, indefinite optimists focus on changing and improving things that already exist. Bankers make money by changing how existing companies are funded. Lawyers help settle arguments about old issues or assist others in organizing their businesses. Private equity investors and management consultants don’t start new companies; they just find ways to make old ones work better by constantly improving processes. It’s no surprise that many smart people from top universities are drawn to these jobs; they see a lot of potential there.
