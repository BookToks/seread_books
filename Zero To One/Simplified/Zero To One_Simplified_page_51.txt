In the 1950s, Americans believed that making big plans for the future was too important to leave to just the experts.

Indefinite Optimism  
After a short time of feeling negative in the 1970s, Americans have mostly felt positively about the future since 1982. This was when a long period of economic growth started, and finance became more important than engineering for planning ahead. An indefinite optimist thinks the future will be better, but they don’t know how it will happen, so they don’t make specific plans. They believe they will benefit from the future but don’t see a need to shape it in a clear way.

Instead of spending years creating something new, indefinite optimists focus on changing things that already exist. Bankers make money by changing how money is used in companies that are already there. Lawyers help settle arguments about old things or assist others in organizing their business. Private equity investors and management consultants don’t start new companies; they just find ways to make old ones work better. It makes sense that these jobs attract a lot of smart people from top universities who want to chase new opportunities.
