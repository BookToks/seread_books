FOUNDATIONS

Every great company is different, but there are some things every business needs to get right from the start. I talk about this so much that my friends jokingly call it “Thiel’s law”: a startup that messes up its foundation can’t be fixed.

Beginnings are important. They are really different from everything that comes later. This was true 13.8 billion years ago when our universe started. In the first tiny moments of its existence, the universe grew by a huge amount—like a million trillion trillion times bigger. During those first moments, the laws of physics were not the same as we know them now.

It was also true 227 years ago when our country was founded. Important questions were discussed by the people at the Constitutional Convention. They talked about how much power the central government should have and how to decide representation in Congress. No matter what you think about the compromises they made that summer in Philadelphia, it’s been hard to change them since. After adding the Bill of Rights in 1791, we’ve only changed the Constitution 17 times. Today, California has the same number of senators as Alaska, even though it has over 50 times more people. Maybe that’s just how it is. But we’re probably stuck with it as long as the United States exists. Another convention to change the Constitution is unlikely; now we only debate smaller issues.

Companies are like countries in this way. Bad choices made early on—like picking the wrong partners or hiring the wrong people—are really hard to fix later. It might take a big problem, like going bankrupt, before anyone tries to fix them. As a founder, your main job is to get the first things right because you can’t build a great company on a bad foundation.
