FOUNDATIONS

Every great company is different, but there are some important things every business needs to get right from the start. I say this so often that my friends jokingly call it “Thiel’s law”: a startup that starts off wrong can’t be fixed later.

Beginnings are important. They are really different from everything that comes after. This was true 13.8 billion years ago when our universe began. In the first tiny moments of its life, the universe grew by a huge amount—like a million trillion trillion times bigger. In those early moments, the rules of physics were not the same as we know them today.

It was also true 227 years ago when our country was founded. Big questions were up for discussion by the people who created the Constitution during the few months they spent together. How much power should the central government have? How should Congress represent the people? No matter what you think about the compromises they made that summer in Philadelphia, it’s been hard to change them since then. After adding the Bill of Rights in 1791, we’ve only changed the Constitution 17 times. Today, California has the same number of senators as Alaska, even though it has more than 50 times the population. Maybe that’s just how it is. But we’re probably stuck with it as long as the United States exists. Another meeting to change the Constitution is unlikely; now we only talk about smaller issues.

Companies are like countries in this way. Bad choices made early on—like picking the wrong partners or hiring the wrong people—are really hard to fix later. It might take a big crisis, like going bankrupt, before anyone tries to make changes. As a founder, your first job is to get the basics right because you can’t build a great company on a weak foundation.
