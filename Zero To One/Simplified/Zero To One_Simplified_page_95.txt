IF YOU BUILD IT, WILL THEY COME?

Even though sales are everywhere, most people don’t realize how important they are. In Silicon Valley, people often ignore this even more. In the book The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, the story talks about how the planet was created partly because of a dislike for salespeople. When a disaster happens and everyone needs to leave Earth, they escape on three huge ships. The smart people and leaders go on the A Ship, the salespeople and consultants go on the B Ship, and the workers go on the C Ship. The B Ship leaves first, and everyone on it is happy. But they don’t know they are part of a trick: the A Ship and C Ship people always thought the B Ship people were useless, so they planned to get rid of them. In the end, it’s the B Ship that lands on Earth.

In real life, how you get your product to people is really important. We often underestimate how crucial this is because we think salespeople and other “middlemen” just get in the way. We believe that if you create a good product, it should sell itself. This idea is especially common in Silicon Valley, where engineers focus more on making cool things instead of selling them. But just building something doesn’t mean customers will come. You have to work to make that happen, and it’s tougher than it seems.
