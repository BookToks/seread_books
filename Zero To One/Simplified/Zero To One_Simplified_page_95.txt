IF YOU BUILD IT, WILL THEY COME?

Even though sales are everywhere, many people don’t realize how important they are. In Silicon Valley, this is even more true. The famous book The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy describes how our planet was created as a way to escape salespeople. When a disaster happens, humans leave their home on three huge ships. The smart people and leaders take the A Ship, the salespeople and consultants get the B Ship, and the workers take the C Ship. The B Ship leaves first, and everyone on it is happy. But the salespeople don’t know they’re being tricked: the A Ship and C Ship people always thought the B Ship people were useless, so they planned to get rid of them. In the end, it’s the B Ship that lands on Earth.

In stories, distribution might not matter, but in real life, it’s super important. We often underestimate how crucial distribution is, which means everything needed to sell a product. This happens because we think like the A Ship and C Ship people: that salespeople and “middlemen” just get in the way, and that good products will sell themselves. This idea is really popular in Silicon Valley, where engineers focus on making cool things instead of selling them. But just building something doesn’t mean customers will come. You have to work to make that happen, and it’s tougher than it seems.
