But that doesn’t show the weirdest thing about founders. Usually, we think that opposite traits can’t exist together. For example, a normal person can’t be both rich and poor at the same time. But this happens a lot with founders: startup CEOs might not have cash but are millionaires on paper. They can switch between being grumpy and being really charming. 

Most successful entrepreneurs are both part of the group and separate from it. When they succeed, they get both fame and bad reputation. If you look at their traits, they seem to follow a strange pattern.
