About the Authors

Peter Thiel is a businessman and investor. He started PayPal in 1998, was its CEO, and took it public in 2002. This changed how people shop online by making it faster and safer. In 2004, he made the first investment in Facebook and is still a director there. That same year, he created Palantir Technologies, a software company that helps people analyze data in areas like security and finance. He has also invested early in companies like LinkedIn and Yelp, and many of these businesses are run by his former coworkers, known as the “PayPal Mafia.” He is a partner at Founders Fund, a company that invests in startups like SpaceX and Airbnb. He started the Thiel Fellowship, which sparked a big discussion about putting learning before traditional schooling. He also leads the Thiel Foundation, which aims to promote technology and think about the future.
