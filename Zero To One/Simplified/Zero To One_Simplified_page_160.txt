About the Authors

Peter Thiel is a business guy and investor. He started PayPal in 1998, was the CEO, and took it public in 2002, changing how we shop online. In 2004, he was the first outside investor in Facebook, where he still helps out as a director. That same year, he created Palantir Technologies, a software company that helps people analyze data for things like national security and finance. He also helped fund LinkedIn, Yelp, and many other successful tech startups, often run by his former coworkers known as the “PayPal Mafia.” He is a partner at Founders Fund, a venture capital firm in Silicon Valley that has invested in companies like SpaceX and Airbnb. He started the Thiel Fellowship, which sparked a big discussion about encouraging young people to focus on learning instead of just going to school. He also runs the Thiel Foundation, which aims to promote tech progress and think about the future.

Blake Masters was a student at Stanford Law School in 2012 when his detailed notes from Peter’s class “Computer Science 183: Startup” became super popular online. He later co-founded Judicata, a legal research tech startup.
