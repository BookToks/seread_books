About the Authors

Peter Thiel is a businessman and investor. He started PayPal in 1998, was its CEO, and took it public in 2002, changing how we shop online. In 2004, he made the first big investment in Facebook and is still on its board. That same year, he created Palantir Technologies, a software company that helps people analyze data for things like national security and finance. He also helped fund LinkedIn, Yelp, and many other successful tech startups, many run by people he worked with at PayPal, known as the “PayPal Mafia.” He is a partner at Founders Fund, a company that invests in startups like SpaceX and Airbnb. He started the Thiel Fellowship, which sparked a big conversation about encouraging young people to focus on learning instead of just going to school. He also leads the Thiel Foundation, which aims to promote technology and think about the future.

Blake Masters was a student at Stanford Law School in 2012 when his detailed notes from Peter’s class “Computer Science 183: Startup” became super popular online. He later co-founded Judicata, a startup that focuses on legal research technology.
