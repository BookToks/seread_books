The problems with copying others can help explain why people who struggle with social skills, like those with Asperger’s, might do well in Silicon Valley today. If you don’t pick up on social hints easily, you’re less likely to follow what everyone else is doing. If you love creating things or coding, you won’t be scared to focus on those interests and get really good at them. When you use your skills, you’re also less likely to change your beliefs, which can keep you from getting lost in the competition for obvious rewards.

Competition can make people see chances that aren’t really there. A wild example from the ’90s was the fight for the online pet store market. It was Pets.com against PetStore.com against Petopia.com, and many others. Each company was so focused on beating the others that they forgot to think about whether selling pet supplies online was a good idea at all. Winning is great, but everyone loses when the fight isn’t worth it. When Pets.com went under after the dot-com crash, $300 million in investments vanished with it.

Sometimes, rivalry just gets weird and distracting. Take the feud between Larry Ellison, the co-founder and CEO of Oracle, and Tom Siebel, a top seller at Oracle who later started his own company, Siebel Systems. Ellison was furious at what he saw as Siebel’s betrayal, and Siebel didn’t like being in Ellison’s shadow. They were very similar—both driven Chicagoans who loved to sell and hated losing—so their anger ran deep. In the late ’90s, they tried to sabotage each other. At one point, Ellison sent tons of ice cream sandwiches to Siebel’s office to lure his employees away. The message on the wrappers said, “Summer is near. Oracle is here. To brighten your day and your career.”

Oddly, Oracle seemed to want enemies. Ellison believed it was good to have a rival that was big enough to motivate employees but not so big that it could actually hurt the company. So, he probably enjoyed it when a small database company called Informix put up a billboard near Oracle’s headquarters that said: “CAUTION: DINOSAUR CROSSING.” Another Informix sign on the highway said: “YOU’VE JUST PASSED REDWOOD SHORES. SO DID WE.” Oracle responded with a billboard that suggested Informix’s software was slower than snails.
