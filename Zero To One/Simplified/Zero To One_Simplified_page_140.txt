THE RETURN OF THE KING

When the legal issues were ending Bill Gates’s control over Microsoft, Steve Jobs came back to Apple and showed how important a founder is to a company. Jobs and Gates were very different. Jobs was creative, liked closed systems, and focused on making great products. Gates was more of a businessman, kept things open, and wanted to be in charge of everything. But both of them were outsiders who pushed their companies to do amazing things that others couldn’t.

Jobs was a college dropout who often went barefoot and didn’t care much about personal hygiene. He had a unique personality that made people either love him or think he was weird. Some of his odd habits, like only eating apples, might have been part of a bigger plan. However, in 1985, things went wrong for him when Apple’s board kicked him out because he didn’t get along with the new CEO they brought in to manage the company.

When Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he showed that creating new value in business isn’t something that can just be done by following a formula. The experienced leaders before him had almost driven Apple into bankruptcy. That year, Michael Dell even said he would just shut Apple down and give the money back to the investors. But Jobs changed everything by launching the iPod in 2001, the iPhone in 2007, and the iPad in 2010, before he had to leave in 2011 due to health issues. By the next year, Apple became the most valuable company in the world.

Apple’s success relied heavily on Jobs’s unique vision. This shows how companies that create new tech can sometimes feel more like old kingdoms than modern businesses. A strong founder can make important decisions, inspire loyalty, and plan for the long run. On the other hand, big companies run by many professionals can last a long time, but they often only think about short-term goals.
