THE ENGINEERING QUESTION

A top tech company should have technology that is way better than anything else out there. But companies that focus on clean technology often don’t make improvements that are 2 times better, let alone 10 times better. Sometimes, their products are even worse than what they’re trying to replace. 

For example, Solyndra made new solar cells that are shaped like cylinders. But these cylindrical cells are only about 1/π as good as flat solar cells because they don’t catch as much sunlight. The company tried to fix this by using mirrors to reflect more sunlight onto the panels, but it’s tough to recover from starting with something that’s not as good.

Companies need to aim for being 10 times better because small improvements usually don’t help the customers much. Imagine you create a new wind turbine that’s 20% more efficient than the ones we already have. That sounds cool, but lab tests don’t show how it will perform in the real world, where there are costs and risks. Even if your turbine really is 20% better for the person who buys it, people might doubt your claims because they’ve heard too many overhyped promises before. Only when your product is 10 times better can you really prove to customers that it’s worth it.
