Materials, fun speeches, high prices, and even simple designs can all be copied. But these tricks only work if there’s something solid underneath. Apple has a mix of special technologies, both in hardware (like better touchscreen materials) and software (like touchscreen designs made for specific materials). They make products in such large amounts that they can control the prices of the materials they buy. Plus, they have a strong network effect from their content ecosystem: lots of developers create apps for Apple devices because there are hundreds of millions of users, and those users stick around because that’s where the apps are. These advantages are less obvious than Apple’s shiny brand, but they are the real reasons why Apple’s branding helps keep its monopoly strong.

Starting with a brand instead of real substance can be risky. Since Marissa Mayer became CEO of Yahoo! in 2012, she has tried to make the once-popular internet company cool again. Yahoo! shared Mayer’s plan in a tweet that said it’s all about “people then products then traffic then revenue.” The idea is that people will come for the cool factor: Yahoo! changed its logo to look better, bought trendy startups like Tumblr, and got media attention because of Mayer’s fame. But the big question is what products Yahoo! will actually make. When Steve Jobs came back to Apple, he didn’t just make it a fun place to work; he cut down on product lines to focus on the few chances for big improvements. No tech company can succeed just on branding alone.
