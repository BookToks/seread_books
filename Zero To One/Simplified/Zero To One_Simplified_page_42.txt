Materials, fun speeches, high prices, and even simple designs can all be copied. But these tricks only work if there’s something solid behind them. Apple has a bunch of special technologies, both in hardware (like better touchscreen materials) and software (like touchscreen designs made for those materials). They make products on a huge scale, which helps them control the prices of what they buy. Plus, they have a strong network effect from their content: lots of developers create apps for Apple devices because there are hundreds of millions of users, and those users stick around because that’s where the apps are. These advantages are less obvious than Apple’s shiny brand, but they are the real reasons why the branding helps Apple stay on top.

Starting with a brand instead of real substance is risky. Ever since Marissa Mayer became the CEO of Yahoo! in 2012, she has tried to bring back the once-popular internet company by making it cool again. In one tweet, Yahoo! laid out Mayer’s plan as a chain reaction: “people then products then traffic then revenue.” The idea is that people will come for the cool factor: Yahoo! changed its logo to look better, bought trendy startups like Tumblr, and got media attention because of Mayer’s fame. But the big question is what products Yahoo! will actually make. When Steve Jobs came back to Apple, he didn’t just make it a cool place to work; he cut down on product lines to focus on a few chances for huge improvements. No tech company can succeed just by having a good brand.
