WHERE KINGS COME FROM

Extreme leaders have always been part of human history. Old myths are full of them. Oedipus is a classic example of someone who was both an insider and an outsider. He was left alone as a baby and grew up in a strange place, but he became a great king and figured out the riddle of the Sphinx.

Romulus and Remus were born from a royal family but were abandoned as babies. When they found out who they really were, they wanted to start a city. However, they couldn’t agree on where to build it. When Remus crossed the line that Romulus had set for Rome, Romulus killed him, saying, “Anyone who jumps over my wall will meet the same fate.” Romulus was both a lawmaker and a lawbreaker, a criminal and the king who created Rome, making him a complicated figure.

Most people aren’t like Oedipus or Romulus. No matter what they were really like, the stories we tell about them focus on their extremes. But why did ancient cultures care so much about these extraordinary people? Famous people, whether good or bad, have always represented how the public feels. They get praised when things are going well and blamed when things go wrong. Early societies had a big problem: they could fall apart from fighting if they didn’t find a way to keep peace. So, when disasters or conflicts happened, it helped to blame one person that everyone could agree on: a scapegoat.

What makes a good scapegoat? Like founders, scapegoats are also extreme and complicated figures. On one hand, a scapegoat is weak; they can’t stop what’s happening to them. But on the other hand, by taking the blame, they can help calm down the community, making them powerful in a different way. 

Before being punished, scapegoats were often treated like gods. The Aztecs saw their victims as earthly versions of the gods they sacrificed to. They would dress them in fancy clothes and treat them like royalty until their time was up, and then they would sacrifice them. This is where the idea of kings comes from: every king was seen as a living god, and every god was a king who was killed. Maybe every modern king is just a scapegoat who has managed to avoid their own downfall for a while.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how extreme leaders and scapegoats have shaped societies throughout history. It highlights figures like Oedipus and Romulus, showing how they represent both power and vulnerability. Scapegoats, often blamed for society's problems, play a crucial role in maintaining peace.
