WHERE KINGS COME FROM

Extreme leaders have always been part of human history. Old myths are full of them. Oedipus is a classic example: he was left alone as a baby and grew up in a different place, but he became a great king and figured out the Sphinx's riddle.

Romulus and Remus were born into royal families but were abandoned as babies. When they found out who they really were, they decided to start a city. But they couldn’t agree on where to build it. When Remus crossed the line that Romulus had set for Rome, Romulus killed him, saying, “Anyone who jumps over my wall will meet the same fate.” Romulus was both a lawmaker and a lawbreaker, a criminal and the king who shaped Rome, making him a confusing mix of insider and outsider.

Regular people aren’t like Oedipus or Romulus. No matter what they were really like, the stories we tell only remember their extreme traits. But why did ancient cultures care so much about these extraordinary people?

Famous and infamous figures have always reflected what people feel: they get praised when things are good and blamed when things go wrong. Early societies had one big problem: they could fall apart from fighting if they didn’t find a way to stop it. So, when disasters or conflicts happened, it helped to blame one person everyone could agree on: a scapegoat.

What makes a good scapegoat? Like founders, scapegoats are extreme and complicated. On one hand, a scapegoat is weak; they can’t stop themselves from being blamed. On the other hand, by taking the blame, they can help calm the community, making them the most powerful person in a way.

Before being punished, scapegoats were often treated like gods. The Aztecs saw their victims as earthly versions of their gods. They would dress them in fancy clothes and treat them like royalty until their short reign ended with a sacrifice. This is where the idea of kings comes from: every king was seen as a living god, and every god was a king who was killed. Maybe every modern king is just a scapegoat who has managed to avoid their own downfall for now.
