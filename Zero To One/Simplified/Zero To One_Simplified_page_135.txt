WHERE KINGS COME FROM

Extreme leaders have always been part of human history. In ancient stories, we see examples of them. Oedipus is a classic case: he was left alone as a baby and grew up in a different place, but he became a great king who solved the Sphinx's riddle.

Romulus and Remus were born into a royal family but were abandoned as babies. When they found out they were royalty, they wanted to start a city. They disagreed on where to build it. When Remus crossed the line that Romulus had set for Rome, Romulus killed him, saying, “Anyone who jumps over my wall will meet the same fate.” Romulus was both a lawmaker and a lawbreaker, making him a complicated figure.

Most people aren’t like Oedipus or Romulus. The stories we tell about them focus on their extreme traits. But why did ancient cultures care so much about these extraordinary people? Famous figures, whether good or bad, often represent what people feel. They are celebrated in good times and blamed in bad times. Early societies had a big problem: they could fall apart due to fighting unless they found a way to keep the peace. So, when disasters or conflicts happened, it helped to blame one person everyone could agree on: a scapegoat.

What makes a good scapegoat? Like founders, scapegoats are often extreme and complex. They are usually weak and can’t stop what’s happening to them. But by taking the blame, they can actually help calm the community. 

Before being punished, scapegoats were sometimes treated like gods. The Aztecs saw their victims as earthly versions of their gods. These people would be dressed up and treated like royalty until their time was up, and then they would be sacrificed. This idea connects to kingship: every king was seen as a living god, and every god was a king who had been killed. Maybe every modern king is just a scapegoat who has managed to avoid their fate for a while.
