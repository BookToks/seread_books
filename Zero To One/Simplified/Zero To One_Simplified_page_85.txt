VESTED INTERESTS

Startups don’t have to pay high salaries because they can offer something better: a share of the company. 

Equity, or ownership, is a way to get people focused on making the company better in the future. But to make sure equity builds commitment instead of causing problems, it has to be given out carefully. 

Giving everyone the same amount of shares is usually a bad idea. Each person has different skills and roles, so equal shares can feel unfair from the start. On the flip side, giving different amounts right away can also seem unfair. If people feel upset about this early on, it can hurt the company, and there’s no perfect way to avoid these issues.

This problem gets worse as more people join the company. Early employees often get more equity because they take bigger risks, but some later employees might be just as important for the company’s success. For example, a secretary who joined eBay in 1996 could have made 200 times more than her boss who joined in 1999. A graffiti artist who painted Facebook’s office in 2005 got stock worth $200 million, while a talented engineer who joined in 2010 might have only made $2 million. Since it’s impossible to be perfectly fair when giving out ownership, founders should keep the details private.

Sending an email to everyone about their ownership would be like dropping a bomb in the office.

Not everyone wants equity. At PayPal, we once hired a consultant who was supposed to help us make big business deals. The only thing he managed to negotiate was a $5,000 daily cash salary; he wouldn’t take stock options. Even though there are stories of startup chefs becoming millionaires, many people find equity unattractive. It’s not cash, and it’s tied to one specific company. If that company fails, the equity is worthless.

Equity is a strong tool because of these downsides. Anyone who prefers owning part of your company over getting cash shows they care about the long term and want to help increase the company’s value. Equity isn’t perfect, but it’s the best way for a founder to keep everyone on the same page.
