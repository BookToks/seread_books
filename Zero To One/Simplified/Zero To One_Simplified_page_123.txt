THE MYTH OF SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP

Cleantech entrepreneurs wanted more than just the usual business success. The cleantech boom was the biggest trend—and also the biggest failure—in the world of “social entrepreneurship.” This idea of mixing business with helping people starts with the thought that companies and nonprofits are usually very different. Companies have a lot of power but only care about making money, while nonprofits try to help people but don’t have much influence in the economy. Social entrepreneurs want to bring the best of both worlds together and “do well by doing good.” But most of the time, they end up failing at both.

The confusion between social goals and money goals doesn’t help. But the confusion around the word “social” is an even bigger issue. If something is “socially good,” does that mean it’s actually good for society, or just looks good to people? Anything that gets a lot of praise is usually pretty basic, like the idea of green energy.

We’re not held back by greedy companies or good-hearted nonprofits; instead, we’re stuck because both are often the same. Just like companies copy each other, nonprofits tend to focus on the same issues. Cleantech shows this clearly: there are tons of similar products all trying to achieve one vague goal.

Doing something different is what really helps society—and it’s also what can help a business make money by owning a new market. The best projects are often ignored, not celebrated by a crowd; the best problems to tackle are usually the ones that no one else is willing to try to solve.
