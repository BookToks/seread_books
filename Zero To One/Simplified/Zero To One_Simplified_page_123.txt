THE MYTH OF SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP

Cleantech entrepreneurs wanted more than just the usual business success. The cleantech boom was a huge deal, but it also turned out to be a big failure in the world of “social entrepreneurship.” This idea mixes business and charity, thinking that companies and nonprofits are totally different. Companies have a lot of power but only care about making money, while nonprofits want to help people but don’t have much influence. Social entrepreneurs try to bring the best of both together and “do well by doing good.” But most of the time, they end up failing at both.

The confusion between social goals and money goals makes things harder. The word “social” is tricky too: if something is “socially good,” does that mean it really helps society, or just looks good to people? Anything that gets a lot of praise is usually pretty basic, like the general idea of green energy.

We’re not stuck because companies are greedy and nonprofits are good; we’re stuck because both are too similar. Just like companies copy each other, nonprofits often focus on the same issues. Cleantech shows this clearly: there are tons of similar products all chasing one vague goal. 

Doing something unique is what really helps society—and it’s also what can help a business make money by owning a new market. The best projects often get ignored, and the biggest challenges are usually the ones that no one else wants to tackle.
