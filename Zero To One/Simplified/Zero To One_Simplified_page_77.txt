WHAT TO DO WITH SECRETS

When you find out a secret, you have to decide: Should you tell someone? Or should you keep it to yourself? 

It really depends on the secret. Some secrets can be pretty dangerous. As Faust says to Wagner, people who show their true feelings often get hurt. If your beliefs are different from what most people think, it’s usually not a good idea to share everything you know with everyone. 

So, who should you tell? Only the people you really need to tell, and not more than that. There’s a balance between telling no one and telling everyone, and that balance is usually a small group of trusted people. The best business leaders understand this: every successful business is built around a secret that others don’t know. When you share your secret with someone, they become part of your team. 

As Tolkien wrote in The Lord of the Rings, life is like a long journey. The path we follow has been traveled by many before us, and it seems to go on forever. But later in the story, he adds that there might be new paths or hidden doors waiting just around the corner. Even if we miss them today, we might find them tomorrow and explore new adventures. 

So remember, the journey doesn’t have to go on forever. Don’t be afraid to take those hidden paths.
