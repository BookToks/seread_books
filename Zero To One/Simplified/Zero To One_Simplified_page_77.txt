WHAT TO DO WITH SECRETS

When you discover a secret, you have to decide: Should you tell someone? Or should you keep it to yourself? 

It really depends on the secret. Some secrets can be really risky. As Faust says to Wagner, people who show their true feelings often get hurt. If your beliefs are different from what most people think, it’s usually not smart to share everything you know.

So, who should you tell? Only the people you really need to, and not everyone. There’s a balance between telling no one and telling everyone, and that’s where a good group comes in. The best business leaders understand this: every successful company is built on a secret that outsiders don’t know. When you share your secret with someone, they become part of your team.

As Tolkien wrote in The Lord of the Rings, life is like a long journey. The path we follow has been walked by many before us, and it seems to go on forever. But later in the story, he mentions that there might be new paths or hidden doors waiting for us. Even if we miss them today, we might find them tomorrow and explore new adventures.

So remember, the journey doesn’t have to go on forever. Sometimes, you should take the hidden paths.
