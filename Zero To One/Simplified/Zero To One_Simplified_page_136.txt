Celebrities are often seen as “American royalty.” We even give special titles to our favorite stars: Elvis Presley was called the king of rock, Michael Jackson was the king of pop, and Britney Spears was the pop princess. 

But things didn’t always stay great for them. Elvis ended up having a rough life in the ’70s and died alone, overweight, on his toilet. Now, his impersonators don’t look cool like he used to. Michael Jackson went from being a loved child star to someone who struggled with drugs and looked very different from his younger self. People were fascinated by his problems. 

Britney’s story is the wildest. We made her a superstar when she was just a teenager, but then her life took a turn for the worse. She had a breakdown, shaved her head, and faced issues with eating and a big court case about her kids. Was she always a bit off? Did the fame mess with her mind? Or did she act out to get more attention?

For some stars, dying can actually make them more famous. Many musicians have died at age 27, like Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, and Kurt Cobain. This group is known as the “27 Club.” Before she died in 2011, Amy Winehouse sang, “They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said, ‘No, no, no.’” Maybe rehab didn’t seem appealing to her because of how tough it was.
