After 10 years, the investment results won’t show a mix of winners and losers; instead, there will be one big winner and everything else will be small. 

But even though the final results seem clear, that’s not how things feel day-to-day. Investors spend most of their time putting money into new businesses and helping companies that are just starting out, so most of the companies they deal with are pretty average. 

The differences that investors and entrepreneurs notice every day are usually about how well companies are doing compared to each other, not about one company being super successful while others fail completely. Plus, since no one wants to give up on their investments, venture capitalists often end up spending more time on the companies that are struggling than on the ones that are doing really well.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** Investors see that after 10 years, one investment usually stands out as the best. Day-to-day, they focus on average companies and often spend more time helping struggling ones than the successful ones.
