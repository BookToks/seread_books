EVERYBODY SELLS

Some people think that selling is something only salespeople do, but that's not true. We all like to think we make our own choices and that we’re not influenced by sales tactics. 

In reality, everyone has something to sell. It doesn’t matter if you work for someone else, run your own business, or invest in companies. Even if you’re just a solo worker with your laptop, you’re still selling something. 

Take a look around. If you don’t see any salespeople, guess what? You are the salesperson.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** Everyone sells something, whether they realize it or not. It doesn't matter if you're an employee, a business owner, or just working alone; we all influence and sell ideas in our own ways.
