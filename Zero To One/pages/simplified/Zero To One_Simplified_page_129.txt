THE DIFFERENCE ENGINE

Some people are really strong, some are weak, some are super smart, and some aren’t so bright—but most people are somewhere in between. If you were to draw a graph showing where everyone fits, it would look like a bell curve.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** This passage talks about how people have different strengths and weaknesses, and how most fall in the middle. It suggests that founders often have more extreme traits compared to the general population.
