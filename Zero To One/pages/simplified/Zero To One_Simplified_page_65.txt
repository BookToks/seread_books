WHY PEOPLE DON’T SEE THE POWER LAW

Why do professional venture capitalists (VCs) sometimes miss the power law? One reason is that it only becomes obvious over time, and even tech investors often focus too much on what's happening right now. 

Think about a firm that invests in 10 companies that could become super successful—this is already a pretty careful choice. At first, these companies will all seem pretty similar before they start to grow really fast. 

As time goes on, some companies will fail while others start to do well. Their values will start to change a lot, but it won’t be easy to tell the difference between fast growth and steady growth at first.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** Professional VCs often overlook the power law because it becomes clear only over time. Initially, companies may seem similar, but as time passes, some will succeed and others will fail, making growth patterns hard to see.
