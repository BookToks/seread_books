The most famous people in the world are also creators. Instead of starting a business, every celebrity builds their own personal brand. 

Take Lady Gaga, for example. She’s one of the most influential people alive today. But is she even a real person? Everyone knows her stage name, but not many people care about her real name. She wears such crazy outfits that anyone else would probably get sent to a mental hospital. Gaga wants you to think she was “born this way,” which is also the name of her second album and its biggest song. But nobody is born looking like a zombie with horns on their head, so Gaga must have created this wild image herself. 

But then again, what kind of person would do that to themselves? Definitely not someone normal. So maybe Gaga really was born that way after all.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** Celebrities like Lady Gaga create their own personal brands, often presenting unique and wild images. Gaga's outrageous style and persona make people wonder if she’s truly real or just a creation of her own making.
