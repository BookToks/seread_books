People hoped for a future with a four-day workweek, super cheap energy, and even vacations on the moon. But that didn’t happen. 

Smartphones keep us glued to our screens and make us forget that the world around us hasn’t changed much. The only big improvements since the 1950s are in computers and communication. 

This doesn’t mean our parents were wrong to dream of a better future; they just thought it would happen automatically. Now, it’s up to us to imagine and create new technologies that can make the 21st century better and more peaceful than the 20th century.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** People had big dreams for the future, but many didn’t come true. While technology has improved, our surroundings haven’t changed much. Now, we need to create new tech to make the future better.
