When we think about the future, we want it to be better. There are two ways this can happen. 

Horizontal progress is when we copy things that already work—like going from 1 to n. This is easy to picture because we see it all the time. Vertical progress is different; it means creating something completely new—going from 0 to 1. This is harder to imagine because it involves doing something no one has done before. For example, if you take one typewriter and make 100, that’s horizontal progress. But if you take a typewriter and create a word processor, that’s vertical progress.

On a bigger scale, horizontal progress is called globalization. This is when you take ideas that work in one place and make them work everywhere. A good example is China, which has a plan to become like the United States today. They have been copying things that work in developed countries, like 19th-century railroads and 20th-century air conditioning. Sometimes they skip steps, like going straight to wireless technology without using landlines, but they are still copying.

Vertical progress, or going from 0 to 1, is all about technology. In recent years, the fast growth of information technology has made Silicon Valley the center of tech innovation. But technology isn’t just about computers. In a broader sense, any new and better way of doing things can be considered technology.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** The future can improve through two types of progress: horizontal, which copies existing ideas, and vertical, which creates new ones. Globalization spreads successful ideas worldwide, while technology focuses on innovation. Both are essential for a better future.
