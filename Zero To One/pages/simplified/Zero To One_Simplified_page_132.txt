Take Sir Richard Branson, the billionaire who started the Virgin Group. He’s a natural entrepreneur because he began his first business at 16 and created Virgin Records at 22. But some things about him, like his wild lion’s mane hairstyle, are definitely not something he was born with. 

Branson has worked hard to build his image. Whether he’s kiteboarding with naked supermodels for fun or to get attention, the media loves him. They call him “The Virgin King,” “The Undisputed King of PR,” “The King of Branding,” and even “The King of the Desert and Space.” When Virgin Atlantic Airways served drinks with ice cubes shaped like his face, he got the nickname “The Ice King.”

So, is Branson just a regular businessman who gets a lot of media hype thanks to a good PR team? Or is he a natural at branding who knows how to get attention? It’s tough to say—maybe he’s a bit of both.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sir Richard Branson is a billionaire and entrepreneur known for starting Virgin Records young. His unique style and media presence raise questions about whether he’s just a savvy businessman or a true branding genius.
