In 1995, eBay didn’t need everyone in the world to use it right away. It worked great for people really into things like Beanie Babies. After it took over that market, eBay didn’t rush to sell big items like sports cars. Instead, it kept focusing on small hobbyists until it became the go-to place for trading stuff online, no matter what it was.

But eBay learned that growing can have hidden challenges. Like other marketplaces, eBay naturally became a leader because buyers go where the sellers are. However, they found that auctions work best for unique items like coins and stamps. For regular items like pencils or tissues, people prefer to just buy them from Amazon. So, while eBay is still a strong player, it’s not as big as people thought it would be back in 2004.

Taking things step by step is important, and it requires patience to grow slowly. The best companies often start by dominating a specific niche before moving into related markets.

In Silicon Valley, everyone is obsessed with the idea of “disruption.” Originally, this meant using new tech to create cheaper products that could eventually beat the more expensive ones. For example, PCs disrupted the market for big mainframe computers. Now, mobile devices might be doing the same to PCs.

But lately, “disruption” has become a trendy buzzword that doesn’t really mean much. This is a problem because it can change how entrepreneurs see themselves in a competitive world. The term was meant to describe how new companies threaten older ones, so if startups focus too much on being disruptive, they might just see themselves as fighting against established companies. If your business is all about opposing others, it’s probably not truly new and might not become a leader.

Disruption also gets attention, but it can lead to trouble. Disruptive kids often get in trouble at school, and disruptive companies can end up in fights they can’t win. Take Napster, for example. Its founders, Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker, aimed to shake up the music industry in 1999 and even made the cover of Time magazine. But just a year and a half later, they were in bankruptcy court.

PayPal could be seen as disruptive, but we didn’t directly challenge any big competitors. We did take some business from Visa by making online payments popular, but we actually helped grow the overall market for payments. This was a positive change, unlike Napster’s struggle with the music industry. So, when you plan to grow into new markets, try not to disrupt; avoid competition whenever you can.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** eBay grew by focusing on niche markets before expanding, while the idea of "disruption" has changed from a meaningful concept to a buzzword. Companies should avoid direct competition and instead focus on creating positive changes in their markets.
