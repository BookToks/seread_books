IF YOU BUILD IT, WILL THEY COME? 

Even though sales are everywhere, a lot of people don’t realize how important they are. In Silicon Valley, people often ignore this even more. The famous book The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy describes how our planet was formed as a way to escape from salespeople. When a disaster happens, humanity leaves their home on three huge ships. The smart people, leaders, and achievers go on the A Ship; the salespeople and consultants get on the B Ship; and the workers and artists take the C Ship. The B Ship leaves first, and everyone on it is happy. But the salespeople don’t know they’ve been tricked: the A Ship and C Ship people always thought the B Ship people were useless, so they planned to get rid of them. In the end, it’s the B Ship that lands on Earth.

In stories, distribution might not matter, but in real life, it does. We often underestimate how important distribution is, which means everything needed to sell a product. This is because we think like the A Ship and C Ship people: that salespeople and other “middlemen” just get in the way, and that products should sell themselves. The idea from the movie Field of Dreams is really popular in Silicon Valley, where engineers focus more on creating cool things instead of selling them. But just building something doesn’t mean customers will come. You have to work to make that happen, and it’s tougher than it seems.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sales are crucial for success, but many people, especially in Silicon Valley, overlook this. Just building a great product isn’t enough; you need to actively sell it, which is often harder than expected.
