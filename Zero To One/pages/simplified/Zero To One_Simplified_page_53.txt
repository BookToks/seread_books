OUR INDEFINITELY OPTIMISTIC WORLD

Indefinite Finance

If we think about a really positive future, we might picture engineers building underwater cities or living in space. But an indefinitely optimistic future is more about having bankers and lawyers. Finance is all about this indefinite thinking because it’s a way to make money even when you don’t know how to create real wealth. Many smart college grads don’t have a clear career plan, so they go to Wall Street. Once they get to places like Goldman Sachs, they realize that even in finance, things are still uncertain. It’s optimistic because no one would invest if they thought they’d lose, but the truth is that the market is random. You can’t know for sure what will happen, so spreading out your investments becomes super important.

The weirdness of finance can be surprising. Think about what happens when successful business owners sell their companies. What do they do with the money? In a world focused on finance, it usually goes like this:

- The founders don’t know what to do, so they hand it over to a big bank.
- The bankers don’t know either, so they spread it out across different investors.
- Those investors are also unsure, so they buy a bunch of stocks.
  
Companies try to raise their stock prices by making money. If they succeed, they might give out dividends or buy back their shares, and the whole cycle starts again.

At no point does anyone really know what to do with the money in the real world. But in an indefinite world, people actually like having endless options; money feels more valuable than anything you could spend it on. Only in a certain future does money serve a purpose, rather than being the goal itself.

Indefinite Politics

Politicians have always had to answer to the public during elections, but now they pay attention to what people think all the time. Thanks to modern polling, politicians can shape their image to match what people already believe, and they mostly do just that. Nate Silver’s election predictions are super accurate, but what’s even more surprising is how much attention they get every four years. We’re more interested in what polls say about how people will feel in a few weeks than in big ideas about what the country will look like in 10 or 20 years.

It’s not just about elections—the whole government has become uncertain, too. In the past, the government could tackle big issues like nuclear weapons and space travel. But now, after 40 years of uncertainty, the government mainly provides insurance. Our solutions to major problems are things like Medicare and Social Security, along with a bunch of other payment programs. It makes sense that spending on these programs has been higher than other spending since 1975. To increase other spending, we’d need clear plans to fix specific issues. But with the uncertain way we handle entitlement spending, we can’t really do that.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** This passage discusses how finance and politics have become uncertain and focused on short-term options rather than long-term solutions. In finance, people invest without knowing the outcomes, while politicians shape their actions based on current public opinion instead of future visions.
