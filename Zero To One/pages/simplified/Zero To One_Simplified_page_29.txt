Perfect balance might describe most of the universe and even some businesses. But every new idea or product comes from a place that isn’t balanced. In real life, a business succeeds when it does something that no one else can do. So, having a monopoly isn’t a bad thing or an unusual case. It’s actually what every successful business has.

Tolstoy starts his book, *Anna Karenina*, by saying, “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” Business works differently. All successful companies are unique because they solve a special problem. On the other hand, all failed companies share one thing: they couldn’t break away from the competition.

**PAGE SUMMARY:** Successful businesses stand out by solving unique problems, while failed ones struggle against competition. Monopoly isn't bad; it's a sign of success.
