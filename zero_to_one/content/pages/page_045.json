  "simplified_text": "You’ve probably heard about “first mover advantage”: if you’re the first to enter a market, you can grab a big share while others try to catch up. But being first is just a strategy, not the main goal. What really matters is making money in the future, so being the first doesn’t help if someone else comes along and takes your place. \n\nIt’s actually better to be the last mover. This means making the final big improvement in a market and enjoying years or even decades of profits. The best way to do this is to focus on a small area and then grow from there towards your big dreams. In this way, business is a lot like chess. \n\nGrandmaster José Raúl Capablanca said it best: to succeed, “you must study the endgame before everything else.” \n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage explains that being the first in a market isn't as important as making money in the long run. It's better to be the last mover, focusing on a small niche and growing from there, similar to how chess players plan their moves.",
