  "simplified_text": "THE TIMING QUESTION\n\nCleantech entrepreneurs really believed that their moment to shine had come. When Andrew Wilson, the CEO of SpectraWatt, announced his new company in 2008, he said that the solar industry was like the microprocessor industry back in the late 1970s. He thought there was a lot to improve, and he was right about that. But comparing the two industries wasn’t accurate at all.\n\nSince the first microprocessor was made in 1970, computers have improved super fast. Just look at how quickly Intel released new products. On the other hand, the first silicon solar cell was made by Bell Labs in 1954, which is more than 50 years before Wilson made his announcement. Solar technology has gotten better over the years, but it’s been a slow process. Bell's first solar cell had about 6% efficiency, and even today, the best solar cells only reach around 25% efficiency. \n\nIn the mid-2000s, there weren't many signs that the solar market was about to take off. Getting into a slow market can be a smart move, but only if you have a solid and realistic plan to succeed. Unfortunately, the cleantech companies that failed didn’t have that.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Cleantech entrepreneurs thought the solar industry was ready to grow, but they were mistaken. While technology like microprocessors advanced quickly, solar energy improved slowly. Many failed companies didn't have a solid plan to succeed in this slow-moving market.",
