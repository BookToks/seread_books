  "simplified_text": "What’s a better reward for working hard for twenty years than a fancy job that seems great and keeps your options open? \n\nParents of recent graduates often encourage them to follow the usual path. The Baby Boomers, who were born between 1945 and 1955, grew up in a time when things just kept getting better. They got used to things improving without much effort, so they feel like they deserve it. For the first 18 years of their lives, everything got better each year, and it wasn’t because of anything they did. \n\nTechnology was advancing quickly, so Boomers had high hopes but didn’t really plan how to achieve them. Then, in the 1970s, when tech progress slowed down, the rich Boomers still did well because income inequality helped them. While the wealthy Boomers kept getting richer, many others in their generation fell behind. The successful Boomers today don’t see any reason to doubt their positive outlook. Since their careers worked out, they think the same will happen for their kids.\n\nMalcolm Gladwell says you can’t really get why Bill Gates succeeded without knowing about his lucky background: he had a good family, went to a private school with computers, and had a friend like Paul Allen. But maybe you can’t fully understand Gladwell either without knowing he’s a Boomer born in 1963. When Boomers write about why certain people succeed, they often focus on luck. But they overlook the bigger picture: their generation learned to think luck is more important than planning. Gladwell seems to challenge the idea that success is all about individual effort, but his views still reflect the common beliefs of his generation.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how Baby Boomers grew up in a time of easy progress, leading them to believe success comes from luck rather than planning. It highlights how this mindset affects their views on success and their children's futures.",
