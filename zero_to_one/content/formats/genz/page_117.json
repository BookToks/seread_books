  "simplified_text": "THE MONOPOLY QUESTION\n\nIn 2006, a rich tech investor named John Doerr said, “green is the new red, white, and blue.” He could have just said “red.” Doerr pointed out that markets on the internet are worth billions, while energy markets are worth trillions. But he didn’t mention that big markets mean tough and fierce competition. Many people repeated what Doerr said. In the 2000s, I heard a lot of cleantech entrepreneurs start their presentations by talking about these huge trillion-dollar markets, acting like it was a great thing.\n\nCleantech leaders talked about how big the energy market was, saying there was enough for everyone. But each of them thought their own company was the best. In 2006, Dave Pearce, the CEO of a solar company called MiaSolé, told Congress that his company was just one of many strong startups working on a specific type of solar cell. A few minutes later, he boldly claimed that MiaSolé would be the biggest producer of those solar cells in the world within a year. That didn’t happen, and it might not have mattered anyway because thin-film solar cells are just one type out of many. Customers only care about technology if it solves a problem better than others. If you can’t dominate a unique solution in a small market, you’ll face tough competition. That’s what happened to MiaSolé, which was sold in 2013 for much less than what its investors had put in.\n\nThinking you’re special can mess up your chances of success. Imagine you run a solar company that has installed hundreds of solar panel systems, generating 100 megawatts of power. Since the total solar energy production in the U.S. is 950 megawatts, you might feel proud that you own 10.53% of the market. But what if you’re not looking at the U.S. market? What if you should be looking at the global solar market, which has a production capacity of 18 gigawatts? Suddenly, your 100 megawatts makes you a tiny player, owning less than 1% of the market.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** John Doerr highlighted the fierce competition in the trillion-dollar energy market. Many cleantech companies, like MiaSolé, overestimated their uniqueness and faced tough competition. Success depends on solving problems better than others, especially in a global market.",
