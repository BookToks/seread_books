Trying to get customers through ads was too costly. So, we decided to pay people to sign up and even more to get their friends to join. This plan cost us $20 for each new customer, but it helped us grow by 7% every day. That meant our users almost doubled every 10 days. After a few months, we had hundreds of thousands of users and a chance to create a great company by helping people send money for small fees, which was way less than what we spent to get them.\n\nThe first company to grab the best part of a market that can grow quickly usually ends up winning. At PayPal, we didn’t want random users; we wanted the most valuable ones first. We noticed that many immigrants were still using Western Union to send money home, but our product made it super easy. However, those transactions didn’t happen often enough. We needed a smaller group that used money more frequently, and we found it in eBay’s “PowerSellers,” who sold items online. There were about 20,000 of them, and they had auctions ending almost every day, which meant they were always sending and receiving payments. Since eBay’s payment system was really bad, these sellers were excited to try PayPal. Once we became the main payment option for eBay, we were unbeatable.\n\nOne important idea is that some ways to reach customers are way more effective than others. Many new business owners think that doing more will help, but that’s not always true. Just hiring a few salespeople, running some ads, and hoping for the best usually doesn’t work. Most businesses fail not because their product is bad, but because they can’t sell it well. If you can make just one way to reach customers work, you can have a successful business. But if you try many ways and none work, you’re done for.\n\nYour company has to sell more than just its product. You also need to attract good employees and investors. Some people think that if a company is great, people will want to join it automatically. The same goes for getting investors; they won’t just show up because your company is awesome. You need to actively recruit and pitch your ideas. Getting media attention is also important for selling your company to everyone else. Some people don’t trust the media and think ignoring it is better, but that’s a mistake. Just like you can’t expect people to buy a great product without a plan to share it, you can’t assume they will admire your company without a good public relations strategy.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** PayPal grew rapidly by paying users to sign up and refer friends. They targeted eBay sellers for frequent transactions, becoming the main payment option. Success depends on effective distribution strategies and selling the company to employees and investors, not just relying on a great product.",
