  "simplified_text": "LAST MOVER ADVANTAGE\n\nEscaping competition can give you a monopoly, but even a monopoly is only good if it lasts. Look at the New York Times Company and Twitter. Both have a few thousand employees and provide news to millions. But when Twitter went public in 2013, it was valued at $24 billion, which is way more than the Times, even though the Times made $133 million in 2012 while Twitter was losing money. Why was Twitter valued so high?\n\nThe answer is cash flow. It sounds strange since the Times was making money and Twitter wasn't. But a great business is really about how much money it can make in the future. Investors believe Twitter will make a lot of money over the next ten years, while the days of newspapers making big profits are over.\n\nSimply put, a business's value today is based on all the money it will make in the future. To figure out how much a business is worth, you also have to consider that money today is worth more than the same amount in the future.\n\nWhen you compare future cash flows, you can see the big difference between slow-growing businesses and fast-growing startups. Most of the value of slow-growing businesses comes from the near future. An old business like a newspaper might keep its value if it can keep making money for five or six years. But any business with similar options will see its profits drop. Nightclubs or restaurants are good examples: they might make a lot of money now, but their profits will likely go down as customers find newer, cooler places.\n\nTech companies are different. They often lose money at first because it takes time to create valuable products, which means they won’t make money right away. Most of a tech company’s value will come at least 10 to 15 years down the line.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage explains how a business's value is based on its future cash flow. It compares old businesses like newspapers with tech companies, showing that tech firms often take time to grow but can be more valuable in the long run.",
