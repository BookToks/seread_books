Throughout history, small groups of people who share a common goal have made big changes in the world.

In the worst companies, it’s more important to look busy than to actually get things done. If that sounds like your workplace, you might want to leave. On the other hand, a single genius can create amazing art or literature, but they can’t build an entire industry by themselves. Startups believe that working with others is key to getting things done, but they also need to stay small enough to be effective.\n\nIn simple terms, a startup is the biggest group of people you can convince to work on a plan for a better future. The biggest strength of a new company is its fresh ideas. Being small gives them the freedom to think creatively. This book is about the important questions you need to ask to succeed in creating new things. It’s not just a guide or a collection of facts; it’s about thinking differently. Startups must challenge old ideas and rethink how business works from the ground up.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Startups are small groups that create new technology and ideas. They work better than big companies because they can think creatively and take risks. This book focuses on the questions needed to succeed in building new things and encourages fresh thinking.",
