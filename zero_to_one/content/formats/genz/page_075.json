Andrew Wiles showed this when he proved Fermat’s Last Theorem after 358 years of other mathematicians trying and failing. This long struggle might have made people think the task was impossible. Pierre de Fermat guessed in 1637 that there are no whole numbers a, b, and c that can satisfy the equation a^n + b^n = c^n for any whole number n greater than 2. He said he had a proof, but he died without writing it down, so his idea stayed a big mystery in math for a long time. Wiles began working on it in 1986 but kept it a secret until 1993 when he was close to solving it. After nine years of hard work, Wiles proved the idea in 1995. He needed to be smart to succeed, but he also had to believe in secrets.\n\nIf you think something hard is impossible, you won’t even try to achieve it. Believing in secrets is a powerful truth. The real truth is that there are still many secrets to discover, but they will only reveal themselves to those who keep searching. There’s a lot more to do in science, medicine, engineering, and technology. We can aim for big goals that even the smartest people from the Scientific Revolution were afraid to talk about. We could cure diseases like cancer and dementia. We can find new energy sources that stop conflicts over fossil fuels. We can create faster ways to travel around the world, and even learn how to leave Earth and explore new places. But we won’t find any of these secrets unless we really want to know them and push ourselves to look.\n\nThe same goes for business. Amazing companies can be built on hidden secrets about how the world works. Take the Silicon Valley startups that found ways to use resources around us that most people ignore. Before Airbnb, travelers had to pay a lot for hotel rooms, and property owners couldn’t easily rent out their empty spaces. Airbnb saw a chance where others saw nothing. The same is true for rideshare services like Lyft and Uber. Few people thought you could create a billion-dollar business just by connecting people who need rides with drivers. We already had taxis and limousines; only by believing in and searching for secrets could you see the hidden opportunity.\n\nMany internet companies, including Facebook, are often underestimated because they seem so simple. This simplicity actually supports the idea of secrets. If ideas that seem so basic can lead to valuable businesses, there are probably many great companies still waiting to be started.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Secrets can lead to amazing discoveries and opportunities in math, science, and business. Andrew Wiles proved Fermat’s Last Theorem after years of effort, showing that believing in secrets is crucial. Many more secrets remain to be uncovered, and they can lead to groundbreaking advancements and new companies.",
