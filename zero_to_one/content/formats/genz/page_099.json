A new customer might want to be your biggest client, but they usually won’t feel safe signing a big deal right away. Once you have some customers who are happy with your product, you can work your way up to bigger deals.\n\nMost sales aren’t super complicated. The average deal can be between $10,000 and $100,000, and the CEO doesn’t have to do all the selling. The real challenge is figuring out how a small sales team can get the product to a lot of people.\n\nIn 2008, Box had a great way for companies to safely store their data in the cloud. But not many people knew they needed it because cloud computing was still new. That summer, Blake joined Box as their third salesperson to help change that. He started with small groups who had big problems sharing files and built relationships with more users in each company. In 2009, Blake sold a small Box account to the Stanford Sleep Clinic, which needed a secure way to store research data. Now, Stanford gives every student and faculty member a Box account, and the hospital uses it too. If Box had tried to sell a big deal to the university president right away, they wouldn’t have sold anything. A complicated sales strategy could have led to their failure, but personal sales helped them become a huge business.\n\nSometimes, the product itself helps with sales. ZocDoc is a company that helps people find and book doctor appointments online. They charge doctors a few hundred dollars each month to be part of their network. Since each deal is only a few thousand dollars, ZocDoc needs a lot of salespeople, so they even have a team just for hiring more. Selling to doctors not only brings in money but also makes the service better for users. More users attract more doctors, and now over 5 million people use ZocDoc each month. If they keep adding more doctors, they could become a must-have service in the U.S. healthcare system.\n\nThere’s a tricky spot between personal sales and regular advertising. Imagine you create a software service for convenience store owners to manage their inventory. If it costs around $1,000, it might be hard to find a way to reach those small businesses. Even if your product is great, how do you get the word out? Advertising could be too broad or not effective enough. You need personal sales, but you might not have the budget to send someone to talk to every potential customer. This is why many small and medium businesses miss out on tools that larger companies easily use.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Selling to businesses starts small, building relationships before going big. Personal sales can lead to success, as seen with Box and ZocDoc. However, reaching small businesses can be tough without the right approach, often leaving them behind.",
