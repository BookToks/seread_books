It’s tough to tell because people often mix things up when they talk about it. To someone looking in from the outside, all businesses might seem pretty similar, so it’s easy to think there are only small differences between them. But the truth is much clearer. There’s a big difference between perfect competition and a monopoly, and most businesses are closer to one side than we usually think.\n\nThe confusion happens because people tend to describe market situations in ways that benefit them. Both monopolies and competitors have reasons to stretch the truth.\n\nMonopoly Lies\n\nMonopolies lie to protect their interests. They know that boasting about their monopoly can lead to investigations and criticism. Since they want to keep making money without interruptions, they often try to hide their monopoly by making their competition seem stronger than it really is.\n\nTake Google, for example. It doesn’t say it’s a monopoly, but is it? It depends on what we’re talking about. If we look at Google as a search engine, it owned about 68% of the search market as of May 2014. Its closest competitors, Microsoft and Yahoo!, only have about 19% and 10%. If that doesn’t sound powerful enough, remember that “google” is now a word in the Oxford English Dictionary that means to search online. You probably won’t see that happen with Bing anytime soon.\n\nNow, if we think of Google as an advertising company, things look different. The U.S. search engine advertising market is worth $17 billion each year. Online advertising is $37 billion a year. The whole U.S. advertising market is $150 billion, and globally, it’s a massive $495 billion. So, even if Google completely controlled U.S. search engine advertising, it would only have about 3.4% of the global advertising market. From this viewpoint, Google seems like a small player in a competitive field.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how businesses can seem similar but are often very different, especially between monopolies and competitive markets. It uses Google as an example to show how companies can manipulate perceptions about their market power, depending on how you define their business.",
