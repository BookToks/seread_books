  "text": "THE CHALLENGE OF THE FUTURE\n\nWhen I interview someone for a job, I like to ask this question: “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?” \n\nThis question seems easy because it’s simple. But it’s actually really hard to answer. It’s tough because what we learn in school is usually what everyone agrees on. It’s also hard because the person answering has to say something that most people don’t like. Smart ideas are rare, but having the guts to share them is even rarer.\n\nMost of the time, I hear answers like these: “Our school system is broken and needs fixing.” “America is special.” “There is no God.” \n\nThose aren’t great answers. The first two might be true, but lots of people already think that way. The third one just picks a side in a common argument. A good answer should be something like: “Most people believe in x, but the truth is the opposite of x.” I’ll share my answer later in this chapter.\n\nSo, what does this tricky question have to do with the future? In simple terms, the future is just all the moments that haven’t happened yet. But what makes the future special is that it will be different from today. If nothing changes in our society for the next 100 years, then the future is really far away. But if things change a lot in the next ten years, then the future is coming soon. We can’t predict the future perfectly, but we know two things: it’s going to be different, and it will be based on what we have today. Most answers to the tricky question show different ways of looking at the present; good answers help us see what the future might hold.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses a challenging interview question about unpopular truths and its connection to the future. It explains that the future will be different from today and that good answers to the question help us understand potential changes ahead."
