  "simplified_text": "Venture capitalists are people who look for new companies that could be really successful. They collect money from rich people and organizations, put it together in a fund, and invest in tech companies they think will grow in value. If they're right, they get a share of the profits, usually around 20%. A venture fund makes money when the companies it invests in become more valuable and either go public or get bought by bigger companies. These funds usually last about 10 years because it takes time for companies to grow and succeed.\n\nHowever, most of the companies that get venture funding don’t end up going public or getting bought; many fail pretty quickly. Because of these early failures, a venture fund often loses money at first. Venture capitalists hope that the value of their fund will go up a lot in a few years when the successful companies start to grow really fast. The big question is when this growth will happen. For most funds, it might never happen. Most startups fail, and many funds fail along with them. Every venture capitalist knows they need to find the companies that will succeed, but even experienced investors don’t fully understand how different companies can be.\n\nThey often think that venture returns will follow a normal pattern: bad companies fail, average ones don’t change much, and good ones double or quadruple their value. Based on this idea, investors create a mix of different companies, hoping that the successful ones will make up for the failures. But this “spray and pray” method usually leads to a bunch of failures with no successes. This happens because the returns from venture investments don’t follow a normal pattern. Instead, they follow a power law: only a few companies do really well, while most don’t. If you focus too much on having a variety of investments instead of chasing after the few companies that could become extremely valuable, you might miss out on those rare opportunities.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Venture capitalists invest in new tech companies hoping to profit from their growth. Most startups fail, leading to early losses for funds. Successful investments follow a power law, meaning only a few companies achieve huge success, so focusing on finding those few is crucial.",
