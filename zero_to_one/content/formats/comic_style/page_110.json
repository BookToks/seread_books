  "simplified_text": "The other trendy word that shows a focus on replacing things is “big data.” Nowadays, companies really want lots of data, thinking that having more data always means getting better results. But big data can often be useless data. Computers can spot patterns that people might miss, but they can’t really compare patterns from different places or understand complicated behaviors. Useful insights can only come from a human analyst (or from the kind of advanced artificial intelligence that we only see in movies).\n\nWe’ve become fascinated by big data because we think technology is amazing. We get impressed by small things computers can do on their own, but we overlook the big wins that happen when humans and computers work together because those feel less impressive. Tools like Watson, Deep Blue, and better machine learning are cool. But the best companies in the future won’t just ask what problems computers can solve by themselves. Instead, they’ll ask: how can computers help people tackle tough problems?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Companies are obsessed with big data, thinking more data equals better results. However, computers can't fully understand complex behaviors. The future lies in how computers can assist humans in solving difficult problems, rather than working alone.",
