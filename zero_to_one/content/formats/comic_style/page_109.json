  "simplified_text": "Besides helping find terrorists, analysts using Palantir’s software have been able to guess where insurgents hide bombs in Afghanistan. They’ve also helped with big insider trading cases, shut down the largest child pornography ring in the world, assisted the CDC in fighting food-related illnesses, and saved banks and the government a ton of money each year by spotting fraud.\n\nThis advanced software is great, but what really matters are the people using it—analysts, lawyers, scientists, and finance experts. Without them, the software wouldn’t do much. \n\nThink about what professionals do today. Lawyers need to explain solutions to tricky problems in different ways, depending on who they’re talking to. Doctors must understand medical stuff and explain it clearly to patients who don’t know much. Good teachers know their subjects well, but they also have to adjust how they teach based on each student’s interests and learning styles. Computers can help with some of these tasks, but they can’t do them all together effectively.\n\nBetter tech in law, medicine, and education won’t replace professionals; it will help them do even more. \n\nLinkedIn has done this for recruiters. When LinkedIn started in 2003, they didn’t ask recruiters what problems they had or try to create software to replace them. Recruiting is part detective work and part sales. You have to look closely at applicants’ backgrounds, understand their motivations, and convince the best ones to join your team. Replacing all that with a computer would be impossible. Instead, LinkedIn changed how recruiters work. Now, over 97% of recruiters use LinkedIn’s powerful search tools to find job candidates, and it also helps millions of professionals manage their personal brands. If LinkedIn had just tried to replace recruiters, they wouldn’t be successful today.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage explains how advanced software helps professionals in various fields without replacing them. It highlights LinkedIn's role in transforming recruiting and emphasizes the importance of human skills alongside technology.",
