Everyone in your company should work well together.\n\nSome people in Silicon Valley think you can fix this by being a sole owner. Psychologists like Freud and Jung say that our minds can be split, but when you work for yourself, everything is more in sync. The downside is that it limits how big your company can get. It’s tough to grow from nothing without a team.\n\nOthers believe you can achieve perfect teamwork if you hire the right people who can work well without strict rules. They think that a little chaos at work can help shake things up and break old traditions. But the truth is, people aren’t perfect. That’s why leaders and board members have different jobs; it’s also why ownership and investment in a company are clearly defined. You need good people who get along, but you also need a solid structure to keep everyone on the same page for the long haul.\n\nTo understand where problems might come from in a company, it helps to know three things:\n\n- Ownership: Who legally owns the company?\n- Possession: Who runs the company day-to-day?\n- Control: Who makes the big decisions for the company?\n\nIn a typical startup, ownership is shared among founders, employees, and investors. The people who manage and work at the company have possession. And a board of directors, usually made up of founders and investors, has control.\n\nIn theory, this setup should work well. Sharing ownership attracts investors and rewards workers. When people have possession, they feel motivated to get things done. The board helps keep everything in perspective. But in reality, having different people in these roles can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nTo see how this can go wrong, think about the DMV. If you need a new driver’s license, it should be simple. The DMV is a government agency, and we live in a democracy where the power belongs to the people. As a citizen, you “own” the DMV, and your elected officials control it, so you should be able to walk in and get what you need.\n\nBut it doesn’t work that way. We may “own” the DMV, but that’s just a fancy idea. The clerks who actually work there have real power over how things run. Even the governor and lawmakers can’t change much. The DMV often moves slowly and doesn’t really listen to anyone. Bureaucrats can make your experience great or terrible, and reminding them that you’re the boss probably won’t help.\n\nBig companies do better than the DMV, but they can still have issues, especially between ownership and possession. For example, the CEO of a big company like General Motors...\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses the importance of teamwork in companies and how ownership, possession, and control can lead to misunderstandings. It uses the DMV as an example of misalignment between ownership and actual control. Big companies can also face similar issues, highlighting the need for a solid structure.",
