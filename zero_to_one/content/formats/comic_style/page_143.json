  "simplified_text": "With how connected the world is today and the crazy power of modern weapons, it's tough not to wonder if we could handle a big disaster if it happened. This makes us worried about the third scary possibility: a collapse so bad that we might not make it through.\n\nThe last of the four possibilities is the hardest to picture: a fast move towards a much better future.
