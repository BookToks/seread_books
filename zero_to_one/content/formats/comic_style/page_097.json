  "simplified_text": "SALES IS HIDDEN\n\nAll salespeople are like actors: their main job is to convince people, not to be honest. That’s why the term “salesman” can have a negative vibe, and used car dealers are often seen as shady. We usually only dislike the awkward and obvious salespeople—the bad ones. There are many levels of sales skills, ranging from beginners to experts and even masters. There are also sales grandmasters. If you haven’t met any grandmasters, it’s not because they don’t exist; it’s because they are really good at hiding their skills.\n\nTom Sawyer tricked his friends into painting a fence for him, which was a smart move. But getting them to pay him for doing his chores was a grandmaster move, and his friends had no idea. Not much has changed since Twain wrote this in 1876.\n\nLike acting, sales works best when it’s not obvious. That’s why most people in jobs related to selling—like sales, marketing, or advertising—have titles that don’t mention selling. For example, people who sell ads are called “account executives,” and those who sell companies are “investment bankers.” Even politicians sell themselves, but they don’t want to remind us that they’re selling something. \n\nNo matter the job, being good at sales sets the stars apart from the rest. On Wall Street, a new worker starts as an “analyst” with technical skills, but they aim to become a dealmaker. Lawyers may have fancy degrees, but the top law firms are led by the rainmakers who attract big clients. Even professors, who think their knowledge is enough, often envy those who know how to promote themselves. Ideas in history or English don’t just succeed because they’re smart; they need persuasion too. The main reason people underestimate sales is that it’s often hidden in every field, even though it drives so much.\n\nEngineers dream of creating a product that “sells itself.” But anyone who says this about a real product is probably lying: either they’re fooling themselves or they’re trying to sell something, which contradicts their claim. The opposite saying warns that “the best product doesn’t always win.” Economists explain this as “path dependence,” meaning that certain historical events, not just quality, can decide which products become popular. That’s true, but it doesn’t mean the software and keyboards we use today just happened by chance. It’s better to think of selling as a key part of designing your product. If you create something new but don’t have a good way to sell it, you have a bad business, no matter how great the product is.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sales is all about persuasion, not honesty. Many people in sales disguise their roles with fancy titles. Success in any field often comes down to sales skills, and even great products need effective selling strategies to succeed.",
