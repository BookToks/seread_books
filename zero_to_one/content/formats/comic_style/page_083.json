Sometimes, you might need to make exceptions, like hiring outside lawyers and accountants. But if someone doesn’t own stock options or get a regular paycheck from your company, they might not be on the same page as you. They could focus more on short-term gains instead of helping you build for the future. That’s why hiring consultants usually doesn’t work.\n\nPart-time workers also don’t fit well. Even having people work from home can cause problems because they might not feel as connected when they’re not together every day. When you’re thinking about bringing someone onto your team, you need to be clear about it. Ken Kesey was right: you’re either on the bus or off the bus.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** It's important to have full-time, committed people in your company. Part-time workers or those not fully invested can create issues. When deciding on new team members, make sure they are all in, just like being on a bus together.",
