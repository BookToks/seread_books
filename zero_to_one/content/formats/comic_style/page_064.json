  "text": "This graph shows the big difference between what people think and what’s really happening. \n\nAt Founders Fund, we see a clear pattern: Facebook was our best investment in 2005, and it made more money than all the other investments combined. Palantir, our second-best investment, is also expected to make more money than all the other investments, except for Facebook. This uneven pattern isn’t just a one-time thing; we see it in all our funds. The biggest secret in venture capital is that the top investment in a successful fund usually makes as much or more than all the other investments put together.\n\nThis leads to two strange rules for venture capitalists (VCs). First, they should only invest in companies that could make back the entire value of the fund. This rule is tough because it cuts out most possible investments. Even successful companies usually don’t make that much money. This brings us to the second rule: since the first rule is so strict, there can’t be any other rules.\n\nNow, think about what happens if you ignore the first rule. For example, Andreessen Horowitz invested $250,000 in Instagram in 2010. When Facebook bought Instagram two years later for $1 billion, they made $78 million, which is a huge return. But it’s not enough for them because they have a $1.5 billion fund. If they only invested $250,000, they would need to find 19 more companies like Instagram just to break even. That’s why investors usually put in a lot more money into companies they believe in. \n\nVCs need to find a few companies that can grow really big and support them with all their resources. No one can know for sure which companies will succeed, so even the best VC firms have a mix of investments. However, every company in a good venture portfolio must have the potential to grow a lot. At Founders Fund, we focus on five to seven companies that we believe could become multibillion-dollar businesses. If you start thinking about investing as just a way to spread out risk, it can feel more like playing the lottery. And once you think you’re playing the lottery, you’re already getting ready to lose.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage explains how venture capitalists invest in companies, focusing on the idea that the best investments often make more money than all others combined. It highlights strict rules for investing and the risks involved, comparing it to playing the lottery."
