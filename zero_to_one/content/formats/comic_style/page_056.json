  "simplified_text": "Biotech startups are a good example of thinking without clear answers. Researchers try out different ideas that might work instead of focusing on solid theories about how our bodies work. Biologists say they have to do this because understanding biology is really tough. They point out that IT startups are easier because we created computers and know how they should work. But with biotech, we didn’t make our bodies, and the more we discover, the more complicated they seem.\n\nNow, some people wonder if the real challenge of biology is just an excuse for biotech startups to avoid clear plans for their businesses. Many people involved think things will eventually work out, but few want to fully commit to a specific company to make it successful. This starts with professors who often choose to be part-time consultants instead of full-time workers, even for biotech startups that come from their own research. Then, others start to copy this unclear attitude. Some people argue that strict rules hold biotech back—and they do—but the lack of clear goals might be an even bigger problem for the future of biotech.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Biotech startups often experiment without clear plans because biology is complex. Many involved expect things to work out eventually but hesitate to fully commit. This unclear approach may be a bigger challenge than regulations for the future of biotech.",
