It had to be because in Beijing, the air was so polluted that people couldn’t see from one building to another, and breathing the air was dangerous. In Bangladesh, people were suffering from poisoned water, which the New York Times called “the biggest mass poisoning in history.” In the U.S., hurricanes like Ivan and Katrina were seen as warnings of the destruction that global warming could bring. Al Gore urged everyone to tackle these issues with the same seriousness as if countries were preparing for war. People got to work: entrepreneurs launched thousands of cleantech companies, and investors put over $50 billion into them. This was the start of the effort to clean up the planet.\n\nBut it didn’t go as planned. Instead of a healthier Earth, we ended up with a huge cleantech bubble. Solyndra is the most well-known failure, but many cleantech companies faced similar fates—over 40 solar manufacturers went out of business or declared bankruptcy in 2012 alone. The main index tracking alternative energy companies showed a big drop in value. \n\nWhy did cleantech fail? Some conservatives think they know the answer: they believe that once the government prioritized green energy, it became a problem. However, there are still valid reasons to focus on energy. The truth about cleantech is more complicated than just blaming the government. Most cleantech companies failed because they overlooked one or more of the seven important questions that every business needs to answer.\n\n1. The Engineering Question: Can you create groundbreaking technology instead of just making small improvements?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** In the early 2000s, clean technology seemed promising due to pollution and climate change. However, many cleantech companies failed, leading to a bubble burst. The reasons for this failure are complex and involve more than just government issues, including the need for innovative technology.",
