  "text": "Bob Dylan once said that if you're not busy being born, you're busy dying. If he's right, being born isn't just a one-time thingâ€”you might keep doing it in a way, at least in a creative sense. But when it comes to a company, the founding moment only happens once: at the very beginning, you get to set the rules that will help everyone work together to create value in the future.\n\nThe best companies stay open to new ideas, which is something that usually happens at the start. This leads to another important idea about founding: it lasts as long as a company keeps creating new things, and it ends when that stops. If you nail the founding moment, you can do more than just build a valuable company; you can guide its future toward creating new things instead of just managing past successes. You might even keep that founding spirit alive forever.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage explains that a company's founding moment is crucial for setting rules and creating value. It emphasizes the importance of staying open to new ideas and continuing to innovate to keep the founding spirit alive."
