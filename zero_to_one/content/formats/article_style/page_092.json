But even if you get it right at first, things will change quickly. Startups need to move fast, so job roles can’t stay the same for long. Plus, job assignments are not just about tasks; they also involve how employees get along with each other.\n\nThe best thing I did as a manager at PayPal was to make sure each person was responsible for just one thing. Each person had their own unique task, and I only judged them on that one thing. I started this to make managing easier, but I noticed something important: it cut down on fights. Most arguments at work happen when people want the same job responsibilities. Startups are especially at risk of this because roles can change a lot in the beginning. Reducing competition helps everyone build better long-term relationships, which is more than just being professional. \n\nHaving a peaceful work environment is crucial for a startup to succeed. When a startup fails, we often think it’s because of tough competition from other companies. But every company has its own challenges, and fighting among employees makes it weak against outside threats. Internal conflict is like a disease: while it might seem like the end comes from something obvious, the real problem is often hidden.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** In a startup, it's important for each employee to have a unique role to reduce competition and conflict. This helps build strong relationships and keeps the company strong against outside threats. Internal peace is key for a startup's survival.",
