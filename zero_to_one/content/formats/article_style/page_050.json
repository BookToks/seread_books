Each new generation of inventors and dreamers did even better than the last. In 1843, people in London got to cross under the River Thames for the first time thanks to a new tunnel. Then in 1869, the Suez Canal made shipping between Europe and Asia much faster by avoiding the long trip around Africa. In 1914, the Panama Canal made it easier to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Even during the Great Depression, the U.S. kept moving forward with progress. The Empire State Building started construction in 1929 and was finished in 1931. The Golden Gate Bridge began in 1933 and was done in 1937. The Manhattan Project kicked off in 1941 and created the first nuclear bomb by 1945. \n\nAmericans kept changing the world even during peaceful times. The Interstate Highway System started being built in 1956, and by 1965, 20,000 miles of new roads were ready for driving. NASA's Apollo Program began in 1961 and sent 12 astronauts to the moon by 1972. \n\nBig ideas weren't just for politicians or scientists. In the late 1940s, a California schoolteacher named John Reber wanted to change the whole San Francisco Bay Area. He was also a theater producer and taught himself engineering. Even though he wasn’t a professional, he suggested building two huge dams, creating big lakes for drinking water, and reclaiming 20,000 acres for development. People took him seriously, and newspapers supported his idea. Congress even held meetings to see if it could work. The Army Corps of Engineers even made a small model of the Bay to test it out. But they found some problems, so the plan never happened.\n\nToday, would anyone take such a big idea seriously? Back in the 1950s, people liked big plans and wondered if they could succeed. Now, if a schoolteacher suggests a grand idea, people might laugh it off, and even if someone powerful proposes a big vision, they might be seen as arrogant. You can still check out the Bay Model in Sausalito, but now it’s just a tourist spot: big future plans have become old-fashioned curiosities.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Over the years, each generation has built on the ideas of the past, creating amazing projects like tunnels, canals, and highways. However, while big plans were once welcomed, today they are often dismissed as unrealistic, even if they come from credible sources.",
