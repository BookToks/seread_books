  "simplified_text": "IS INDEFINITE OPTIMISM EVEN POSSIBLE?\n\nWhat kind of future will our overly positive choices create? If American families were saving money, they could look forward to spending it later. And if American companies were investing, they could expect to make more money in the future. But right now, U.S. families are saving almost nothing. And U.S. companies are just sitting on their cash without investing in new projects because they don’t have any clear plans for what’s next.\n\nThere are three other ways to think about the future. Definite optimism works when you actively create the future you want. Definite pessimism works by focusing on things that can be copied without expecting anything new to happen. Indefinite pessimism works because if you have low expectations, you’ll probably meet them. But indefinite optimism seems hard to maintain: how can the future get better if no one is planning for it?\n\nActually, most people today have heard an answer to this question: progress without planning is called “evolution.” Darwin said that life tends to “progress” without anyone trying to make it happen. Every living thing is just a random version of something else, and the best versions survive.\n\nDarwin’s ideas explain how creatures like trilobites and dinosaurs came to be, but can we use them to understand other areas? Just like Newton’s physics can’t explain black holes or the Big Bang, it’s not clear that Darwin’s biology can tell us how to create a better society or start a new business from scratch. Still, in recent years, people have started using Darwin’s ideas in business. Journalists compare survival in nature to survival in the business world, leading to headlines like “Digital Darwinism” and “Survival of the Clickiest.”\n\nEven in tech-heavy places like Silicon Valley, people are talking about creating a “lean startup” that can “adapt” and “evolve” to keep up with changes. New entrepreneurs are told that they can’t know everything in advance: they should listen to what customers want, create a simple version of their product, and improve it over time.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses the challenges of indefinite optimism in planning for the future. It contrasts this with definite optimism and pessimism, and explores how Darwin's ideas about evolution are often applied to business and startups today.",
