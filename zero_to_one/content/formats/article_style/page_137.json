  "simplified_text": "The path to living forever seems blocked. Maybe the only way to be a rock star forever is to die young. \n\nWe both admire and criticize tech founders just like we do with celebrities. Howard Hughes had the most dramatic story of any tech founder in the 20th century. He was born rich, but he cared more about engineering than living in luxury. At just 11 years old, he built Houston's first radio transmitter. The next year, he created the city's first motorcycle. By the time he was 30, he had made nine successful movies when Hollywood was just starting to change. But Hughes was even more famous for his work in aviation. He designed, built, and flew planes himself. He set world records for the fastest airspeed, the quickest flight across the country, and the fastest trip around the world.\n\nHughes was obsessed with flying higher than anyone else. He liked to remind people that he was just a regular guy, not a Greek god—something people say when they want to be compared to gods. His lawyer even argued in court that Hughes was different from normal people. Hughes paid him to say that, and the judge and jury agreed. When Hughes got the Congressional Gold Medal in 1939 for his achievements in aviation, he didn’t even show up to get it. Years later, President Truman found it in the White House and sent it to him.\n\nThings started to go downhill for Hughes in 1946 when he had his third and worst plane crash. If he had died then, people would have remembered him as one of the coolest and most successful Americans ever. But he survived—barely. After that, he became obsessed with little things, got addicted to painkillers, and isolated himself for the last 30 years of his life. He had always acted a bit strange, thinking that fewer people would bother him if he seemed crazy. But when his strange behavior turned into a real issue, he became someone people felt sorry for as much as they admired him.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Howard Hughes was a famous tech founder and aviator who went from being admired to pitied. After a serious plane crash, he struggled with mental health issues and isolated himself, changing how people viewed him from a hero to a tragic figure.",
