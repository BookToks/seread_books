By mid-2000, the leaders of the G7 countries had to step in and spend a lot of money to keep it from failing.\n\nAt the same time, there was a short period of excitement about internet companies that began in September 1998. This was happening in a world where everything else seemed to be struggling. The old ways of doing business couldn't keep up with the changes from globalization.
