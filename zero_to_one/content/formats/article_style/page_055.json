Nowadays, we often make the differences between left-liberal ideas and libertarian ideas seem bigger than they really are because most people share a vague attitude. In philosophy, politics, and business, arguing about how things should be done has become a way to keep putting off making real plans for a better future.\n\nIndefinite Life  \nA long time ago, people wanted to understand how to live longer. In the 1500s, explorers searched the jungles of Florida for a magical Fountain of Youth. Francis Bacon said that “the prolongation of life” should be its own area of medicine and the most important one. In the 1660s, Robert Boyle put life extension and “the Recovery of Youth” at the top of his wish list for future science. Whether through exploring new places or doing lab research, the smartest people of the Renaissance saw death as something to conquer. (Some who resisted died trying: Bacon caught pneumonia and died in 1626 while testing if freezing a chicken could make it live longer.)\n\nWe still don’t know all the secrets of life, but in the 1800s, insurance companies and statisticians figured out something about death that still affects us today: they learned how to turn it into a math problem. “Life tables” show us our chances of dying each year, which people in the past didn’t know. But in exchange for better insurance, it seems like we stopped searching for ways to live longer. Knowing how long people usually live has made that seem normal. Today, our society is filled with the ideas that death is both unavoidable and random.\n\nAt the same time, these ideas about probability have influenced biology itself. In 1928, a Scottish scientist named Alexander Fleming accidentally discovered penicillin when he found a strange antibacterial fungus growing on a petri dish he forgot to cover. Since then, scientists have tried to use chance to their advantage. Modern drug discovery aims to make the most of Fleming’s lucky find by testing random combinations of chemical compounds to find new medicines.\n\nBut it’s not working as well as it used to. Even with huge advances in the last two hundred years, biotechnology hasn’t met the hopes of investors or patients in recent years. Eroom’s law—Moore’s law backward—shows that the number of new drugs approved for every billion dollars spent on research and development has dropped by half every nine years since 1950. While technology has sped up during the same time, the big question for biotech now is whether it will ever catch up. When you compare biotech startups to software companies, the difference is clear.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how people have long sought to understand and extend life, from ancient explorers to modern scientists. It highlights how the understanding of death has changed and how biotechnology struggles to keep up with technological advancements.",
