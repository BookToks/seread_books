But that didn’t happen. \n\nSmartphones keep us glued to our screens and make us forget that the world around us hasn’t changed much. The only big improvements since the 1950s are in computers and communication. \n\nThis doesn’t mean our parents were wrong to dream of a better future; they just thought it would happen automatically.
