First, we should move away from old ideas in philosophy classes. People like John Rawls need to be replaced. Also, we should convince Malcolm Gladwell to rethink his ideas. And we need to push pollsters out of politics. \n\nBut changing the minds of professors and popular thinkers like Gladwell is tough. Our politicians are also stuck in their ways. Itâ€™s really hard to make changes in these crowded areas, even if we have smart ideas and good intentions. \n\nStarting a business is one of the biggest things you can control. You can have power not just over your own life, but also over a small but important part of the world. It starts by saying no to the unfairness of luck. Remember, you are not just a lottery ticket.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage talks about the need for a cultural change in the Western world to create a better future. It highlights the challenges of changing established ideas and emphasizes that starting a business gives you control over your life and the world around you.",
