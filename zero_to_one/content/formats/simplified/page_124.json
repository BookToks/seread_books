  "simplified_text": "TESLA: 7 FOR 7\n\nTesla is one of the few clean tech companies from the last decade that is still doing well today. They really understood how to ride the wave of interest in clean technology, but they also answered seven important questions that helped them succeed.\n\nTECHNOLOGY.  \nTesla's technology is so good that other car companies depend on it. For example, Daimler uses Tesla’s battery packs, Mercedes-Benz uses a Tesla powertrain, and Toyota uses a Tesla motor. General Motors even created a team to keep an eye on what Tesla does next. But Tesla's biggest tech win isn’t just one part; it’s how well they combine many parts into one amazing product. The Tesla Model S sedan looks great from every angle and is rated higher than any other car ever by Consumer Reports. Plus, both Motor Trend and Automobile magazines named it their 2013 Car of the Year.\n\nTIMING.  \nBack in 2009, many thought the government would keep supporting clean tech forever. “Green jobs” were a big deal, and there was money set aside for it. Congress even seemed likely to pass laws to help. But while others thought the money would keep coming, Tesla's CEO Elon Musk saw it as a one-time chance. In January 2010, before a big clean tech company called Solyndra failed, Tesla got a $465 million loan from the U.S. Department of Energy. Getting that much money was hard to imagine back then, and it still is today. Tesla took that chance at the perfect moment.\n\nMONOPOLY.  \nTesla started in a small area where they could be the best: high-end electric sports cars. Since the first Roadster came out in 2008, Tesla sold about 3,000 of them, but at $109,000 each, that’s a lot of money. Starting small let Tesla do the research needed to create the slightly cheaper Model S, and now they own the luxury electric sedan market too. They sold over 20,000 sedans in 2013 and are ready to grow into bigger markets in the future.\n\nTEAM.  \nTesla’s CEO is both a great engineer and a good salesman, so it makes sense that he has put together a team that excels in both areas. Elon describes his staff like this: “If you’re at Tesla, you’re choosing to be at the equivalent of Special Forces. There’s the regular army, and that’s fine, but if you are working at Tesla, you’re choosing to step up your game.”\n\nDISTRIBUTION.  \nMany companies don’t think distribution is important, but Tesla took it seriously and decided to control the whole distribution process. Other car companies, like Ford and Hyundai, make cars but rely on other people to sell them. Tesla sells and services its cars in its own stores. This approach costs more upfront than traditional dealerships, but it gives Tesla control over how customers experience their brand and saves them money in the long run.\n\nDURABILITY.  \nTesla has a head start and is moving faster than anyone else, and that combination gives them a big advantage.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Tesla is thriving by mastering technology, timing, and distribution. They started small in high-end electric cars and built a strong team. Their unique approach helps them control the customer experience and stay ahead of competitors.",
