  "simplified_text": "PARTY LIKE IT’S 1999\n\nOur tricky question—What important truth do very few people agree with you on?—is hard to answer directly. It might help to start with something everyone agrees on. Nietzsche once said, “Madness is rare in individuals—but in groups, parties, nations, and ages it is the rule.” This means that while one person might be sane, groups can act really crazy. If you can spot a popular belief that seems off, you might find a hidden truth behind it.\n\nLet’s think about something simple: companies are supposed to make money, not lose it. This should be obvious to anyone who thinks about it. But in the late 1990s, many people didn’t see it that way. Back then, people believed that losing money was okay if it meant they were investing in a better future. They thought page views on websites were more important than actual profits.\n\nPeople usually only realize that common beliefs are wrong after they fall apart. When this happens, we call it a bubble. But just because a bubble pops doesn’t mean the problems it caused go away. The internet craze of the ’90s was the biggest bubble since the crash of 1929, and what we learned from it still affects how we think about technology today. To think clearly, we need to question what we believe we know about the past.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how common beliefs can be misleading, especially in groups. It highlights the internet bubble of the late 1990s, showing that people often overlook the obvious truth that companies should make money. Understanding these past mistakes helps us think more clearly about technology today.",
