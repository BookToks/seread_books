  "simplified_text": "Materials, fun speeches, high prices, and even simple designs can all be copied. But these flashy tricks don’t mean much without something solid underneath. Apple has a bunch of special technologies, both in hardware (like better touchscreen materials) and software (like touchscreen designs made for those materials). They make products on such a large scale that they can control the prices of the materials they buy. Plus, they have a strong network effect from their content ecosystem: tons of developers create apps for Apple devices because there are hundreds of millions of users, and those users stick around because that’s where the apps are. These advantages are less obvious than Apple’s shiny brand, but they are the real reasons why Apple keeps its strong position in the market.\n\nStarting with a brand instead of real value can be risky. Ever since Marissa Mayer became CEO of Yahoo! in 2012, she has tried to bring back the once-popular company by making it trendy again. In one tweet, Yahoo! shared Mayer’s plan: “people then products then traffic then revenue.” The idea is that people will come for the trendiness: Yahoo! changed its logo to look better, bought cool startups like Tumblr, and got media attention because of Mayer’s fame. But the big question is what products Yahoo! will actually make. When Steve Jobs came back to Apple, he didn’t just make it a cool place to work; he cut down on product lines to focus on the few chances for major improvements. No tech company can survive on branding alone.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage explains how Apple’s strong technologies and network effects support its brand, while Yahoo! struggles to revive itself through trendiness without solid products. It emphasizes that real value is essential for success, not just a cool image.",
