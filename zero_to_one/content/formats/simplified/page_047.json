Malcolm Gladwell, a well-known author, says in his book *Outliers* that success comes from a mix of lucky breaks and random advantages. Warren Buffett calls himself a member of the \"lucky sperm club\" and jokes about winning the \"ovarian lottery.\" Jeff Bezos thinks Amazon's success is due to \"incredible planetary alignment,\" saying it's \"half luck, half good timing, and the rest brains.\" Bill Gates even claims he was lucky to have certain skills, though it’s unclear if that’s really true.\n\nMaybe these guys are just being humble on purpose. However, the idea of people starting many successful businesses makes us question if success is mostly about luck. Many people have built multiple multimillion-dollar companies. A few, like Steve Jobs, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk, have created several billion-dollar companies. If success was mostly luck, these serial entrepreneurs probably wouldn’t be around.\n\nIn January 2013, Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter and Square, tweeted to his 2 million followers: “Success is never accidental.” Most replies were negative. A reporter named Alexis Madrigal mentioned this tweet in *The Atlantic*, saying it sounded like something only rich, successful white men would say. It’s true that successful people have an easier time starting new things because of their connections, money, or experience. But maybe we’re too quick to dismiss those who say they succeeded on purpose.\n\nIs there a way to settle this debate for sure? Sadly, no, because companies aren’t like science experiments. To find a scientific answer about Facebook, for example, we’d have to go back to 2004, create 1,000 copies of the world, and start Facebook in each one to see how many times it would succeed. But that’s impossible. Every company starts in different situations and only once. Statistics don’t work when you only have one example.\n\nFrom the Renaissance to the mid-20th century, people believed luck was something you could control. Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “Shallow men believe in luck, believe in circumstances.… Strong men believe in cause and effect.” In 1912, Roald Amundsen, the first explorer to reach the South Pole, said, “Victory awaits him who has everything in order—luck, people call it.” People knew bad luck existed, but they believed in making their own luck through hard work.\n\nIf you think your life is mostly about chance, why read this book? Learning about startups is pointless if you’re just reading stories about people who got lucky. Books like *Slot Machines for Dummies* might tell you how to pick the right machine, but they can’t teach you how to win. Did Bill Gates just get lucky with his intelligence? Was Sheryl Sandberg born rich, or did she work hard? When we talk about past events, luck is in the past. What matters more is whether the future is about chance or planning.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The debate about whether success comes from luck or skill is ongoing. Successful people often attribute their achievements to a mix of both. However, many entrepreneurs have repeatedly succeeded, suggesting that hard work and planning also play a significant role in success.",
