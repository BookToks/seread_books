  "text": "The importance of making money in the future is surprising, even in places like Silicon Valley. For a company to be valuable, it needs to grow and last a long time. But many entrepreneurs only care about quick growth. They have a reason for this: it's easy to measure growth, but it's hard to measure how long a business will last. Those who get too caught up in numbers focus on things like how many people use their app each week, how much money they make each month, and how much they earn every three months. But even if they hit those targets, they might miss bigger problems that could hurt their business in the long run.\n\nFor instance, both Zynga and Groupon grew quickly, but that made them ignore important long-term issues. Zynga had early success with games like Farmville and claimed they could predict what games people would like. But they faced the same issue as Hollywood: how do you keep making popular games for people who change their minds all the time? (No one really knows.) Groupon grew fast because many local businesses tried their service. But getting those businesses to keep coming back was tougher than they expected.\n\nIf you only care about quick growth, you might forget to ask the most important question: will this business still be around in ten years? Just looking at numbers wonâ€™t give you the answer; you need to think carefully about what makes your business strong.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Companies often focus too much on quick growth instead of long-term success. This can lead to ignoring deeper issues that affect their future. It's crucial to think about whether a business will last, not just about hitting short-term numbers."
