  "simplified_text": "In your life, don’t waste time looking for secrets. It’s already tough to be alone while believing in something that others don’t. But being alone and wrong can feel even worse.\n\nNext is complacency. People in high positions have the most freedom to think outside the box, but they often don’t believe in secrets. Why bother searching for something new when you can just enjoy what’s already been done? Every year, top law schools and business schools tell new students, “You got into this elite school. You’re all set for life.” But that’s probably only true if you actually believe it.\n\nThe fourth point is about “flatness.” As the world becomes more connected, people see it as one big, competitive market: the world is “flat.” Because of this, anyone who might want to find a secret might think, “If there was something new to discover, wouldn’t someone smarter or more creative have found it already?” This doubt can stop people from even trying to look for secrets in a world that feels too big for anyone to make a unique contribution.\n\nThere’s a positive way to look at these trends: nowadays, it’s hard to start a cult. Forty years ago, people were more open to the idea that not all knowledge was known. Many believed they could join a special group that would teach them the truth. Today, very few people take strange ideas seriously, and most see this as progress. While it’s good that there are fewer weird cults now, we’ve lost our sense of wonder about the secrets still waiting to be discovered.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how people often avoid searching for secrets due to fear of being wrong, complacency, and a belief that everything has already been discovered. While fewer cults exist today, this has come at the cost of losing our curiosity about unknown knowledge.",
