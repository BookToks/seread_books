I learned this during my time at PayPal. Back in the year 2000, we had made it through the dot-com crash and were growing quickly, but we had a big problem: we were losing over $10 million each month to credit card fraud. Since we were processing hundreds or even thousands of transactions every minute, we couldn’t check each one—no team of people could work that fast.\n\nSo, we did what engineers do: we tried to automate a solution. First, Max Levchin put together a team of smart mathematicians to look closely at the fraud cases. Then we used what we learned to create software that could automatically find and cancel fake transactions right away. But we soon realized this wouldn’t work either: after a short time, the criminals would change their tricks. We were up against clever thieves, and our software couldn’t keep up.\n\nThe fraudsters’ tricks fooled our automatic detection systems, but our human analysts weren’t fooled as easily. So, Max and his team changed the software to use a mix of both: the computer would highlight the most suspicious transactions on a user-friendly screen, and human operators would decide if they were real or fake. Thanks to this combined system—we called it “Igor,” after a fraudster who claimed we’d never catch him—we made our first profit in early 2002, compared to a loss of $29.3 million the year before. The FBI even asked if they could use Igor to help find financial crime. Max could proudly say he was “the Sherlock Holmes of the Internet Underground.”\n\nThis teamwork between humans and machines helped PayPal stay alive, which allowed many small businesses to accept payments online. None of this would have happened without that human-computer solution, even if most people never knew about it.\n\nAfter we sold PayPal in 2002, I kept thinking: if humans and computers together could do so much better than either alone, what other businesses could we create using this idea? The next year, I pitched Alex Karp, a friend from Stanford, and Stephen Cohen, a software engineer, on a new startup idea: we would use the human-computer mix from PayPal’s security system to find terrorist networks and financial fraud. We already knew the FBI was interested, and in 2004, we started Palantir, a software company that helps people make sense of different types of information. By 2014, the company was expected to make $1 billion in sales, and Forbes called Palantir’s software the “killer app” for helping the government find Osama bin Laden.\n\nWe can’t share details about that operation, but we know that neither human intelligence nor computers alone can keep us safe. America’s two biggest spy agencies have different approaches: the CIA is run by spies who focus on humans, while the NSA is run by generals who focus on computers. CIA analysts have to sift through a lot of information, making it hard to spot serious threats. NSA computers can handle tons of data, but machines can’t decide if someone is planning a terrorist act. Palantir aims to combine both methods: its software looks at the data the government provides—like phone records of radical clerics or bank accounts linked to terror groups—and flags suspicious activities for trained analysts to check out.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage explains how combining human intelligence with computer technology helped PayPal fight credit card fraud and led to the creation of Palantir, a successful software company. This teamwork approach is essential for tackling complex problems like terrorism and financial crime.",
