  "text": "1. **Quick Summary**  \nThe text questions the distinction between major and minor problems, suggesting that all problems are interconnected. By deeply understanding any problem, such as anger or jealousy, we can uncover the root of all issues, which often stems from our self-image and personal ideals.\n\n2. **Explanation**  \nThe author challenges the common practice of categorizing problems as significant or trivial. He argues that every problem, regardless of size, reveals insights into our deeper issues. For example, anger often arises from feelings of hurt tied to our self-importance and the images we create about ourselves. When our self-image is threatened, we react with anger. However, by observing our true selves without judgment or fear, we can detach from these reactions. This awareness allows us to confront our actual state rather than live in the illusions we create about ourselves.\n\n3. **Apply It (Actionable Takeaways)**  \n- Reflect on a recent problem and analyze it deeply.  \n- Observe your reactions to criticism without judgment.  \n- Identify the self-image that triggers your emotional responses.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Understanding any problem deeply reveals the interconnectedness of all issues, as they stem from our self-image and reactions to reality."
