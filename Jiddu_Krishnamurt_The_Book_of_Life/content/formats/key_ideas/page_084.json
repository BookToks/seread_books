True awareness involves observing thoughts and feelings without judgment or the desire for a specific outcome, allowing them to unfold freely.\n\n2. **Explanation**  \nPracticing awareness can turn it into a tedious task, as it introduces effort and creates habits that distort genuine perception. Instead of merely observing the world around us, we must also recognize our inner conflicts without judgment. This means allowing thoughts and feelings to develop naturally, rather than trying to control or categorize them. When we observe without the urge to label experiences as right or wrong, we foster a deeper understanding. This kind of awareness allows thoughts to flourish, ultimately leading to a clearer perception of ourselves and our experiences, free from the constraints of judgment.\n\n3. **Apply It (Actionable Takeaways)**  \n- Observe your thoughts without judgment or labels.  \n- Allow your feelings to unfold naturally without trying to control them.  \n- Practice silent observation of your inner conflicts.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Awareness, when practiced as a habit, becomes tedious and painful, as it involves effort and distortion rather than the natural observation of thoughts and feelings."
