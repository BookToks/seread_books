  "text": "1. **Quick Summary**  \nThe mind can only be free when it stops creating new habits while breaking old ones. Seeking truth requires energy, and if not directed towards this pursuit, it can lead to destructive behavior. In this way, energy can create its own discipline, allowing individuals to act as responsible citizens without societal control.\n\n2. **Explanation**  \nA free mind is one that no longer generates new habits while trying to discard old ones; this cycle prevents true freedom. When individuals focus their energy on seeking truth or reality, they channel that energy constructively rather than destructively. This pursuit of truth fosters a natural discipline, meaning individuals can govern themselves without needing external rules. In contrast, when energy is wasted on conflicts and struggles, it leads to societal control and personal dissatisfaction. Thus, understanding how to harness energy for meaningful pursuits can lead to a more fulfilling life and a responsible existence within society.\n\n3. **Apply It (Actionable Takeaways)**  \n• Focus your energy on seeking truth.  \n• Avoid creating new habits while breaking old ones.  \n• Recognize and stop wasting energy on conflicts.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A free mind, liberated from conditioning and conflict, can perceive deeper truths and create its own discipline in the pursuit of reality."
