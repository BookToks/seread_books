  "text": "1. **Quick Summary**  \nLove is a state of being that transcends mental constructs and cannot be fully understood or defined by the mind. In relationships, particularly marriage, love is often replaced by adjustment and contract, leading to conflict rather than true connection. Without love, relationships become superficial and painful.\n\n2. **Explanation**  \nThe essence of love is not something the mind can grasp; it exists beyond definitions and labels. When we enter relationships, we often do so with expectations and mental frameworks, which can create barriers instead of fostering genuine connection. Marriage, when devoid of love, turns into a series of adjustments and compromises, leading to dissatisfaction and conflict. True love requires the absence of the self, allowing for a deeper bond that cannot be cultivated through mere effort or ideals. Without this authentic love, relationships become a source of pain rather than joy.\n\n3. **Apply It (Actionable Takeaways)**  \n• Reflect on your relationships to identify the presence of true love.  \n• Avoid viewing marriage as a contract; seek genuine connection instead.  \n• Let go of self-importance to foster deeper relationships.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** What we call love is a mental construct that often leads to conflict and adjustment rather than true connection."
