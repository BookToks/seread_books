  "text": "1. **Quick Summary**  \nLearning is a dynamic process that occurs in the present, not something that can be accumulated or stored as knowledge. Comparison and the desire for competition hinder true learning, leading to frustration and fear. Understanding oneself is essential for genuine learning and wisdom.\n\n2. **Explanation**  \nTrue learning is an ongoing experience that happens in the moment, rather than a collection of facts or knowledge from the past. When people compare themselves to others, it often results in feelings of envy and competition, which distract from the learning process. Instead of simply gathering information, real learning involves self-discovery and understanding. This means letting go of preconceived notions and past experiences to truly engage with the present. Only by doing so can one gain insight into oneself and the nature of existence, leading to genuine wisdom.\n\n3. **Apply It (Actionable Takeaways)**  \n• Focus on self-discovery instead of comparing yourself to others.  \n• Engage in present-moment awareness during learning activities.  \n• Let go of past knowledge to embrace new insights.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Learning is a continuous process that cannot be based on the accumulation of knowledge or past experiences."
