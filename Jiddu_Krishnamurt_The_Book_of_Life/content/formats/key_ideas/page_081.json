  "text": "1. **Quick Summary**  \nAttention is a broader and more expansive mental state than concentration. While concentration narrows focus and can limit understanding, attention allows for a limitless exploration of ideas and knowledge. True attention requires complete awareness without the distraction of self-imposed resistance.\n\n2. **Explanation**  \nAttention differs significantly from concentration. Concentration confines the mind to a specific point, creating boundaries that limit understanding. In contrast, attention is expansive and allows for a deeper grasp of the whole picture. When we concentrate, we often become preoccupied with our thoughts and judgments, which hinders our ability to truly observe and absorb what we encounter. To genuinely understand something, we must engage with it fully, without labeling or categorizing it, which often leads to distraction. Achieving this state of attention is challenging, as our minds are accustomed to distractions and the urge to control our focus.\n\n3. **Apply It (Actionable Takeaways)**  \n• Practice being fully aware of your surroundings.  \n• Avoid labeling or categorizing what you observe.  \n• Let go of resistance to distractions when focusing.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Attention is a limitless state of awareness that transcends the boundaries of concentration and knowledge."
