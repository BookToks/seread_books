When our actions are driven by beliefs or ideas, they become fragmented and ineffective. True action requires freedom from these limiting ideas.\n\n2. **Explanation**  \nThe text argues that ideas often hinder our ability to act effectively. When we rely on beliefs or concepts, our actions become disconnected and constrained. This separation prevents us from experiencing life fully and understanding truth in the moment.
