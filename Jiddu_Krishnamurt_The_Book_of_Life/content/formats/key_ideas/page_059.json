  "text": "1. **Quick Summary**  \nChastity cannot be achieved through mere self-denial or discipline; it requires love. When individuals pursue celibacy for personal gain, they miss the essence of true purity. Genuine love arises only when fear and habitual thinking are set aside.\n\n2. **Explanation**  \nChastity is often misunderstood as simply abstaining from sexual activity, but this approach can lead to unchaste feelings driven by fear and desire for results. True chastity emerges from a heart filled with love, not from repression or self-discipline. When we are burdened by fear and routine, we cannot truly experience love. Instead of trying to suppress passion or seeking it through renunciation, we should aim to understand and embrace it. Only by letting go of resistance and approaching passion with love can we find purity and connection. This understanding reveals that means and ends are interconnected; pursuing chastity without love is ultimately unfulfilling.\n\n3. **Apply It (Actionable Takeaways)**  \n- Reflect on your motivations for pursuing chastity.  \n- Let go of fear and habitual thoughts about passion.  \n- Cultivate love and compassion in your relationships.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Chastity arises from love, not from suppression or the pursuit of results."
