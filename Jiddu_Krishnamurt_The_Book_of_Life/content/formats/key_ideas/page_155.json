It argues that true compassion cannot be cultivated through external means or compulsion; instead, it arises when thought ceases entirely. The text emphasizes that genuine compassion is an active, present experience, not just a static concept.\n\n2. **Explanation**  \nCompassion is often misunderstood as a feeling or sentiment that can be developed through thought or moral teachings.

When we rely on thoughts, we risk becoming mechanical and detached from the richness of life. Real compassion is dynamic and alive, rooted in our immediate experience rather than past concepts. It cannot be forced or manufactured through rules or expectations; it arises naturally when we are free from the constraints of thought and ambition.\n\n3. **Apply It (Actionable Takeaways)**  \n- Reflect on moments when you felt true compassion.  \n- Practice being present and aware in your interactions.  \n- Let go of judgment and allow compassion to arise naturally.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A society plagued by inequality and corruption can only transform when individuals free themselves from ambition and truly understand love and compassion."
