Genuine insight requires a quiet mind, free from induced stillness, which is not true stillness. Religion, as commonly understood, is based on beliefs and dogmas, but real truth lies beyond these constructs.\n\n2. **Explanation**  \nWhen we pray or ask for help, we typically do so out of confusion or distress. This means our prayers reflect our desires rather than uncovering deeper truths. True understanding requires a mind that is genuinely calm, not one that is forced into stillness through repetition or discipline. Just as a child may appear quiet while actually feeling turmoil inside, our minds can seem still but remain restless. Moreover, traditional religion often consists of beliefs and rituals that may not lead to real insight. To discover what is true, we must move beyond these beliefs and cultivate personal strength and initiative, seeking truth for ourselves instead of relying on external constructs.\n\n3. **Apply It (Actionable Takeaways)**  \n• Quiet your mind without forced stillness.  \n• Explore your beliefs and question their validity.  \n• Seek truth through personal experience, not dogma.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Prayer and organized religion are seen as projections of the mind that do not lead to true understanding or reality."
