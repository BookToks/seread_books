  "text": "1. **Quick Summary**  \nLove is different from pleasure and cannot be driven by self-interest or expectations. Genuine love exists without motives, and feeling hurt when love isn’t returned indicates a lack of true love. Love is essential for a meaningful existence, while living without it leads to confusion and pain.\n\n2. **Explanation**  \nUnderstanding love requires recognizing that it should not be tied to personal gain or expectations. When we help others with the hope of receiving something in return, we are not truly loving; instead, we are acting out of fear and self-interest. Love is vital for a fulfilling life, as it brings depth and connection. In contrast, a life devoid of love leads to a mechanical existence filled with conflict and power struggles. Organizations and systems built solely on efficiency often perpetuate brutality and chaos. True order and peace can only arise from love, goodwill, and compassion, making love a powerful and necessary force in our lives.\n\n3. **Apply It (Actionable Takeaways)**  \n• Reflect on your motivations in relationships.  \n• Practice giving without expecting anything in return.  \n• Cultivate love and compassion in daily interactions.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Love is fundamentally different from pleasure and cannot exist with motives or expectations."
