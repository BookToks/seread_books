  "text": "1. **Quick Summary**  \nThe text explores the idea that attempting to change one's crude or stupid nature can be counterproductive. Instead of striving to become sensitive or intelligent, one should observe and understand their own flaws, as this awareness can lead to genuine transformation.\n\n2. **Explanation**  \nThe passage emphasizes that trying to force change often results in a deeper entrenchment in one's current state. For instance, if you recognize your mind as crude and strive to be sensitive, that very effort can be a form of crudity. Instead, by observing your behaviors—like how you treat others or your daily habits—you can gain insights into your crudeness or stupidity. This process of self-observation is crucial; it allows you to understand these traits without the distraction of wanting to change them immediately. Through this awareness, real transformation can occur, enabling a deeper understanding of oneself and fostering growth.\n\n3. **Apply It (Actionable Takeaways)**  \n- Observe your daily behaviors without the intent to change.  \n- Reflect on how you treat others to understand your flaws.  \n- Acknowledge your current state without striving for immediate improvement.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The crude mind cannot become sensitive through effort, but rather through understanding and observing its own nature."
