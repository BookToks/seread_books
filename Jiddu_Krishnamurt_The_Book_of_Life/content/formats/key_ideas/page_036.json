  "text": "1. **Quick Summary**  \nGoodness is not simply the opposite of evil; it exists in a state of total attention without motive. The mind often confuses attention with desire, which distracts from true goodness. Additionally, the idea of psychological evolution from evil to good is flawed, as the core of the self remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Explanation**  \nThe text emphasizes that goodness is distinct from evil and cannot arise from selfish motives. True goodness requires complete attention, which is free from desires or distractions. When we focus on acquiring something, even if it seems positive, we lose genuine attention. Furthermore, the belief that we can evolve from a flawed self to a perfect one is misguided. The “me” is a collection of memories and experiences that cannot transform into something noble through time. Instead, it remains rooted in its nature, suggesting that true change requires a deeper understanding beyond mere evolution.\n\n3. **Apply It (Actionable Takeaways)**  \n- Cultivate total attention in daily activities.  \n- Reflect on your motives before seeking goodness.  \n- Challenge the belief in psychological evolution of the self.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Goodness is a state of total attention without motive, distinct from the duality of good and evil."
