  "text": "1. **Quick Summary**  \nHappiness cannot be pursued or found through external means like possessions or relationships. Instead, it is a by-product of deeper experiences and self-awareness. Seeking happiness directly often leads to disappointment and conflict.\n\n2. **Explanation**  \nHappiness is not something you can chase after or acquire through material possessions, relationships, or thoughts. When you actively seek happiness, it tends to slip away, as true happiness arises naturally from within. The act of being aware of your happiness can actually diminish it, as awareness often comes with conflict and memory. Instead of focusing on the pursuit of happiness through external factors, which are temporary and often lead to dissatisfaction, we should look inward for genuine experiences that foster happiness. Recognizing that happiness is not a tangible goal but a state of being can help shift our perspective.\n\n3. **Apply It (Actionable Takeaways)**  \n• Reflect on moments of happiness without seeking them.  \n• Focus on inner experiences rather than external possessions.  \n• Acknowledge the impermanence of things to reduce attachment.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Happiness cannot be pursued or found through external means, as it is a by-product of self-awareness and cannot exist alongside conflict or memory."
