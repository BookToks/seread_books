  "text": "The mind is basically a collection of words and concepts. But can it break free from the word “envy”? Try it out. Words like God, truth, hate, and envy really shape how we think. If the mind isn’t free from these words, it can’t truly confront envy. When you look directly at what you call “envy,” that raw fact moves faster than any mental gymnastics you try to perform around it. If you’re just focused on getting rid of envy through some ideal of non-envy, you’re missing the point. The word “envy” can distract you from the reality of what you’re feeling. Recognizing feelings through words just keeps those feelings alive.\n\nSo, can the mind achieve that extraordinary clarity? This clarity doesn’t come from the outside or through searching. It happens when you stumble upon it without trying. When this happens, there’s no effort, no seeking, and no need for past experiences to keep you alert. \n\nWhen you ask yourself questions, you often do it verbally. That’s normal for most people. But remember: the word isn’t the thing itself. Just like the word “tree” isn’t the actual tree. The real experience comes when you touch it, not when you label it. Then it becomes real, and the word loses its power to control you. Take the word “God,” for example. It’s so charged that people get trapped in their beliefs, acting like a squirrel in a cage. You have to set aside the word and its symbols.\n\nThe way we use words has been built over centuries, shaping how individuals relate to society. To communicate, I need words, and you need to understand them too. This verbal framework has developed through ages. But can we wipe it away instantly? Can we escape this verbal prison that’s taken so long to build? You might think it requires time, and that’s okay, but that means you’re still caught in the cycle of what’s been. What if it could break free right now?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The mind's attachment to words like \"envy\" distracts from facing the actual feelings and facts, hindering true understanding and perception."
