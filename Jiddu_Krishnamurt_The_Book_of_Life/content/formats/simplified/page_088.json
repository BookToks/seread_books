  "text": "So, all these factors contribute to the violence that’s rampant in the world. Anyone who’s paying even a little attention can see what's happening, especially in this unfortunate country. You can find those same issues—brutality, callousness, indifference, violence—within yourself. \n\n**June 28**  \n**We Are Violent**\n\nWe all get that stopping violence is crucial. But how do I, as an individual, truly free myself from violence—not just on the surface, but deep down? If the idea of nonviolence can’t clear my mind of violence, will digging into its causes actually help? \n\nThis is a big deal, right? The whole world is tangled up in violence and wars; our society is built on greed, which is inherently violent. If we want to be free from violence—totally free, not just pretending—how do we do that without becoming self-focused? \n\nDo you see the issue? If I’m fixated on freeing my mind from violence and I try to discipline myself to switch from violence to nonviolence, I’m just making it about me. My focus is on getting rid of one thing and grabbing onto another. Yet, I know the mind needs to be completely free from violence. So, what’s the solution? It’s not just about asking, “How do I stop being violent?” That only creates an ideal, which feels pointless. But if I can look at violence and really understand it, maybe there’s a chance to resolve it for good.\n\n**June 29**  \n**To Destroy Hate**\n\nRight now, we’re seeing the world of hate reaping what it has sown. This hate didn’t just pop up; it’s been created by our ancestors and us. Ignorance stretches way back into history. It’s a product of human ignorance, right? We’ve all played a part in this cycle of hate, fear, and greed. As long as we indulge in hate, we’re part of that world. \n\nThe world is basically a reflection of you. If you want to eliminate hate, you have to stop hating yourself. To truly destroy hate, you need to break away from it in all its forms. As long as you’re stuck in it, you’re just contributing to that world of ignorance and fear. The world doesn’t exist separately from you; it’s a mirror of you multiplied.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Violence in the world is a reflection of individual human nature, and true freedom from it requires deep understanding rather than superficial ideals."
