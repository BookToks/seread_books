  "text": "When someone’s mind is packed with info and knowledge, it’s tough for them to experience anything new. They struggle to let go of what they’ve learned. If the mind can drop all that baggage—no Buddhas, no Christs, no teachers, no religions—it can become completely alone and untainted. That’s when real change can happen. A truly religious person doesn’t belong to any religion, nation, or race. They’re inwardly alone, in a space of not knowing, and that’s when the sacred starts to emerge. ✨\n\n---\n\nSaying “I don’t know” shows real humility. It means you’re not trying to flex your knowledge or impress anyone. Very few people can actually say it. When you do, fear fades away. You stop digging into what you already know. If you’re really getting this, you’ll see that when you say “I don’t know,” all your conditioning halts. So, what happens to your mind then?\n\nWe’re all chasing something lasting—something that doesn’t fade away. Everything around us is temporary, always changing, being born, dying, and we want to find something that lasts in this ever-changing world. But the truly sacred is beyond time; it’s not in what we already know. The known is just our thoughts reacting to memories. If I want to stop thinking, I need to understand how my thoughts work. Every thought, whether high-minded or totally dumb, comes from memory. Once I see that clearly, my mind can face a big problem and say, “I don’t know,” because it doesn’t have an answer. \n\n---\n\nBeing a theist or an atheist? Honestly, it’s kind of silly. If you really understood what truth or God is, you wouldn’t need to pick a side—belief wouldn’t matter. It’s the people who aren’t aware, who just hope or guess, that cling to beliefs to guide their actions. \n\nIf you approach this differently, you’ll discover something real that goes beyond all those limiting beliefs and the illusions they create. 🌌\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** True understanding and spiritual awakening require letting go of accumulated knowledge and beliefs, embracing a state of humility and not-knowing."
