  "text": "To end sorrow, you need to face death while you're still alive. This means letting go of your name, your stuff, your beliefs. When you do this, you become fresh and clear, able to see things as they really are. That’s what happens when you die. We know our bodies will eventually stop working. But instead of accepting this, we create a life filled with daily struggles and numbness, clinging to the idea of a “soul” that we think is sacred. But that’s just your thoughts—it’s still all about you.\n\nSo, live each day like you’re dying. This way, you connect with life more deeply. \n\nIn death, there’s renewal. It’s only through endings that new beginnings happen. I’m not here to comfort you; this isn’t about beliefs or theories. If you try to intellectualize it, you’ll just turn it into another comfort, like believing in reincarnation. The truth is, what continues doesn’t really experience rebirth or renewal. \n\nBy dying to your old self every day, you find immortality. This isn’t the death you fear, but the death of your old thoughts and experiences that define you. In letting go of the ‘me’ each moment, you tap into eternity and immortality. This is something to experience, not just talk about like reincarnation.\n\nWhen you stop being afraid, you realize every moment brings an ending and a chance to start fresh. Reality is the unknown, and so is death. It’s not beautiful to say we’ll just continue in some afterlife—that’s nonsense. The real deal is seeing death for what it is: an ending that leads to renewal, not just a continuation. What continues eventually decays, while what can renew itself is eternal.\n\nYou want reassurance that you’ll live again, but that won’t bring you happiness or wisdom. Seeking immortality through reincarnation is really just a selfish desire to keep protecting your ego. This craving leads to illusions. What matters is finding fulfillment right now. You can only do this when you stop shielding yourself from life. Your mind is clever at self-defense, and you need to see how that protection is an illusion. This means you have to think and act in completely new ways. You need to break free.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To end sorrow and experience renewal, one must die to their attachments and preconceived notions, embracing the unknown and the reality of life and death."
