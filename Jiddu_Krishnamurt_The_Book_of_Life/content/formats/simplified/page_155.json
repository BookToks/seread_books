  "text": "What kind of world do we live in when parents don’t share stories about the beauty of nature and the universe? It’s wild to think about a society where some people are super rich and have everything they want, while others struggle to get by. How did we end up here? You might try to change things, but breaking the old patterns just creates new ones that often look the same—think of the powerful elites with their fancy houses and privileges after revolutions like in France, Russia, and China. \n\nCan we really build a society without all this corruption and pain? It starts with us as individuals. We have to break free from the crowd, ditch the ambition, and truly understand what love means. That realization hit me hard.\n\nNow, let’s talk about compassion. It can’t be forced or thought into existence. I’m not talking about the opposite of hate or violence here. If we don’t develop a real sense of compassion, we risk becoming more brutal and inhuman. We’ll end up like machines, focused only on security and missing out on the beauty and depth of life.\n\nCompassion isn’t something you can just acquire. It’s not just a word from the past; it’s about taking action in the present. There’s a big difference between saying the word and actually living it. The word is static, while the action is alive and dynamic. You can give life to a word, but it’s not the same as the action itself.\n\nCompassion isn’t about being nice or polite. It can’t be cultivated through thought, discipline, or control. True compassion arises when we let go of thought entirely.\n\nCan we force compassion or goodness? If there’s any kind of pressure—like propaganda or moralizing—compassion won’t exist. Change can’t come from just needing to adapt to technology; it must happen without any strings attached.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A society plagued by inequality and corruption can only transform when individuals free themselves from ambition and truly understand love and compassion."
