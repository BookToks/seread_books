  "text": "Most people think learning happens through comparison, but that's not true. Comparison just leads to frustration and envy—basically, competition. It blocks real learning and creates fear. 😟\n\nLearning isn't about stacking up knowledge; it's a process that keeps moving. Learning and acquiring knowledge are different. Learning is ongoing, not just adding to what you know. We often collect knowledge as memories or ideas, then act based on that. But acting from accumulated knowledge—like tech skills or traditions—doesn't mean you're really learning. \n\nLearning is always fresh. You can't just store it up and act later. You learn as you go, so there’s no going backward or losing ground. \n\nWisdom? That’s something you find for yourself. It doesn’t come from just having knowledge. Knowledge and wisdom aren’t the same. Wisdom grows from truly knowing yourself. Without that self-awareness, you can’t create order in your life, and virtue is out of reach.\n\nLearning about yourself is not the same as just piling up knowledge about yourself. If you're just collecting info, you're not really learning. You're stuck in knowing and acquiring instead of truly understanding. \n\nReal learning happens in the present; it doesn’t have a past. The moment you say, “I’ve learned,” it turns into knowledge. From there, you can only accumulate more, not learn further. Only a mind that focuses on learning—not just acquiring—can grasp the whole idea of “me” or the self. To understand myself, I need to explore my structure and significance without the weight of past knowledge or experiences clouding my view. 🌟\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Learning is a continuous process that cannot be based on the accumulation of knowledge or past experiences."
