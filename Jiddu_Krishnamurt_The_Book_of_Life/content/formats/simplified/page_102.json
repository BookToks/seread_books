You need to look with genuine interest and openness. When you do, suffering and pain fade away. If I see suffering as something outside of me—like losing my brother or being broke—then I create a problem. But if I recognize that I am part of that suffering, everything changes. It transforms completely. With this new perspective, I can focus fully, and what I truly observe gets understood and resolved. Fear disappears, and suddenly, sorrow isn’t a thing anymore.  \n\n**July 28  \nThe Center of Suffering**\n\nEver been stunned by something beautiful—a mountain, a sunset, or a gorgeous smile? That moment silences you, right? You feel connected to the world. But I’m talking about a different kind of observation—one that isn’t influenced by past conditioning. To someone in sorrow, I say: sorrow is unavoidable; it comes from wanting fulfillment. When explanations stop, you can really look at suffering. If you’re observing from a fixed point—like a belief or a feeling—you limit your perspective. Holding onto something tightly causes strain and pain. When I view suffering from a fixed center, I feel it deeply. The inability to truly observe creates pain. If I’m focused on “I must escape pain” or “I need to understand why I suffer,” my view is narrow, and that leads to more sorrow.  \n\n**July 29  \nAn Immensity Beyond All Measure**\n\nWhen you lose someone to death, the first reaction is shock, then comes sorrow. What does sorrow even mean? It’s the loss of companionship, shared moments, and future plans—all gone in an instant, leaving you feeling empty and alone. That’s what you resist: being left with nothing, feeling completely isolated. The key is to sit with that emptiness. Just live with it—no reactions, no rationalizing, and definitely no running away to theories like reincarnation or other distractions. Embrace that emptiness fully.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sorrow arises from our relationship with suffering, which transforms when we fully observe and accept it without attachment."
