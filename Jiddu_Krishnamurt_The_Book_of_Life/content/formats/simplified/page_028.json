  "text": "What do I mean by the self? It’s the idea, the memories, the conclusions, and experiences we have. It’s all the intentions we can name or can’t name, the effort to exist or not, and the collective memory of everyone around us—racial, group, individual, clan, and beyond. This self shows up in our actions and our spiritual pursuits. It’s all about striving and competing. But here’s the kicker: when we face it, we see it can be pretty harmful. I use the word \"evil\" on purpose because the self divides and encloses us. Even when we do good things, they often feel isolated. We know this deep down. The real magic happens in those rare moments when the self fades away, and love takes over.\n\nWhen love is present, the self disappears. \n\nTruth isn’t something to just recognize. For real truth to emerge, we need to let go of beliefs, knowledge, experiences, and the chase for virtue (which is different from actually being virtuous). A person focused on being virtuous can’t grasp reality. They might be decent, but that’s not the same as understanding truth. The person who knows truth has it revealed to them. A virtuous person is just reinforcing their own self. For example, when they say, “I need to be free of greed,” even that state of being non-greedy ends up strengthening the self. \n\nThat’s why it’s crucial to be poor—not just in material things but in beliefs and knowledge too. Someone who is rich in worldly possessions or knowledge will only find darkness, leading to chaos and suffering. But if we can see how the self operates, we’ll understand what love truly is. That’s the only change that can transform the world. Love isn’t the self, and the self can’t recognize love. You might say, “I love,” but in that very moment, love isn’t there. When you truly know love, the self vanishes.\n\nA person who understands life doesn’t cling to beliefs. When you love, you just love. It’s the overthinking, intellectual types who hold onto beliefs because they crave security and want to avoid risks. They build up ideas to hide behind. If you faced violence directly, you’d seem like a threat to society. So the mind thinks, “I’ll aim for nonviolence in ten years,” but that’s just a false, made-up timeline. \n\nUnderstanding reality is way more important than chasing ideals because those ideals are often misleading. What is real takes a lot of insight and an open mind. Our reluctance to confront reality leads us to create countless escape routes.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The self, characterized by memory, intention, and separation, obstructs the experience of love and truth, which can only be realized when the self is absent."
