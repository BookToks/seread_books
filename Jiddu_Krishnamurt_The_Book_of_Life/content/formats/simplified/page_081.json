  "text": "Attention is limitless, no boundaries 🚀\n\nWhen we think about our minds, we should focus on attention, not just concentration. Concentration forces your mind to zero in on one thing, while attention is open and expansive. Concentration puts up walls, limiting your understanding. But when you aim to grasp the whole picture of your mind, just concentrating can actually get in the way. \n\nAttention has no limits, unlike knowledge, which comes from concentration. Knowledge is a collection of facts, but it’s still stuck within its own boundaries. In a state of attention, your mind can use knowledge, but remember: individual pieces (facts) don’t equal the whole picture. Just stacking up knowledge won’t help you understand the bigger, immeasurable concepts. The totality of understanding isn’t found in a concentrated mind.\n\nSo, attention is key, but you can't force it with concentration. Attention is a state where your mind is always learning, without clinging to past knowledge like a badge. When your mind focuses only on itself, it uses knowledge to boost its own ego, which can lead to contradictions and isolation. \n\nWhat is attention, anyway? If you’re pushing yourself to focus, like saying, “I have to pay attention and ignore everything else,” is that really attention? Nope! That’s resistance. When your mind fights to focus, it’s just blocking out other thoughts, which prevents true attention.\n\nTo really understand something, you need to give it your full attention. But that’s tough! Your mind loves to wander. You might think, “I know I should pay attention, but how?” That thought alone shows you’re still caught up in wanting something, so you won't truly focus.\n\nFor example, when you see a tree or a bird, if you label it—“That’s an oak” or “That’s a parrot”—you stop paying real attention. But if you look at it with total awareness, something amazing happens: you experience true transformation. Total attention is the real deal. You can’t just practice your way to it. Practice builds walls of resistance, and behind those walls is just concentration, not real attention. It’s about exclusion, not inclusion.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Attention is a limitless state of awareness that transcends the boundaries of concentration and knowledge."
