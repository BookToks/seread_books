  "text": "the present moment shapes our identity—the “me” and “mine,” the “I.” The self is where all fear starts.\n\n---\n\n**April**\n\n**April 1**  \n**Craving is all there is**  \n\nThere’s no separate being apart from craving; craving is everything. It wears different masks based on what it wants. When these changing desires clash with new experiences, we create a “chooser”—an identity that feels distinct from craving. But this identity isn’t separate from what it desires. The person trying to escape feelings of emptiness, loneliness, or incompleteness is actually one with those feelings. You can't run from yourself; you can only understand yourself. When you realize you are your own loneliness, that’s when you can break free from fear. Fear only exists in relation to ideas, and ideas come from memories. Thoughts stem from past experiences, but while they can think about emptiness, they can’t truly grasp it. The word “loneliness” carries memories of pain and fear, blocking fresh experiences. When that word loses its weight, the connection between you and your feelings changes completely. Then, you become the experience itself, which is the only way to find true freedom from fear.\n\n---\n\n**April 2**  \n**Understanding desire**  \n\nWe need to get a grip on desire, but it’s tough because it’s so intense and urgent. Fulfilling desire brings both passion and pain. To really understand desire, we have to drop all judgment. You can’t label desire as good or bad, or say, “I’ll keep this one and ditch that one.” To uncover the truth about desire—its beauty, its ugliness—we have to set aside those judgments.\n\n---\n\n**April 3**  \n**Desire needs understanding**  \n\nLet’s dive deeper into desire. We know it can be contradictory and torturous, pulling us in different directions. There’s pain, turmoil, and anxiety tied to desire, along with the need to control and discipline it. In this endless struggle, we twist ourselves up.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The self, rooted in craving, is the source of all fear and conflict, and true freedom comes from understanding rather than escaping one's desires and loneliness."
