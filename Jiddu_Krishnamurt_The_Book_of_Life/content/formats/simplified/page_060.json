  "text": "Becoming powerful—like crushing it as a lawyer or politician—doesn’t really change the game. That’s not true chastity; it’s just chasing a dream and resisting a desire. When love is present, chastity isn’t even an issue. Life becomes about living fully in love, and that’s how we create a new world. 🌍\n\n**Total Abandonment**  \nHave you ever felt that total freedom where you just let everything go? You can’t do that without deep passion. It’s not just a mental or emotional thing; it’s about feeling intensely. If you’re not passionate, you can’t truly appreciate beauty. A mind that clings to power or status—yikes—can never really let go.\n\n**This Pure Flame of Passion**  \nMost of us lack real passion. We might feel lust or a desire to escape, which gives us some intensity. But to really grasp sorrow, we need to tap into this passion without a specific cause. True understanding comes from being fully engaged. When passion leads to conflict, that pure flame can’t exist. We need that flame to completely eliminate sorrow.\n\n**Beauty Beyond Feeling**  \nWithout passion, can there even be beauty? I’m not talking about pretty pictures or fancy buildings. Those have their own kind of beauty. But there’s a deeper beauty that you can’t grasp without passion. Don’t get it twisted; passion isn’t a dirty word or something you can buy. It’s a powerful force that burns away what’s false. We often fear letting it burn away what we think is important. 🔥\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Chastity becomes irrelevant in the presence of love, which allows for total abandonment and the awakening of pure passion necessary to understand beauty and end sorrow."
