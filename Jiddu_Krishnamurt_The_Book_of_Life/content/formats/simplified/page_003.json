  "text": "**January 7**  \n**Listening to Yourself**  \n\n**Questioner:** When I’m here listening to you, I get it. But once I leave, it all slips away, even when I try to apply what you’ve said.  \n\n**Krishnamurti:** You’re actually just listening to yourself, not to me. If you’re focused on me, I become your guide, and that’s a problem. It sets up a power dynamic that’s not healthy. So, what’s happening is that you’re seeing your own reflection in what I say, not mine. If you realize you’re just observing yourself, you might think, “Okay, I see who I am, and I’m okay with it.” And that’s fine. But if you think, “I see who I am, and I need to change,” then you start to figure things out on your own, which is way different from just repeating what I say. When you really listen to yourself while I’m speaking, you gain clarity and sensitivity. Your mind becomes sharp and alive—not just obeying or resisting. That’s the kind of person who can help create a better world.  \n\n**January 8**  \n**Look with Intensity**  \n\nLearning is tough, and so is listening. We rarely listen because our minds are cluttered with what we already know. This makes real listening super hard. If you can listen fully—with energy and passion—that’s where real freedom comes in. But most of the time, we don’t listen because we haven’t learned how. You only truly learn when you commit yourself to something. Like with math: if you’re all in, you get it. But if you’re just forced to learn, it’s just about stacking up information. Learning is like reading a novel filled with characters; it needs your full attention, not a distracted one. If you want to understand a leaf—whether it’s from spring or summer—you need to really look at it. Notice its shape, texture, and life. There’s beauty and energy in just one leaf. So, to learn about a leaf, a flower, a cloud, a sunset, or a person, you have to look intensely.  \n\n**January 9**  \n**To Learn, the Mind Must Be Quiet**  \n\nTo discover something new, you have to start fresh—clear your mind, especially of knowledge. It’s easy to have experiences based on what you already know, but those are just projections of yourself, and they’re not real. If you want to find out what’s true for you, you need to strip away all that old stuff.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Listening requires quietness and full attention to truly understand oneself and the world."
