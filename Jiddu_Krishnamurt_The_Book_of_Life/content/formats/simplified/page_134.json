It's this kind of awareness that ends sorrow. ðŸŒŸ\n\nThe active still mind\n\nA truly still mind is surprisingly active, alive, and powerfulâ€”but not focused on anything specific. This mind is verbally freeâ€”free from past experiences and knowledge. It can see whatâ€™s true and has direct perception beyond time.\n\nA mind can only find silence when it understands the concept of time, which takes awareness, right? This mind must be freeâ€”not just free from something, but free in itself. We usually think of freedom as being free from something. But thatâ€™s just a reaction, not real freedom. A mind searching for freedom is never truly free. True freedom comes when the mind understands facts as they areâ€”without translation, judgment, or condemnation. When itâ€™s free like this, itâ€™s innocent, no matter how many days or years it has lived. Itâ€™s innocent because itâ€™s free in itself. Only such a mind can perceive whatâ€™s true, beyond time.\n\nOut of perception comes energy\n\nThe challenge is to fully free the mind so it reaches a state of awareness without borders. But how does the mind find that freedom?\n\nI hope youâ€™re seriously asking yourselves this because Iâ€™m not trying to influence you. Itâ€™s crucial to ask yourself this question urgently. The space for freedom is shrinking every day, as you probably notice. Politicians, leaders, priests, the media, and the beliefs you holdâ€”these all narrow your freedom. If you see this happening, if you truly perceive the constriction of spirit and the rising slavery of the mind, youâ€™ll discover that from perception comes energy. This energy, born from true perception, can break apart the petty mind, the respectable mind, the fearful mind. So, perception is the path to truth. âœ¨\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Immediate perception and choiceless awareness can free the mind from sorrow and lead to true understanding."
