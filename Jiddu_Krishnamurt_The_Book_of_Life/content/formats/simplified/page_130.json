  "text": "**Social order.** We’re part of society; we can’t escape it. When a person is in order, that creates order in society too. \n\n**A timeless state.** \n\nWhen we talk about time, we’re not just talking about clock time. That kind of time is necessary. If you want to catch a bus or be on time for an appointment, you need it. But what about psychological time? Is there really a tomorrow in our minds? Or do we just create “tomorrow” because we can’t see change happening right away? \n\nI realize I need to change my life, my thoughts, my feelings, and my actions. I tell myself, “I’ll take my time; I’ll be different tomorrow or in a month.” That’s the psychological time we’re discussing—this idea of tomorrow or the future. Time isn’t just about clocks; it’s about the past, present, and future. \n\nYesterday affects today and shapes tomorrow. It’s straightforward: I had an experience a year ago that stuck with me, and now I view the present through that lens of past experiences, knowledge, and conditioning. This creates my future. I’m stuck in this cycle. This is what we call living; this is our concept of time.\n\nThought—everything that makes you, you—along with all your memories, conditioning, hopes, and fears, that’s what time is. To grasp a timeless state, we need to explore if the mind can be completely free from all experiences tied to time.\n\n**The very nature of thought.** \n\nTime is thought, and thought is all about memory, which creates our sense of time—yesterday, today, and tomorrow. We use time to achieve things and navigate life. It’s crucial to us, like a cycle of lives that evolve from one to the next. Time is the essence of thought; they’re inseparable. As long as time is a tool for achieving something, the mind can’t go beyond itself. \n\nGoing beyond is what a new, timeless mind can do. Time is linked to fear. I’m not talking about the ticking clock, but the psychological process of time. This is what feeds our fears. Time creates frustration and conflict because seeing things as they are is timeless.\n\nTo really understand fear, you have to recognize time—not just as a measure but as a space that thought creates, stretching from yesterday to tomorrow. For most of us, fear is a heavy reality. A mind tangled in fear is caught in this complex web.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Understanding the psychological nature of time is essential to grasping the relationship between thought, fear, and the possibility of a timeless state."
