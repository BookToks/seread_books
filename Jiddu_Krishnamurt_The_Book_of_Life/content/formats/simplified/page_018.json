  "text": "Belief comes with a bunch of rituals and compulsions that both connect and divide us. We start asking what’s true and what all this struggle and pain means, but then we get tangled up in beliefs, rituals, and theories.\n\nBelief is a form of corruption. Behind every belief and moral code is the mind—the self—growing bigger and stronger. We often think that believing in God or something is what makes us religious. If you don’t believe, people label you an atheist and judge you for it. Some societies condemn believers, while others condemn non-believers. It’s all the same cycle. So, religion boils down to belief, and that belief messes with our minds, keeping us from true freedom. Only in freedom can we discover what’s true or what God really is—not through belief, since beliefs just reflect what we think God or truth should be.\n\nWhen you believe in God and someone else doesn’t, those beliefs create a divide. Beliefs are organized into religions like Hinduism, Buddhism, or Christianity, which further separate us. We often think belief will clear up our confusion, but it just adds another layer on top of it. Belief is a way to escape confusion instead of confronting it. To truly understand confusion, we don’t need belief; it just acts as a barrier between us and our problems. Organized religion becomes a way to avoid facing reality. \n\nThink about it: people who believe in God, do rituals, or chant may still be dominating, cruel, or dishonest in their daily lives. Can they really find God this way? Is God just about repeating words or holding beliefs? These people worship and go to temples, but they’re often avoiding the reality of who they are—and you might see them as respectable because they reflect parts of yourself.\n\nOne thing we all seem to accept without question is beliefs. I’m not here to bash beliefs; I want us to explore why we accept them. If we can figure out the reasons behind our acceptance, we might understand it better and even free ourselves from it. Political, religious, and national beliefs create conflict and confusion, driving us apart and sparking antagonism.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Belief acts as a screen that separates individuals and perpetuates confusion, preventing true understanding and freedom."
