  "text": "We’re diving into something important here. This isn’t about whether you agree or disagree. We’re examining life straight-up—no fluff, no bias. Our likes and dislikes are what lead to our misery. The big question is: \"How do we end fear?\" This is a major issue. If we can’t tackle fear, we’re stuck in darkness—not in some spiritual way, but in the everyday sense. One life is enough. There has to be a way out, but not by dreaming about a better future. Can we actually end fear completely, not just in bits and pieces? \n\nYou might not have asked yourself this question before, and that’s okay. Maybe you didn’t know how to escape it. But if you seriously consider this question—not how to get rid of fear, but what fear really is—then you’ll find that fear can just fade away. You won’t have to force it. \n\nWhen you really notice fear and face it directly, the observer and the observed become one. There’s no separation. When fear is seen without the observer, there’s action, but it’s not the observer acting on fear. \n\nNow, think about anything you observe—a tree, your partner, your kids, the stars, or a bird. There’s always the observer (the thinker) and the thing being observed. This creates a split. That split is what creates time, and time is where conflict lives. Conflict leads to contradictions. If there’s an observer and something observed, that’s a contradiction. Where there’s contradiction, there’s conflict. And when there’s conflict, there’s always a push to escape it, to conquer it, to do something about it—all of this takes time. As long as this division exists, time continues, and time equals sorrow. \n\nTo truly understand how to end sorrow, you need to grasp this: you must look beyond the split between the thinker and the thought, the experiencer and the experience. When there’s a division, there’s time, and no way to end sorrow. So, what do we do? You get that, right? I see that the observer in me is constantly judging, censoring, accepting, rejecting, and controlling. That observer is born from thought. Thought comes first, not the observer. If there was no thinking, there would be no observer or thinker—just pure, total attention.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To end fear and sorrow, one must understand the duality between the observer and the observed, as this division creates conflict and time."
