  "text": "Change that’s forced or influenced isn’t real change. If you’re pushed to change by fear, a new trend, or propaganda, that’s just conforming. You might get it on an intellectual level, but truly understanding change without a motive? That’s something else entirely. 🤔\n\nYou’ve switched up your ideas and thoughts, but they’re still conditioned. Whether you’re thinking about Jesus, Buddha, or anyone else, it’s just thought. One thought can clash with another, leading to conflict, but that doesn’t mean real change is happening. It’s just one idea replacing another.\n\nSo, can we step outside of thought and create real change? All our consciousness—past, present, future—exists within thought. Any change that happens in that space isn’t genuine change. Real transformation requires breaking free from those mental boundaries. That’s what true meditation is about. 🧘‍♂️\n\nNow, let’s talk about real change. It can only happen when we move from the known to the unknown, not just from one known thing to another. Think about it. When we stick to the known, we rely on authority—like following a guru or a system—because we want certainty and success. Success is familiar; it’s something we can grasp. \n\nMost of us change for that reason—because we think it’ll make us happy or secure. But is that really change? True change, or revolution, happens when we venture into the unknown, where there’s no authority and the possibility of failure. If you’re only chasing guaranteed success, you’re still stuck in the same cycle, with yourself at the center of it all. 🌪️\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Real change occurs only when moving from the known to the unknown, free from authority and motives."
