  "text": "We think of love as a feeling, right? But when we say we love, we also bring in jealousy, fear, and anxiety. Love often comes with envy, the urge to own someone, and the fear of losing them. We label this mix as love, yet true love doesnâ€™t have to be tied to these negative feelings. We might call it pure or divine, but the truth is, weâ€™re often jealous and possessive. \n\nYou only really think about someone you love when theyâ€™re not around, when youâ€™re feeling lost or upset. As long as you feel you possess that person, you donâ€™t think about them much because thereâ€™s no disturbance. \n\nThinking kicks in when youâ€™re troubled, and if your idea of love is tied to your thoughts, youâ€™ll always be disturbed. Love isnâ€™t a mental game. Our minds get cluttered with jealousy, ambition, and the need to succeed. These thoughts fill our hearts, making it hard to truly love. If thereâ€™s smoke, how can there be a clear flame? ðŸ”¥\n\nWhen love is real, thereâ€™s no sense of duty. You share everythingâ€”your worries, your joysâ€”with your partner. You donâ€™t dominate or treat them like a tool for your needs. True love makes duty irrelevant. Itâ€™s the people lacking love who cling to rights and responsibilities. In many places, rules have taken over genuine affection. When love is present, everything is simple; without it, things get complicated. \n\nIf you truly care for your partner and kids, you wonâ€™t think about duties or rights. Take a moment to look inside yourself. Itâ€™s easy to laugh off hard truths, but thatâ€™s just a way to avoid facing them. If you see your partner as less than you, just someone to use when it suits you, then youâ€™ve created a world of rights and duties. When she stands up for herself, you throw those terms at her. A society that focuses on duties and rights is stagnant and falling apart. If you really check your heart and mind, you might find thereâ€™s no real love there. ðŸ’”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Love is often confused with possessiveness, jealousy, and duty, which obscures its true essence."
