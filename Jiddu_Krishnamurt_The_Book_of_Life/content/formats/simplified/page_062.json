  "text": "Discontent is just a way for the mind to find something to latch onto so it can chill. A passionate mind is all about exploring, seeking, and breaking through barriers. It doesn’t stick to traditions; it’s not settled or sure of itself. It’s like a young mind that’s always evolving. 🌱\n\nSo, how do you create this kind of mind? It just happens. A small-minded person can’t force it. If they try to be passionate, they’ll just shrink everything down to their own smallness. You have to see your own pettiness without trying to fix it. Get what I mean? Maybe not. But any limited mind, no matter how eager, will stay limited. A small mind might reach for the stars or master a skill, but it’s still small. When it says, “I need to be passionate to make a difference,” its passion will be tiny—like getting mad over a minor issue or thinking a little change in a small town is a big deal. If that small mind recognizes its own limitations, that awareness can spark a change. \n\nNow, let’s talk about lost passion. The word “passion” isn’t the same as actually feeling it. To truly experience passion, you need to let go of control and just listen to your desires—no matter how weak or strong they are. When you suppress or twist those desires, you cause serious harm. \n\nMany people have lost their passion. Maybe they felt it in their youth—dreams of wealth, fame, or a comfortable life. Society—basically, everyone around you—kills that fire. You end up fitting in with people who are lifeless and respectable, losing your own spark in the process. \n\nFinally, there’s passion without a cause. That’s pure intensity without any strings attached. But when passion has a cause, it comes with attachment, and that’s where sorrow begins. 💔\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A passionate mind is one that is constantly seeking and evolving, free from tradition and attachment."
