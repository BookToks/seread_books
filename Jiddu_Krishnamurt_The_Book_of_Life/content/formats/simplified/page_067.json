  "text": "**The Totality of Feeling**  \n\nWhat’s feeling all about? Think of it like thought. Feeling is a sensation. I see a flower, and I react. I either like it or I don’t. That response comes from my thoughts, which are shaped by my memories. So, I say, “I like that flower” or “I don’t like that flower.” It’s the same with feelings: “I like this feeling” or “I don’t like that feeling.”  \n\nNow, is love connected to feeling? Feeling is all about sensations—likes and dislikes, good and bad vibes, and everything in between. But is that feeling linked to love? Have you ever really looked at your surroundings—your street, your home, how you sit and talk? And what about the saints you admire? For them, passion often means sex, so they reject it, pushing beauty aside. By doing this, they turn sensation into a massive issue. They think, “Sensation will trap me; I’ll be a slave to desire, so I need to cut it out.”  \n\nBut here’s the thing: once you grasp feeling completely—not just bits and pieces—you'll understand what love truly is. When you can appreciate the beauty of a tree, a smile, or a sunset behind your town—when you see everything as a whole—then you’ll get what love is about.  \n\n**If You Do Not Name That Feeling**  \n\nWhen you notice a feeling, it tends to fade away. But if there’s an observer—a separate part of you that watches the feeling—then there’s a conflict. It’s crucial to understand how you view your feelings.  \n\nTake jealousy, for example. We all know what that feels like. How do you see your jealousy? When you observe it as something separate, you might try to change it or justify it. There’s a part of you that’s judging jealousy from a distance. Sure, it might vanish for a bit, but it returns because you haven’t recognized that jealousy is part of you.  \n\nWhat I’m saying is this: as soon as you label that feeling, you pull it into the old framework—the one built on words and opinions about right and wrong. But if you don’t name that feeling—which takes serious awareness and understanding—you’ll find there’s no separate observer, no thinker judging it. You’re not different from the feeling. There’s no “you” who feels it.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Understanding the totality of feeling is essential to truly knowing what love is, as it transcends mere sensations of like and dislike."
