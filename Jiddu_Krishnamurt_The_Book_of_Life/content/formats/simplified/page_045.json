  "text": "When we cling to people, we lose the essence of real relationships. Possessiveness kills connection. A lot of us hold on tight because without those things, we feel empty—like shells. We fill our lives with stuff: furniture, music, knowledge. But that noise we call living? It's just a distraction. When something disrupts that, we feel sorrow because we realize we’re just empty shells without meaning. \n\nTo really understand relationships, we need to be aware of everything they involve. That awareness can lead to genuine connections, revealing love's true depth and significance. \n\n**Being Related**\n\nWithout relationships, we don’t really exist. To be is to be connected. Many of us miss this—we think the world is just about our ties to others, whether it’s one person or a bunch. Our main issue is relationships. What we are inside shapes how we connect outside. If we don’t know ourselves, our relationships spiral into confusion. \n\nThat’s why personal connections matter so much, especially with family and friends. In a world full of big organizations and mass movements, we often hesitate to act on a smaller scale. We think, “What can I do alone? I need to join a big cause to make a difference.” But real change starts small—within ourselves and our immediate relationships. \n\nWhen I get to know myself, I can understand you better. And from that understanding, love grows. Love is what’s missing. There’s a lack of warmth and affection in our connections. Because we don’t have that love, we escape into mass actions, which only create more chaos and sadness. We fill our heads with plans for changing the world but ignore the one thing that truly matters: love.\n\n**You and I Are the Problem, Not the World**\n\nThe world isn’t separate from you and me. Society is built on the relationships we create with each other. So, you and I are the real issue, not the world itself. The world reflects who we are. To understand the world, we need to understand ourselves. We are the world, and our problems are its problems. \n\n**There Is No Such Thing as Living Alone**\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The essence of relationship lies in self-revelation and understanding oneself, which is crucial for genuine connection and love."
