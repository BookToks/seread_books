  "text": "As long as there’s an observer—like the part of you that seeks experiences, judges, and criticizes—there's a barrier between you and reality. When you feel physical pain, you don’t think about it; you just feel it. There’s no observer in that moment—just the pain itself. This direct experience leads to immediate action. You don’t need to think about what to do; you just react. Pain is part of you; it simply is.\n\nUntil you fully grasp this—that the observer is part of what you observe—life will be a constant battle between conflicting desires: what you want things to be and what they actually are. You can only see this clearly if you notice whether you’re observing things as an outsider, like when you look at a flower or a cloud.\n\nInstead of asking who has figured things out or what God is, focus all your attention on what is real right now. That’s where the unknown will reveal itself. Understanding what is known leads you to a deep silence, a creative emptiness that allows reality to emerge. Reality isn’t far away; it’s right here in the present. Just like the answer to a problem lies within the problem itself, reality exists in what is. If we can grasp this, we’ll uncover the truth.\n\nWhen I feel sorrow, I often get caught up in ideas about what I should do or how things should change. Those thoughts distract me from facing the actual situation. In moments of real danger, you don’t have time to think—you just act.\n\nOur minds get lazy, relying on formulas that help us avoid dealing with reality. We need to see the truth of our situation for ourselves. Take violence, for example. We often say we’re against it, especially in the East, but the truth is we are violent beings. We’ve chosen violence as a way of life, despite all the talk about nonviolence. Nonviolence is just an idea, a political tool, not a reality. \n\nThe fact is, I am violent; I feel anger. Why complicate it with ideas? It’s not about the concept of anger; it’s about actually facing the fact that I am angry. That’s what matters.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The observer's separation from the observed creates conflict, preventing immediate contact with reality and action in response to what is."
