  "text": "When you say you love your wife or husband, what do you really mean? Do you love what makes you happy? Or do you love what you think belongs to you? These are real questions, so don’t freak out. \n\nWhat we often love is the idea of “my wife” or “my husband,” not the actual person. The truth is, I don’t really know my partner, and I can’t truly know them if knowing just means recognizing them based on past experiences. Recognition relies on memory—memories of joy and pain, things we’ve clung to, and the stuff we’re attached to. How can we love when there’s fear, sadness, or loneliness? How can an ambitious person truly love? We’re all ambitious in one way or another, even if it’s for good reasons. \n\nTo really understand love, we need to let go of the past—of all our emotions, both good and bad. We must let go effortlessly, like we would with something toxic, because we understand its dangers. \n\nIn today’s world, it’s easy to lose that deep sense of feeling. I’m not talking about just being sentimental or overly emotional. I mean truly experiencing life—the sound of a bird singing, the way a leaf moves in the sunlight. Feeling things deeply is tough for most of us because we’re constantly dealing with problems. Everything we touch seems to turn into a challenge, and it feels like there’s no end to our troubles. The more problems we have, the less we’re able to feel. \n\nWhen I say “feeling,” I mean appreciating the curve of a branch, noticing the dirt on the road, feeling empathy for someone else’s sorrow, or being in awe of a sunset. These aren’t just emotions; they’re deeper experiences. Emotion and sentimentality can lead to cruelty and can be manipulated by society. But we need to cultivate strong feelings. The feeling for beauty, the power of a single word, the silence between words, and the clarity of sound—all of these create genuine feelings. Strong feelings make our minds more sensitive. \n\nRemember, there’s no feeling without thought, and behind thought is pleasure. They’re all connected: pleasure, words, thoughts, feelings—they work together. But when we observe without thought, feeling, or words, that’s pure energy. Unfortunately, energy gets wasted on words, associations, thoughts, and time, leaving us with no energy left to truly see.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** True love is often an attachment to the image of a person rather than an understanding of their true self, and to truly love, one must transcend past emotions and problems to experience deep feelings."
