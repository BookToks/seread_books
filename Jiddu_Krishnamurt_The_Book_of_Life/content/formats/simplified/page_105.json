  "text": "Truth is a fact, but you can only grasp it when you strip away everything that gets in the way. This includes your connections to stuff, your partner, other people, nature, and ideas. If you donâ€™t get the reality of these relationships, chasing after God just adds to the chaos. It becomes a distraction, and honestly, itâ€™s pointless. If youâ€™re controlling your partner or being controlled, or if youâ€™re all about possession, youâ€™re missing out on real love. Ambition and substitutes? They block you from knowing the truth. \n\nOnly those who arenâ€™t chasing after something can find truth. Itâ€™s not about striving or trying to hit a goal. Truth isnâ€™t a constant; itâ€™s seen in the moment. Itâ€™s always fresh and never sticks around. What was true yesterday isnâ€™t true today, and whatâ€™s true today might not be true tomorrow. The mind wants to cling to experiences it labels as truth, but thatâ€™s not how it works. Truth is about seeing the same smile as if itâ€™s brand new, seeing the same person in a new light, and experiencing life with fresh eyes. ðŸŒ±\n\n---\n\nIs God found by hunting him down? Can you really search for the unknowable? To find something, you need to know what youâ€™re after. If youâ€™re looking to find, what you discover is just a reflection of your own desires. And letâ€™s be real: desire isnâ€™t truth. Seeking truth actually denies it. Truth doesnâ€™t have a permanent home; thereâ€™s no map or guide. Words? They arenâ€™t truth either. Is truth tied to a specific place, climate, or group of people? Is it here but not there? Is one person a better guide than another? When you seek truth, what you find is rooted in ignorance because the search itself comes from not knowing. You canâ€™t hunt down reality; you have to stop searching for it to truly see it. \n\n---\n\nTruth canâ€™t be hoarded. Anything you accumulate will eventually fade away. But truth? It never withers. You find it moment by momentâ€”in thoughts, relationships, words, gestures, smiles, and even tears. If you and I can discover that and actually live it, then living becomes the way we find truth. We wonâ€™t just be spreading ideas; weâ€™ll be creative individualsâ€”not perfect, just creative, which is way more meaningful. ðŸŽ¨\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Truth can only be understood by removing the barriers between the mind and reality, and it is discovered moment to moment rather than through seeking or accumulation."
