  "text": "You can change your thoughts, but your mind is still conditioned. If you know where your mind is headed, it’s not real change. Knowing that just gives you a sense of satisfaction. As long as you're focused on getting rewards or avoiding punishment, you’re not truly changing. Most of us are just chasing what we want. Real change happens when your mind is free from what you already know. When that happens, your mind becomes incredibly still, and that’s when real transformation kicks in. 🌟\n\nTo really shift your consciousness, you have to stop analyzing and searching. This is tough. The mind needs to see what’s false and completely set it aside, without knowing what’s true. If you think you know the truth, you’re just swapping one idea for another. True renunciation happens when you let go of something without knowing what you’ll gain. This state of letting go is crucial. \n\nWhen you empty your consciousness of what you know, you can discover what’s true. Consciousness is built on knowledge, experiences, and memories from the past. These experiences shape how you see the present and future. While this knowledge is useful for everyday life, it can’t spark a real revolution in your consciousness. For that, you need complete emptiness. This emptiness comes when you can see what’s false, and once you do, that emptiness itself brings about a transformation. It’s a game-changer. 💥\n\nWhen an individual changes, the collective changes too. They’re connected, not separate. Some political groups try to force individuals to fit into a collective mold, but that’s not how it works. If we can dive into the problem of change together—figuring out how to change individually and what that means—then maybe, just by engaging in this process, real change can happen without you even trying. For me, any change that feels forced or mandatory isn’t true change at all. ✌️\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** True change requires complete emptiness and freedom from the known, as any change motivated by desire for satisfaction is not genuine transformation."
