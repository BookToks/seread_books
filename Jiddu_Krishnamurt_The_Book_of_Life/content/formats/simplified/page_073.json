  "text": "The whole thinking process is where freedom lives. The catch? We’re always stuck in our minds, which are tools for thought—whether it’s logical or not. And remember, thought is always limited. \n\n**Freedom from the Self**\n\nTo break free from all that conditioning, you need to see the whole picture without thinking. Sounds tricky, right? But try it out. Have you ever really looked or listened without reacting? You might think it’s impossible to see without thought, that no mind can be unconditioned. But when you say that, you’re already trapped by your own thinking. The truth is, you don’t really know.\n\nSo, can you look and be aware of your conditioning? I believe you can. Just notice if you’re a Hindu, a Socialist, or whatever—without labeling it as right or wrong. It’s tough to just see things as they are, so we often say it’s impossible. But I argue that only when you’re fully aware of your entire being without reacting does that conditioning fade away. That’s true freedom from the self. \n\n**Awareness May Burn Away the Problems**\n\nAll thinking is conditioned. There’s no such thing as totally free thinking. Our thoughts come from our conditioning—our background, culture, and environment. Even the books you read and the habits you have are shaped by this. If we can just be aware of this—really dig into what it means to be aware—we might be able to uncondition our minds without forcing it. Because the moment you try to ‘uncondition,’ you create a conflict. You’re just another part of the conditioning trying to change itself. \n\nBut you can be aware of your conditioning without conflict. That awareness, if you let it, might just burn away your problems. \n\n**There’s No Noble or Better Conditioning**\n\nDoesn’t the mind’s urge to break free from conditioning just create another pattern of resistance? Once you realize the mold you grew up in, you want to escape it. But that desire to be free can end up conditioning your mind in a new way. The old pattern pushes you to conform to authority, while the new one tells you to rebel against it. It’s a cycle.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To achieve true freedom, one must become aware of their conditioning without the interference of thought."
