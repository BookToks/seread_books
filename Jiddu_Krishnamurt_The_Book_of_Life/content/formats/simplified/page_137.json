  "text": "A fresh mind doesn’t weigh itself down with endless memories. Even if it faces tough times, it stays unscathed. \n\nYou can’t just go out and grab this kind of young mind. It’s not something you can buy or earn through hard work or sacrifice. There’s no price tag on it. But if you truly understand its importance and necessity, something shifts within you. \n\n**October 18**  \n**Let Go of All Methods**  \n\nSo, how do we get this new, religious mind? Do we need a system or method? A method means doing the same thing over and over, hoping for a result. But can a method really create a new mind? \n\nWhen you talk about “discipline,” it’s really just a method based on a certain pattern. That pattern promises a specific result, but it’s built on beliefs that are already set in stone. So, can any method, no matter how broad or narrow, actually bring about this new mind? If it can’t, then we should ditch the method entirely because it’s misleading. \n\nMethods only train the mind to achieve a desired outcome. You have to let go of all the mechanical ways of thinking. A mechanical mind is stuck in tradition; it can’t handle the unpredictable nature of life. So, we need to set aside all these mechanical methods. \n\n**October 19**  \n**A Mind Without Limits**  \n\nYou need a new mind—one that’s not tied to time, distance, or space. This mind has no boundaries or safe spots. It’s essential for tackling both eternal truths and the immediate challenges we face. \n\nSo, can each of us develop such a mind? Not slowly, not through cultivation, because that takes time. This needs to happen right now—it’s about having a timeless quality. Life and death are intertwined, and you can’t debate death like you can with life. So, is it possible to achieve this mind? Not as an accomplishment or a goal, because that implies time and space. We often cling to the idea that there’s a convenient way to get there, but...\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A new mind, free from mechanical processes and the constraints of time, is essential for addressing both immediate and eternal challenges in life."
