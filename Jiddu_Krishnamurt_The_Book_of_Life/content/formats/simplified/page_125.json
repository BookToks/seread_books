  "text": "The mind doesn’t come with a built-in knowledge bank. Knowledge is something we pick up over time, but learning is a continuous journey. Learning isn’t just about adding more info; it’s about being open and not tied down by what you already know. When the mind is stuck in its knowledge, it can’t truly learn. Real learning kicks in only when you stop clinging to past knowledge. \n\nFor many of us, it’s tough to tell the difference between learning and just collecting facts. We gain knowledge through experiences, reading, and listening. This is all about stacking up what we already know. We often think we’re learning when we’re really just piling on more info. But I’m talking about something deeper. Learning happens when you let go of past knowledge and see things fresh, without labels.\n\nA mind that’s truly learning is like a blank slate—innocent and open. In contrast, a mind that just gathers knowledge is old and stuck in the past. An innocent mind sees things clearly and is always learning without hoarding info. That’s the kind of mind that’s truly mature. \n\nSo, what is the mind? Instead of waiting for me to define it, look at your own thoughts. My words are just pointers; the real understanding comes from your own experience. Words like \"door\" or \"love\" aren’t the actual things—they’re just symbols. If you focus only on the words, you’ll miss the essence of what the mind really is.\n\nThe mind is your total awareness—how you experience life and think. It comes from the brain. Without the brain, there’s no mind, but the mind isn’t just a copy of the brain. It’s shaped by it. If the brain is limited or damaged, the mind will be too. The brain captures every sensation and feeling, creating what we call the mind, even though the mind operates independently.\n\nYou don’t have to take my word for it. Test it out for yourself!\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Learning is a continuous, non-acquisitive process that requires an innocent mind free from the authority of past knowledge."
