  "text": "It’s clear—this is an amazing way to dodge reality. But if we want to find the truth, we can’t just lock onto one way of living. We need to look at everything—our actions, ideas, and relationships. When we evaluate things like food, clothing, and shelter with clarity, we can actually discover reality. This isn’t about escaping; it’s about understanding. If we’re confused about the basics—like food, shelter, and how we relate to others—how can we ever find the truth? All we’ll do is create a fake version of reality. \n\nSo, God, truth, or reality can’t be grasped by a confused mind. That kind of mind is conditioned and limited. Before it can even think about reality or God, it needs to break free from those limits. Reality is the unknown, and what’s known isn’t real. ✨\n\n---\n\nA person who believes in God will never truly find God. If you’re open to reality, you can’t just believe in it. Beliefs are a form of self-defense, and only a narrow-minded person clings to beliefs about God. Think about pilots in war claiming God was with them while dropping bombs! You can’t say you believe in mercy and then exploit others or support war. As long as belief exists, the unknown remains out of reach. You can’t think about the unknown because thought is stuck in the past. \n\nYour mind can only project its own images, and those aren’t real. So, your god isn’t God; it’s just an image you created for yourself. Reality can only emerge when the mind understands itself fully and becomes empty. It needs to grasp its relationships—like with people and possessions—before it can be free. Only when the mind is completely still and not seeking anything can the eternal and timeless reveal itself. 🌌\n\n---\n\nWhat does it mean when someone says, “I don’t know if there’s a God or if there’s love”? That’s a state without any memory response. Don’t rush to answer this; your first response will just reflect what you think it should be. If you say, “It’s a state of negation,” you’re comparing it to what you already know, which means that state of “I don’t know” isn’t really there. \n\nThe mind that can honestly say, “I don’t know,” is in the best position to discover something new. But the person who insists, “I know,” is stuck in their own limited understanding. 🧠\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To find reality, the mind must first decondition itself from beliefs and limitations, achieving a state of openness and silence."
