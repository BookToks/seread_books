  "text": "If you're a Christian, your visions fit a certain mold. If you're a Hindu, Buddhist, or Muslim, they follow a different one. You see Christ or Krishna based on your upbringing and culture. So, what’s real: the vision or the mind shaped by these beliefs? The vision is just a reflection of your tradition. The real deal is the conditioning behind it, not the vision itself. Understanding this is simple, but our likes and dislikes complicate it. Our judgments and opinions cloud the truth. To grasp what’s real, we need to drop these evaluations. \n\n---\n\nWhen we give opinions about facts, we limit ourselves. Your take on a fact might differ from mine. This translation of facts is a trap that stops us from seeing what’s actually there. When we argue over opinions, nothing changes. You might notice more details, while I might see less. But facts are facts; they don’t need interpretation. Accepting them can be tough. We often twist facts to fit our biases, hopes, and fears. If we could just see the fact as it is, it would come alive on its own. The fact has its own energy that can guide us.\n\n---\n\nThere’s only one fact: everything is impermanent. We want to know if there’s a permanent state of being—not what we wish for, but the actual truth. Everything around us—our relationships, thoughts, feelings—is always changing. Knowing this, our minds crave stability: peace, love, security that time can’t touch. So, we create ideas of the soul and visions of eternal paradise. But this idea of permanence comes from impermanence, meaning it’s not truly lasting. The only constant is change. \n\n---\n\nYou want to know what reality is. But can you really describe the indescribable? Can you measure the unmeasurable? Can you catch the wind? If you try, is it still the wind? Measuring the immeasurable doesn’t capture reality.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Our perceptions and visions are shaped by our cultural conditioning, which obscures the actual facts of impermanence."
