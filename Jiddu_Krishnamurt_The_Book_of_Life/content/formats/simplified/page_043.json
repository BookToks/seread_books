  "text": "Without judging or making excuses, let’s figure this out. Unless we understand our confusion and contradictions, we’re stuck. Can craving ever be satisfied, or is it just a never-ending cycle? Craving, whether for something basic or something lofty, is always there—a relentless fire. Anything consumed by it turns to ashes, but the desire for more keeps burning. Both attachment and detachment hold us back, and we need to rise above both.  \n\n**March 14**  \n**Intensity Free of Attachment**  \n\nWhen passion exists without a reason, it’s pure intensity—no strings attached. But when passion has a cause, it brings attachment, and that’s where sorrow starts. Most of us cling to something: a person, a country, a belief. When what we cling to is gone or loses its meaning, we feel empty. We then try to fill that void by grabbing onto something new, which just becomes another source of passion.  \n\n**March 15**  \n**Relationship is a Mirror**  \n\nIn relationships, we reveal who we really are, right? It’s like looking in a mirror. But since many of us don’t like what we see, we try to change it—either positively or negatively. We notice something in ourselves through our relationships that we dislike, so we attempt to fix it. This means we already have a standard of who we think we should be. When we focus on that ideal, we lose sight of who we actually are in the moment.  \n\nIt’s crucial to get this because it’s where we often mess up. We avoid facing our true selves in relationships. If we’re only focused on self-improvement, we miss understanding our current reality.  \n\n**March 16**  \n**The Function of Relationship**  \n\nRelationships are often painful, and we see this in our daily lives. If there’s no tension, it’s not really a relationship; it’s just a comfy zone—a state many people prefer. The conflict lies between our desire for comfort and what’s real, between illusion and reality. If you can spot the illusion, you can set it aside and focus on truly understanding the relationship. But if you seek security in a relationship, you’re just investing in comfort and illusion. The beauty of a relationship lies in its inherent insecurity.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Understanding the process of craving and attachment is essential to transcending confusion and contradiction in relationships."
