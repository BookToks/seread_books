  "text": "**The Disorder That Time Creates**\n\nTime is all about moving from what is to what should be. We think, “I’m scared now, but someday I’ll be free of fear.” So, we see time as necessary for that freedom. But here’s the catch: to go from what is to what should be takes time. And time means putting in effort while we’re stuck in this gap. \n\nWe don’t like fear, so we try to understand it, analyze it, or even escape it. All this requires effort, and we’re used to that struggle. We’re constantly torn between our current reality and our ideal selves. The “ideal me” is just an idea, not the real deal. The real me can only change when I grasp the mess that time creates.\n\nCan I really ditch fear completely, right here and now? If I let fear linger, I’ll keep creating chaos. So, time isn’t the answer to freeing myself from fear; it’s actually a source of disorder. There’s no slow-and-steady way to eliminate fear, just like there’s no gradual way to get rid of the poison of nationalism. If we cling to nationalism while dreaming of global brotherhood, we’re just fueling wars and hatred in the meantime. Time is what causes that disorder.\n\n**Time Is a Poison**\n\nThink of a bottle labeled “poison” in your bathroom. You know it’s dangerous, so you’re careful around it, even in the dark. You don’t ask, “How can I avoid it?” You just know to stay alert. Time is like that poison; it creates chaos. If you truly see this, you can start to understand how to be free from fear right now. But if you still think time can help you escape, we’re not on the same page.\n\nThere’s something deeper here. We only know two kinds of time: physical and psychological, and we’re stuck in this tug-of-war. Physical time matters when you need to catch a bus or train, but if you completely reject psychological time, you might discover a different kind of time—one that’s not tied to either. I hope you’ll join me in exploring that kind of time! When that happens, time isn’t chaos; it’s pure order.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Time creates disorder and is a poison that hinders the immediate understanding and freedom from fear."
