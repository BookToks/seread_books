  "text": "**April 8**  \n**Sex**  \n\nSex is a problem because, in that moment, you forget yourself completely. You feel happy because the “me” disappears. You crave more of that feeling—where there’s no past or future pulling at you. It’s all about pure happiness. Makes sense, right? Since it brings you total joy and lets you forget everything else, you want more. But why? Because everywhere else in life, you're stuck in conflict. Economically, socially, religiously—those are all places where your self-consciousness grows, and that’s where the struggle lies. You only feel self-conscious when there’s conflict.  \n\nSo, the real issue isn’t sex; it’s how to break free from the self. You’ve tasted that blissful state where the self isn’t there, even if just for a moment. Where the self exists, there’s conflict, misery, and strife. That’s why you long for that self-free feeling.  \n\n**April 9**  \n**The Ultimate Escape**  \n\nWhat’s the real problem with sex? Is it the act itself or just the thoughts around it? It’s not the act—just like eating isn’t a problem. But if you obsess over eating (or anything else) all day, it becomes a problem. So why are you building it up? Movies, magazines, how people dress—they all hype up the idea of sex. Why does your mind fixate on it?  \n\nIt’s your issue. Why has it become such a big deal in your life? With so many other things to focus on, why is sex at the center? It’s because it offers an escape. It lets you forget yourself completely, even if just for a moment. Everything else in life—your job, religion, politics—emphasizes the “me.” So when you find that one thing that allows you to forget yourself, even briefly, you cling to it because that’s when you feel happy.  \n\nThat’s why sex turns into a complicated problem: you have to understand the mind that’s thinking about it.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sex is perceived as a problem because it represents a moment of self-forgetfulness and happiness, contrasting with the ongoing conflict of self-consciousness in other aspects of life."
