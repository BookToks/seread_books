  "text": "Understanding beauty and meditation is key to life. Life isn't just about the big moments; it includes your daily grind—like going to work, dealing with arguments, stress, anxiety, deep fears, love, and even hunger. \n\nGetting a grip on this whole experience—like the struggles, pressures, and politics—is what life is about. And figuring it all out is meditation. If you really get what life is, you’re always in a meditative state. It’s not about thinking on one thing; it’s about being aware of everything around you. \n\nTo truly see this whole existence, to dive into it without getting caught up, and to feel free from it all—that's real meditation. 🧘‍♀️\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Meditation involves understanding and freeing the mind from the totality of life's experiences and influences."
