  "text": "**December 15**  \n**Your Gods are Dividing You**  \n\nWhat’s going on in the world? You’ve got the Christian God, Hindu Gods, and Muslims with their own ideas of God. Each group claims to have the truth, but these different truths are like diseases, pulling people apart. In the hands of a few, these beliefs become tools for exploitation. You start sampling each belief, losing your ability to choose wisely because you’re hurting and just want a fix. You’ll grab any solution offered, whether it’s from Christians, Hindus, or anyone else. So, what’s happening? Your Gods are splitting you apart. You talk about the brotherhood of man and unity in God, yet you cling to these beliefs that actually deepen your divisions. It’s pretty clear.  \n\n**December 16**  \n**True Religion**  \n\nDo you even know what religion really is? It’s not about chanting or rituals, not about worshiping metal or stone idols, not about temples or churches. It’s not in reading the Bible or the Gita, or repeating a sacred name, or following some superstition created by people. None of that is true religion.  \n\nReligion is the feeling of goodness, that love flowing like a river, alive and moving. When you reach that state, you’ll find a moment where you stop searching altogether. That end of the search is the start of something completely new. The quest for God, for truth, and that deep sense of goodness isn’t about trying to be humble or good. It’s about reaching for something beyond your mind’s tricks. It’s about feeling that something, living in it, and being it—that’s true religion. But you can only do this if you leave the little pool you’ve dug for yourself and dive into the river of life. Then life has an amazing way of taking care of you because you’re part of it. No more worrying about what others say or don’t say—that’s the beauty of life.  \n\n**December 17**  \n**A Marvelous Escape**  \n\nWhat drives the search for God? And is that search even real? For many, it’s just an escape from reality. We need to be clear with ourselves: is this search for God a way to avoid the truth about everything—our relationships, the value of things, our ideas? If you’re looking for God just because you’re fed up with life and its struggles, then it’s an escape. You end up creating your own version of God, which isn’t really God at all. The God of temples and books? That’s not the real deal.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Beliefs in different gods and organized religions are causing division among people rather than fostering unity."
