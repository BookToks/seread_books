  "text": "with the issues that relationships bring, the answer isn’t to back away but to really get what love is. Only then can we grasp reality.\n\n---\n\nFebruary 11  \nBeyond belief  \n\nLife can be tough—ugly, painful, and full of sorrow. We crave some theory or idea to make sense of it all. So, we get stuck in explanations, theories, and words. Our beliefs dig in deep and become unshakeable because they hide our fear of the unknown. But we often ignore that fear. The stronger our beliefs, the more rigid our dogmas become. When we look at beliefs—like Christian, Hindu, or Buddhist—we see they create divides. Each belief comes with rituals that bind people and keep them apart. \n\nWe start asking what’s true and what all this struggle means, but we quickly get tangled in beliefs and rituals. Belief is a trap because it feeds the ego, making it bigger and stronger. We think believing in God or something is what makes us religious. You get that, right? If you don’t believe, society labels you an atheist and judges you. One group may condemn believers, while another criticizes non-believers. It’s all the same game. So, religion becomes about belief, and that belief influences our minds, keeping them from being free. True freedom is where you find what’s real, what God is—not through belief. Your beliefs shape what you think God should be.\n\n---\n\nFebruary 12  \nThe screen of belief  \n\nYou believe in God, and someone else doesn’t. That difference separates you. Beliefs are organized into religions like Hinduism, Buddhism, or Christianity, and they divide people. We get confused and think that belief will clear that confusion. But belief just layers on top of the confusion; it doesn’t help us face it. Instead, it’s an escape from the reality of our confusion. To truly understand the chaos, we don’t need belief. Belief acts as a barrier between us and our problems. \n\nReligion, which is just organized belief, becomes a way to avoid dealing with what is real. A person who believes in God or an afterlife is often running from the truth of who they are. Think about it: you know people who do rituals, chant, and pray, yet in their everyday lives, they can be cruel, ambitious, or dishonest. Can they really find God? Are they genuinely searching for God? Is God found just by repeating words?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Belief acts as a screen that separates individuals and prevents them from confronting their confusion and understanding reality."
