  "text": "**April 10**  \nWe’ve turned sex into a problem.  \n\nWhy do we make everything a problem? Why has sex become one of them? Why do we keep dragging problems around instead of just letting them go? We carry these issues day after day, year after year. Sure, sex is a big deal, and I’ll get to that, but the real question is: why do we make life itself a problem?  \n\nWork, sex, making money, thinking, feeling—everything about living—why do we see it as a problem? Is it because we always think from a fixed perspective? We’re stuck seeing things from a center outwards, but for most of us, that outer edge is the real center. So, everything we touch feels shallow. But life isn’t shallow; it needs us to dive deep. Because we’re only skimming the surface, we only get shallow reactions. Anything we do at the surface level will create problems, and that’s our reality—we’re okay living with all these surface-level issues.  \n\nProblems stick around as long as we stay on the surface, focusing on the “me” and our sensations. These can be tied to our identity, our nation, or whatever else our minds create. While we stay trapped in our thoughts, complications and problems will always follow. That’s all we know.\n\n**April 11**  \nWhat do you mean by love?  \n\nLove is something we can’t fully grasp. It only comes when we move beyond what we already know. When our minds let go of the known, that’s when love can happen. So, we need to think about love in a different way—negatively, not positively.  \n\nFor most of us, love means possessiveness, control, or being submissive. This need to possess leads to jealousy and the fear of losing what we think we own, and we end up normalizing this instinct. But possessiveness isn’t love. And being sentimental or overly emotional doesn’t equal love, either. Sensitivity and emotions are just sensations.  \n\nOnly love can change chaos, confusion, and conflict. No political system or theory can bring true peace or happiness. Where there’s real love, there’s no possessiveness or envy; there’s compassion and mercy—not just in theory, but in real life—for your partner, your kids, your neighbors, and everyone around you. Love is what brings mercy, beauty, order, and peace. Love shines through when the “you” fades away.\n\n**April 12**  \nAs long as we cling to possession, we’ll never truly love.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** We create problems in life, including sex, by living superficially and from a fixed point of view, which leads to complications and conflicts."
