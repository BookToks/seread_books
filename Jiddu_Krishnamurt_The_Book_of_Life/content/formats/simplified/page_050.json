  "text": "element of chaos, not a way to truly escape fear. Getting rid of fear isn’t a slow process, just like you can’t gradually eliminate nationalism’s poison. Nationalism brings wars, hatred, and division, creating chaos over time. \n\n---\n\nWhen I look at anger, I see it as an observer who is angry. I say, “I am angry.” But in that moment, there’s no “I”; that thought comes later, which involves time. Can I see anger without the time factor—the thoughts and words? This happens when I observe without the observer. I start to realize I can perceive without judgment or conclusions. I can \"see\" without thoughts. This means my mind is free from the conflict of ideas.\n\nSo, can I view fear not as something separate? \n\nIf I focus on a single fact without seeing how it connects to the bigger picture of the mind, I can start over with another fact. This helps me unlock the mind's potential. Looking at one fear—like the fear of death or being dominated—might just open that door. That’s what matters—not how to escape it. Once that door is open, fear fades away. \n\nThe mind is shaped by time, and time is thought—how mind-blowing is that? Time creates fear; it’s thought that breeds the fear of death. Time holds all the complexities of fear.\n\n---\n\nThe craving to become fuels fears; wanting to be or achieve creates dependence, which leads to fear. Not fearing isn’t just the opposite of fear or about being brave. Understanding fear’s roots is what stops it. In every desire to become, there’s a seed of fear. \n\nDependence on things, people, or ideas brings fear. This dependence comes from ignorance and a lack of self-awareness. Fear creates uncertainty in the mind and heart, blocking real communication and understanding. Through self-awareness, we start to uncover the causes of fear—both surface-level and deeper, accumulated fears. Fear is both natural and learned; it’s tied to the past. To break free from it, we must understand the past through the present. The past constantly tries to influence us.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Understanding the root causes of fear through self-awareness leads to its cessation, rather than seeking courage or methods to eliminate it."
