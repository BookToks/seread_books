  "text": "Is it possible to just be yourself in this world, without ambition? If you start to understand who you are without trying to change it, you’ll actually transform. You can totally live anonymously—no fame, no ambition, no cruelty. Happiness comes when you stop giving importance to the self, and this is part of real education.\n\nEveryone’s obsessed with success. You hear stories about the kid who studied hard and became a judge or the one who sold newspapers and became a millionaire. Society feeds you these success stories. But with great success often comes deep sorrow. Many of us get trapped in the chase for achievement, forgetting that understanding and letting go of sorrow is way more important.\n\nIf you had just one hour to live, what would you do? You’d probably sort out your affairs, make a will, and gather your loved ones. You’d ask for forgiveness and forgive them too. You’d let go of your desires and worldly concerns. If you can do that for an hour, why not for the days or years ahead? Give it a shot and see what happens.\n\nWhat is age, anyway? Is it just the number of years you’ve been alive? Sure, you age physically, but your mind ages too when it’s weighed down by experiences and struggles. An old mind can’t discover truth. A fresh, innocent mind is what’s needed. Innocence isn’t just for kids; it’s about experiencing life without clinging to past memories. \n\nYou have to experience everything—nature, suffering, life’s struggles—otherwise, you’re spiritually dead. But you should respond to these experiences without being stuck in them. It’s the weight of tradition and memories that makes the mind old. A mind that lets go of yesterday’s memories—both good and bad—stays fresh and innocent. Without that innocence, whether you’re ten or sixty, you won’t find true meaning.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Living without ambition and understanding oneself can lead to transformation and happiness, free from the burdens of societal success."
