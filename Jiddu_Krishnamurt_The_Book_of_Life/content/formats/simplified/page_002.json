  "text": "I don’t know if you’ve really listened to a bird before. To listen means your mind has to be quiet—not some mystical calm, just plain quiet. I’m sharing something, and to really hear me, you need to clear out all those buzzing thoughts. When you look at a flower, just look at it. Don’t name it or label it. The moment you do that, you stop seeing it. \n\nListening is tough. It’s hard to really hear a communist, a socialist, a congressman, a capitalist, or even your spouse, kids, neighbor, or a bird. Just listen. When you listen without ideas or thoughts cluttering your mind, you connect directly. You’ll know if what they’re saying is true or false without needing to debate it.\n\nNow, let’s talk about listening and freedom. When you try hard to listen, are you really listening? That effort can distract you from actually hearing. Think about something that brings you joy—do you make an effort to listen to that? No, you just enjoy it. \n\nAs long as your mind is busy with effort, comparisons, or judgments, you won’t grasp the truth or see falsehood for what it is. Listening is a complete act in itself—it brings freedom. But are you focusing on listening or just trying to fix the chaos inside? If you listen and stay aware of your conflicts without forcing them into a specific thought pattern, they might just fade away. \n\nWe’re always trying to be someone or achieve something, which keeps our minds racing. They never settle down enough to hear the noise of our struggles and pains. So, keep it simple. Don’t strive to become something or chase experiences.\n\nWhen you listen to me now, you’re not forcing yourself to pay attention; you’re just listening. If there’s truth in what you hear, you’ll notice a real change in you—not something you planned or wanted, but a transformation led by the truth itself. \n\nListen like this to everything—not just to me, but to others, to birds, to the sound of a train, or a bus passing by. The more you listen, the deeper your silence will become. That silence won’t be shattered by noise. It’s only when you resist or build walls against what you don’t want to hear that you struggle.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Listening requires a quiet mind free from distractions to truly understand and connect with what is being heard."
