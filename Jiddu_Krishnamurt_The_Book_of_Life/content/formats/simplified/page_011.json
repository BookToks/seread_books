  "text": "When we really pay attention to ourselves, isn’t life all about uncovering the “me,” the ego, the self? The self is super complex and can only be revealed in our relationships and daily actions—how we talk, judge, and even criticize ourselves and others. All of this shows how our thinking is shaped by past experiences. So, isn’t it crucial to be aware of this whole process? \n\nTrue awareness, moment by moment, leads us to discover the timeless and eternal. Without knowing ourselves, the eternal just becomes a word or an idea, something we escape to. But when we start to understand the “me” in all its daily activities, that understanding brings forth the timeless without any effort. Remember, the timeless isn’t a prize for knowing yourself; it can’t be chased or owned. It shows up when the mind is calm, and the mind can only be calm when it’s simple—when it stops storing judgments and comparisons. A simple mind is the one that understands what’s real, not a mind cluttered with words and info. Analyzing and calculating? That’s not simplicity.\n\nWithout self-knowledge, you can’t truly meditate. By “self-knowing,” I mean being aware of your thoughts, moods, words, and feelings—understanding how your mind works. It’s not about knowing some grand Supreme Self; that’s just another thought. Thought comes from your conditioning and memory. If you try to meditate without first grounding yourself in self-knowledge, you’re just fooling yourself. \n\nThis is super important for anyone serious about this journey. If you can’t grasp this, your meditation and real life will be worlds apart. You could meditate in all sorts of postures for ages, but if you don’t know yourself, it won’t mean anything. \n\nUnderstanding self-knowledge means being aware of the “me” that’s shaped by memories—just observing without jumping to conclusions. But that observation gets messed up when you start accumulating rules about what to do or not do. If you approach it with opinions like “I shouldn’t” or “I must,” you block the flow of what is actually happening. And if you block that flow, you miss out on real learning.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Self-knowledge is essential for understanding the self and achieving a state of meditation, as it reveals the conditioned nature of our thoughts and actions."
