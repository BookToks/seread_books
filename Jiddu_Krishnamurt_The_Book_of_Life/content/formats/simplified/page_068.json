  "text": "Whether you lean on your feelings or your brain, it can lead to despair because it doesnâ€™t really get you anywhere. Love isnâ€™t about pleasure or desire, and thatâ€™s key to understand.\n\nSo, whatâ€™s pleasure? Itâ€™s when you see something or feel something, and then you keep thinking about it. That constant dwelling gives you pleasure, and you want to repeat it. Ambition, for example, can feel good. Chasing power or status in the name of a country or an idea? That feels good too. But if thatâ€™s all youâ€™re after, youâ€™re missing real love, and you might end up causing chaos in the world. Wars, both inside and out, come from that lack of love.\n\nEmotions, enthusiasm, and that feel-good vibe donâ€™t connect to true affection or compassion. Theyâ€™re tied to thoughts and lead to ups and downs. Real love? It doesnâ€™t bring pain or sorrow because itâ€™s not about pleasure or desire.\n\nNow, can you love without thinking? Thinking is just reacting to past memories of pleasure or pain. You canâ€™t think without those leftover experiences. Love is separate from emotion and feeling; it canâ€™t be boxed into thought. Love is fresh, creative, and joyfulâ€”a flame without smoke. But that kind of love can be risky in society and relationships. So, thought steps in to manage it, making it safer to live with. \n\nWhen you truly love someone, you end up loving all of humanity. Thatâ€™s a big deal! It breaks down barriers and cravings for power. A person like that can be seen as a threat to society.\n\nTo experience real love, you need to let go of memory. Memory only exists when experiences arenâ€™t fully understood. Itâ€™s just leftover stuff from challenges we didnâ€™t completely get. Life is about facing new challenges, but our responses are often stuck in the past. Understanding those conditioned responses is crucial; you canâ€™t just ignore them. Itâ€™s about living each day fully. This kind of living is only possible when love fills your heartâ€”not with words or mental constructs. Where love exists, memory fades, and every moment feels like a fresh start.\n\nWhat happens when you donâ€™t label a feeling? You see it more clearly and relate to it differently, like how you view a flower without naming it. Youâ€™re forced to see it with fresh eyes. ðŸŒ¸\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Love is distinct from emotions and desires, as it transcends thought and memory, leading to a deeper, more genuine connection with humanity."
