  "text": "It’s pointless to hold onto old knowledge, especially if it’s someone else’s, no matter how wise they are. Relying on this knowledge can make you feel secure, but it stops you from truly seeking the truth. If you’re always leaning on what you know, you’re not really looking for what’s real.\n\nTo discover truth, there’s no set path. When you're trying to find something new, your mind needs to be calm. If your head is crammed with facts and past knowledge, it blocks new ideas. Many of us let our minds take over, which gets in the way of fresh insights. Knowledge and learning can actually hinder those who want to explore timeless truths.\n\nLearning is more than just collecting facts. There are two types: the first is about gaining skills or knowledge, like learning a language or a tech skill. The second is psychological learning, which comes from life experiences and traditions. These two types overlap a lot. \n\nRight now, let’s focus on psychological learning—the stuff we inherit over time. Is it really learning? It’s not about skills or techniques. It’s about whether the mind can truly learn in a psychological way. Often, we just use what we already know to tackle life’s challenges. But is that real learning? Learning should mean discovering something new, not just piling on what you already have.\n\nSo, when can we actually learn? Learning isn’t just about memorizing or hoarding knowledge. It’s about thinking clearly and starting from reality, not just beliefs. If your thoughts come from conclusions, you’re not really learning. True learning comes from a genuine desire to understand and engage with things for their own sake. It can only happen when there’s no pressure, and that pressure can come in many forms—like influence, attachment, threats, or even subtle rewards.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** True learning requires a quiet mind free from the burden of accumulated knowledge and coercion, allowing for genuine understanding and discovery."
