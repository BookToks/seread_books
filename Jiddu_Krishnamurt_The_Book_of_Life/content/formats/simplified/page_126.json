  "text": "We go through life like machines, stuck in our boring routines. The mind loves to latch onto a set way of living and won’t let go. It's like a nail holding everything together—our thoughts, our existence. The mind isn’t free or flexible; it’s always tied to its own center. It won’t stray far from that center, and when it does, it panics. But fear isn’t about the unknown; it’s about losing what we already know. It’s our dependence on the familiar that sparks fear. Fear tags along with desire, whether we want more or less. The mind constantly creates patterns, and with those patterns come time, fear, hope, and even death.\n\nThe mind is shaped by time. It’s influenced nonstop to think a certain way. In the past, organized religions were the main players in this game, but now governments are taking over. They want to mold your thoughts. On the surface, you might feel like you can resist, but deep down, your unconscious is packed with the weight of tradition, pushing you in a specific direction. Your conscious mind can steer itself to some degree, but beneath the surface, your ambitions, unresolved issues, compulsions, superstitions, and fears are all waiting to take control.\n\nThis entire mental landscape is shaped by time, filled with conflicts and adjustments, and it’s based on a lot of acceptance without real understanding. So we end up living in contradiction—wanting happiness while feeling unhappy. We preach nonviolence but act violently. The mind becomes a battlefield. We chase security, even though deep down, we know it doesn’t exist. The truth is, we don’t want to face that reality, so we keep seeking security, which only leads to more fear.\n\nThe mind is trapped in a pattern, existing within a frame of the past and future—full of despair, hope, confusion, and ideals. We all know this cycle. We want to break the old pattern and create a “new” one, but that new one is just a tweaked version of the old. Trying to create a new world this way is impossible. You can trick yourself and others, but unless you completely shatter the old pattern, real change can’t happen. Playing around with it won’t help; you’re not the solution to the world’s problems. To find order in chaos, breaking both the old and the so-called new patterns is crucial. That’s why understanding how the mind works is so important.\n\nSo, is it possible for the mind to be free from these patterns? Can it escape the endless cycle of desire? Yes, it absolutely can. Living in the moment is the key. To truly live is to be present.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The mind is trapped in patterns of thought shaped by time and tradition, hindering true freedom and understanding."
