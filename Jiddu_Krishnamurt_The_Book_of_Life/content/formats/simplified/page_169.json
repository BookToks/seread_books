  "text": "If you look at your thoughts and feelings without judging them, you’ll start to uncover what’s really going on inside you. \n\nThe key here is to study what you’ve written down with an open mind. As you do this, you’ll get a clearer picture of your state of being. In the light of self-awareness, you’ll see the roots of your conflicts, and they’ll start to fade away. Keep writing down your thoughts, feelings, intentions, and reactions—not just once or twice, but for several days. This practice will help you notice them instantly. ✍️ \n\nMeditation isn’t just about being self-aware; it’s also about letting go of the self. When you think clearly, you can meditate, and from that comes the peace of wisdom. In that calmness, you can truly understand the highest truths. \n\nWriting down your thoughts and feelings helps you become more aware inside.

That’s what meditation is all about. \n\nYou can only truly understand when your mind is calm, and it won’t be calm if you don’t know yourself. Ignorance can’t be fixed by following rules or authorities, whether they’re old or new. Beliefs can create barriers, and where there’s isolation, there’s no peace. Real tranquility comes from understanding yourself—recognizing the different parts of you that are often at odds. \n\nIt’s hard work, so we look for shortcuts we call meditation. But those shortcuts aren’t the real deal. Meditation is the first step to self-knowledge, and without it, you can’t really know yourself. \n\n---\n\nMeditation is about clearing your mind of all the clutter you’ve built up. If you manage to do that—though you might not, and that’s okay—then you’ll find...\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Meditation involves constant self-awareness and the abandonment of the self, leading to tranquility and self-knowledge."
