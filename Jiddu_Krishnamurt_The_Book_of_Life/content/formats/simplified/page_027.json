  "text": "Denying love is like being a sinner. The exploiter, who also gets exploited, thrives in this darkness and illusion. \n\nThe gap between you and reality? That’s on you. It’s your mind clinging to what it knows—certainty and security. You can’t fix this separation with rituals, disciplines, or sacrifices. No savior, master, or guru can bridge that gap. The divide isn’t between you and the real; it’s within you. \n\nTo tackle the growing conflict of desire, you need to understand yourself. This understanding comes from self-knowledge and staying aware of how you operate. \n\n---\n\nUnderstanding the self takes serious intelligence and constant vigilance. You’ve got to watch yourself closely so you don’t lose sight of it. I really want to dissolve my self. And yes, I believe it’s possible. But here’s the catch: the moment I say, “I want to dissolve this,” I’m still experiencing the self, which only makes it stronger. \n\nSo how can the self not experience? Creation happens when the self isn’t involved—it's not about intellect or self-projection. It’s something beyond our usual experiences. Can your mind be completely still, in a state of non-recognition? That’s when creation can happen—when the self is absent. Am I making sense? \n\nHere’s the dilemma: any movement in your mind, whether positive or negative, strengthens the “me.” Is it possible for your mind to not recognize? That can only happen in total silence—not the kind that comes from the self, which just reinforces it. \n\n---\n\nWhat is the self? The search for power, status, authority, and ambition—all of that is the self showing up in different ways. Understanding the self is crucial, and I know you feel that too. Let’s be serious about this. If we, as individuals—not as part of any group or society—can grasp this and act on it, real change can happen. \n\nWhen it becomes universal and well-organized, the self hides in that. But if you and I can truly love and bring that into our daily lives, then the essential revolution will finally take shape. 🌟\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The separation between reality and oneself is created by the mind's attachment to the known, and true understanding of the self requires constant awareness and self-knowledge."
