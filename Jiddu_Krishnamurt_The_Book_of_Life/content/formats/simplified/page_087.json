  "text": "The animal is violent. Humans, who come from that animal instinct, are also violent. It’s in our nature to be angry, jealous, envious, and to chase power and prestige. We want to dominate and be aggressive. Just look at the countless wars to see this violence in action. Yet, we’ve created this idea called “non-violence.” \n\nWhen there’s a war between countries, everyone gets caught up in it. They thrive on it. But when you’re actually violent and hold onto the ideal of non-violence, you’re stuck in a conflict. You’re always trying to be non-violent, which just adds to the struggle. You discipline yourself to avoid violence, but that’s also a conflict. So, if you’re violent while aiming for non-violence, you’re fundamentally still violent. \n\nThe first step is to recognize your own violence—don’t just try to be non-violent. See violence for what it is. Don’t try to change it, suppress it, or overcome it. Look at it like it’s the first time you’re seeing it. It’s like seeing a tree without any preconceived notions. You need to examine violence without the baggage that comes with the word itself. To see it without thought is to look at it with innocence. 🌱\n\nNow, can you acknowledge the violence both outside and inside you without any delay between noticing it and acting? If you can, then you’re free from violence. You’re completely free because you’re not letting time or ideology get in the way. This takes deep reflection, not just saying you agree or disagree. We’re so conditioned by our beliefs about violence that we never truly see it. Instead, we view violence through our ideologies, which creates a gap. When you allow for that gap, violence never ends. You keep acting violently while preaching non-violence.\n\nThe main reason for violence? Each of us is searching for security. We want to feel safe and certain inside. That urge for psychological security spills over into our need for security in the world. That’s why we have marriage laws—to possess someone and feel secure in that relationship. If that relationship feels threatened, we react violently. It’s all about that inward need for certainty. But the truth is, there’s no such thing as real security in any relationship. ✨\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Human beings are inherently violent due to their animalistic nature and the psychological need for security, which leads to conflict and aggression."
