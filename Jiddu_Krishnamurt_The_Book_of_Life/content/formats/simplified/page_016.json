  "text": "When love is present, the self disappears. \n\nTruth isn’t something you just recognize. To find it, you have to let go of belief, knowledge, experiences, and even the chase for virtue (which is different from actually being virtuous). A person who’s all about being virtuous can’t grasp reality. They might be a decent human, but that’s not the same as being someone who truly understands. For the person who knows truth, it just exists. \n\nA virtuous person is seen as righteous, but they can’t grasp what truth really is. Why? Because their virtue acts as a mask for the self, making it stronger. When they say, “I need to be free of greed,” even that non-greedy state just feeds the self. \n\nThat’s why it’s crucial to be poor—not just in material things, but also in beliefs and knowledge. Someone who’s loaded with worldly goods or rich in beliefs will only find darkness and create chaos and misery. But if we can grasp how the self operates, we’ll understand what love truly is. I promise, that’s the only change that can reshape the world. Love is separate from the self. The self can’t recognize love. You might say, “I love,” but in saying it, love fades away. When you truly know love, the self vanishes. \n\n---\n\nA person who understands life doesn’t cling to beliefs. Someone who loves has no beliefs—they just love. It’s the intellectuals who get caught up in beliefs because they’re always looking for security and avoiding risks. They create ideas and beliefs to hide behind. \n\nWhat if you confronted violence head-on? You’d be seen as a threat. The mind, trying to avoid danger, thinks, “I’ll aim for the ideal of nonviolence ten years from now,” which is just a fantasy. Understanding what actually is, matters more than chasing ideals, which are often false. \n\nTo grasp what is true requires a sharp, unbiased mind. We don’t want to face reality, so we come up with escapes and label them as ideals, beliefs, or even God. Only when I recognize what’s false can I see what’s true. A confused mind can’t find truth. \n\nSo, I need to identify what’s false in my relationships, ideas, and surroundings. Recognizing falsehood is the first step to uncovering truth, leading to joy and happiness.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Love cannot coexist with the self, and true understanding requires the dissolution of beliefs and the recognition of falsehoods."
