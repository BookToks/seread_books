  "text": "November 6  \nWhy is there crime?   \n\nSo, here’s the deal: there’s either a rebellion inside society or a full-on revolution outside of it. I call the big change outside a religious revolution. Anything that’s not religious is just a tweak of the old ways, not a real revolution. Right now, we’re seeing a lot of rebellion within society, which often shows up as crime. This happens because our education only trains people to fit into society—like getting a job, making money, and wanting more stuff. \n\nThat’s what our so-called education does everywhere—teaching the youth to conform, whether it’s religiously, morally, or economically. So, when they rebel, it doesn’t mean much. They just get suppressed, reformed, or controlled. This kind of rebellion isn’t creative at all. But with the right education, we could help people understand better by freeing their minds from all the conditioning. We need to encourage young folks to be aware of the influences that make them conform.  \n\nNovember 7  \nLife’s purpose  \n\nEveryone has their take on life’s purpose. Some will quote sacred texts, while others will just make stuff up. Political groups have one idea, religious groups another, and it goes on. So, what’s the purpose of life when you’re feeling lost? When I’m confused, I ask, “What’s the purpose of life?” hoping to find clarity. But how can I get a solid answer if I’m all mixed up? \n\nIf my mind is confused or anxious, any answer I get will be just as muddled. It’s like a blind person asking, “What is light?” If I explain it, they’ll only understand through their blindness. But if they could see, they wouldn’t even ask that question. \n\nIn the same way, if you can clear up your own confusion, you’ll discover the purpose of life without needing to ask. Just focus on freeing yourself from what causes that confusion.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Crime arises from societal revolt and the failure of education to foster true understanding and creativity."
