  "text": "September 19  \nBe an Outsider  \n\nHave you noticed how much our lives revolve around the intellect? Everything around us—newspapers, magazines—pushes us to be rational. I’m not against reason; it’s essential to think clearly and sharply. But if you look closely, the intellect constantly analyzes why we fit in or don’t, why being an outsider helps us find truth, and so on. We’ve learned to pick ourselves apart.  \n\nSo, we have this intellect that questions, analyzes, and draws conclusions. Then there’s pure feeling, which gets interrupted and colored by the intellect. When the intellect messes with pure feeling, we end up with a mediocre mind. On one side, there’s intellect, reasoning based on likes, dislikes, and past experiences. On the other side, there’s feeling, tainted by society and fear. Can these two together reveal what’s true? Or is there just perception, and nothing else?  \n\nSeptember 20  \nA Mind That Is Learning  \n\nWhat does learning really mean? Is it just about piling up knowledge and gathering info? That’s one type of learning, sure. If you’re studying engineering, you’re learning math and other subjects to use that knowledge practically. But is that true learning? I argue that this “additive” learning isn’t real learning at all. It’s just building up memory, which becomes mechanical. A mind that works like a machine can’t truly learn.  \n\nA machine can only learn in that basic, additive way. Real learning is different. A mind that learns never says, “I know,” because knowledge is always limited. Learning is a continuous process. It doesn’t start with what you know and then add more; that’s just a mechanical process. For me, learning is about discovering myself in each moment. This self is vibrant, alive, with no clear start or end. When I say, “I know myself,” that’s when learning stops in terms of accumulated knowledge. Learning isn’t about collecting; it’s a flow of understanding without a beginning or an end.  \n\nSeptember 21  \nKnowledge Assumes Authority  \n\nLearning can’t happen when you’re just acquiring knowledge; they don’t mix well. The act of learning requires a state where the mind is free from the constraints of knowledge.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The intellect's analysis can hinder pure feeling, leading to a mediocre mind that struggles to perceive truth."
