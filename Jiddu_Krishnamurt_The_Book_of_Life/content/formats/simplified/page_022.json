  "text": "Politicians and religious groups might promise us happiness in the future, but that doesn’t help when we’re hungry right now. We’ve tried everything else. The only way to truly understand love is to ditch ideas and just act. \n\n---\n\nI wonder if evil even exists? Let’s explore this together. We say there’s good and evil—like envy is bad and love is good. But why do we split life into these categories? Sure, we feel envy, hate, and brutality, but why label them as evil? Isn’t it more about a distracted mind? When we pay full attention—being totally aware and alert—there’s no good or evil, just a state of being awake. \n\nGoodness isn’t a quality or virtue; it’s love. When you genuinely love someone, you don’t think about what’s good or bad. Your whole self is filled with that love. The conflict arises only when we stop paying attention and loving. Then, what we are becomes the “evil,” and what we think we should be becomes the “good.” \n\nWatch your own mind. When you stop trying to become something, you find a kind of action that isn’t stagnation; it’s total attention, which is goodness. \n\n---\n\nAre you aware of the pain around us? It’s crushing. Who created it? All of us. We’re responsible for it. Just as we’ve created a little good, we’ve also created a lot of evil. Good and evil are part of us, yet they also exist independently. When we think narrowly—filled with greed and hate—we add to the evil that harms us. This struggle between good and evil is always present because we keep creating it. \n\nWe’re caught up in this cycle of wanting and not wanting, loving and hating. To rise above good and evil, we need to understand their root—craving. By grasping the concepts of merit and demerit, we can break free from both. \n\nOpposites can’t be fused; they need to be transcended by dissolving craving. Each opposite must be examined deeply and thoroughly through all layers of our consciousness. This process will spark a new understanding that isn’t driven by craving or time.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The division of life into good and evil creates conflict, and true understanding transcends this duality through love and complete attention."
