  "text": "Can the mind be free from distractions? This means—can it let thoughts, both good and bad, just flow by without picking favorites? The second you latch onto one thought, whether it’s positive or negative, you’re stuck in the past. If you really listen—not just hear, but deeply engage—you’ll notice a kind of stability that isn’t tied to your mind. That’s the freedom from past experiences.\n\nBut here’s the catch: you can’t completely ditch the past. You can observe it as it passes, but don’t get caught up in it. A free mind can watch without making choices. When you start choosing from your memories, you get trapped; and when you’re stuck in the past, you miss out on what’s real, true, fresh, and untainted.\n\n---\n\nThinking creates effort.\n\n“How do I stay clear of negative thoughts?” Is there really a thinker who’s separate from the thoughts, from the bad ones? Pay attention to your own mind. We often say, “There’s me, the one who thinks,” “This thought is bad,” “I need to control this thought,” “I need to stick to this thought.” But is this ‘I’ really separate from all that? Is it different from envy or negativity? The ‘I’ that claims it’s distinct from these thoughts is constantly battling, trying to push them away, trying to become something better. So, you end up in this struggle, trying to dismiss unwanted thoughts.\n\nIn the act of thinking, we create this problem of effort. You with me? Then you feel the need for discipline—like trying to control your thoughts. The ‘I’ tries to manage the thoughts that aren’t good, striving to be less envious or less violent. This struggle gives birth to the very effort we’re trying to escape. That’s just the reality of our daily lives.\n\n---\n\nA free mind has humility.\n\nHave you ever thought about psychological dependence? If you dig deep, you’ll see that many of us feel really lonely. A lot of us have shallow, empty minds. We often don’t even know what love truly means. Because of this loneliness and lack of fulfillment, we cling to things—like family. We become dependent on them. And when a partner turns away, jealousy kicks in. But jealousy isn’t love; the love society recognizes within families is often just a cover for deeper issues.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The mind can achieve freedom by observing thoughts without attachment or judgment, allowing for true understanding beyond the past."
