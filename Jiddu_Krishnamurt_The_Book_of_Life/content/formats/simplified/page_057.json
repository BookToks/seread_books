  "text": "What we call love is really just a mental thing. Look around, folks. If love were different, our lives, marriages, and relationships would be totally changed. We tie ourselves to others not through true connection but through contracts we call love or marriage. Love doesn’t merge or adjust; it’s not personal or impersonal—it’s a state of being. When someone wants to merge with something greater, they’re just trying to escape pain and confusion. But the mind still feels separate, which is a mess. \n\nLove isn’t about merging or separating; it’s a state of being that the mind can’t grasp. The mind can label it, but those words aren’t love. Only when the mind is quiet can it truly know love, and that quietness isn’t something you can just practice.\n\nNow, let’s talk about marriage. It involves sex, love, companionship, and connection. Without love, marriage is a joke—it’s just about getting your needs met. Loving someone is tough, right? Love can only exist when the self is out of the picture. Without love, relationships hurt. They might feel good for a bit, but they lead to boredom and routine. Then, sexual issues become a big deal. \n\nBefore diving into marriage, we need to really understand love. Love is pure. Without it, you can’t be pure. You might be single, but that doesn’t mean you’re chaste if love isn’t there. If you aspire to be chaste, that desire isn’t love; it’s just wanting to be something you think is great, which won’t help you find truth. Chasing ideals doesn’t lead to love and only creates a sense of importance, and where you feel important, love can’t exist.\n\nLove isn’t a mental thing, right? It’s not just about sex either. Love can’t be boxed into a formula. Without love, you’re just in a relationship; without love, you get married. Then you “adjust” to each other. Nice phrase, huh? But that’s just a mental game. Adjustments are all about the mind. If you truly love someone, there’s no need for adjustment—there’s just complete connection. When love is absent, that’s when we start adjusting, and that’s what marriage becomes. \n\nMarriage can fail because it often leads to conflict—a battle between two people. It’s complicated, especially since desires and urges are strong. A mind that’s just adjusting can never be pure. A mind chasing happiness through sex will never find true love.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** What we call love is a mental construct that often leads to conflict and adjustment rather than true connection."
