  "text": "made respectable. That’s just another way to dodge our true selves. Every form of resistance creates dependence. A mind that depends can never be free. \n\nYou need that freedom. A free mind is humble. And a humble mind can learn—unlike one that resists. Learning is powerful; it’s about understanding, not just stacking up facts. Accumulating knowledge is easy—it’s just moving from what you already know to more of the same. But real learning is about stepping into the unknown. That’s where growth happens. \n\nWe never question why we depend. \n\nWhy do we depend? Inside, we cling to beliefs, systems, and philosophies. We look to others for guidance and a path to happiness. We’re always searching for some kind of security. But can the mind ever break free from this dependence? This doesn’t mean we need to be independent—that’s just a reaction to dependence. \n\nIf we can explore this without trying to escape from dependence, we can dig deeper. We accept dependence as necessary and think it’s inevitable. But have we ever really questioned why we seek it? Deep down, we crave security and stability. When we’re confused, we want someone to pull us out. In trying to avoid confusion, we end up creating dependence, which becomes our authority. \n\nWhen we rely on others for our inner peace, we create a ton of problems—like attachment. Yet, we rarely examine the root issue of dependence itself. Maybe if we approach this intelligently and with awareness, we’ll see that dependence isn’t the core issue—it’s just a way to escape something deeper. \n\nWhat is that deeper issue? We know we depend on people, ideas, or systems of thought. But why? \n\nHonestly, I don’t think dependence is the real problem. There’s a deeper factor driving it. If we can figure that out, both dependence and the struggle for freedom will lose their grip. All the issues tied to dependence will fade away. So, what’s really going on in our minds?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Dependence arises from a deeper need for security and understanding, which hinders true freedom and learning."
