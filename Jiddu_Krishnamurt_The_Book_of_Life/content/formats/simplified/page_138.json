  "text": "Time is not your friend when it comes to finding truth; that's just a myth. Time is an illusion in this way. What really matters is having a clear mind, now and always. \n\nPicture this: if your house is on fire, you donâ€™t stop to debate if youâ€™re Hindu, Muslim, or Buddhist, or to discuss ancient texts. Anyone caught up in that while the house burns down is completely missing the point. You might not even realize the danger because youâ€™re too numb or weak. \n\nIf you think itâ€™s impossible to change, then youâ€™ve locked yourself out of any chance to grow. But if you believe it might be possible (and itâ€™s not just wishful thinking), then thereâ€™s hope. Get the difference?\n\nTo tap into a new mindset, you have to understand how the old brain works, but it also needs to chill out. It should be active but calm. You following me? If you want to discover the truth for yourselfâ€”like whether God is realâ€”you canâ€™t just rely on what others say. Your old brain is shaped by years of tradition, culture, and social pressures, and it needs to quiet down. Otherwise, itâ€™ll just spit out its old beliefs and biases.\n\nYou need to question everythingâ€”your own experiences and anyone else's. It doesnâ€™t matter who they are. By asking questions, being curious, and really listening, you can calm that old brain. It wonâ€™t be asleep; it will be alert but quiet, having reached that state through observation and investigation. To investigate, you need light, and that light is your constant awareness.\n\nListen up! But donâ€™t just rely on what you already knowâ€”thatâ€™s tough to do. When you hear something new, your mind often jumps in with its conclusions and past memories. Youâ€™re not really listening; youâ€™re just waiting for answers about lifeâ€™s complexities. Real listening happens when your mind is calm, when thereâ€™s a pause between whatâ€™s being said and your reaction. In that pause, thereâ€™s a quietness, a silence. ðŸŒŸ\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To discover a new mind, one must quiet the old brain's reactions and listen attentively without the interference of past experiences or beliefs."
