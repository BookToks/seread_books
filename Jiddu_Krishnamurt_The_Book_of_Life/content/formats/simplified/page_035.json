  "text": "Greed and hate just add to the chaos that tears us apart. This whole good vs. evil struggle? We create it ourselves. It’s like a cycle of wanting and not wanting, loving and hating, craving and letting go. We keep spinning in this duality where our thoughts and feelings get trapped. \n\nTo break free from this cycle, we need to understand the root cause: craving. When we grasp the difference between merit and demerit, we can escape both. You can’t merge opposites; they need to be transcended by dissolving craving. Each opposite has to be deeply explored through all levels of our consciousness. By doing this, we awaken a new understanding that isn’t tied to craving or time.\n\nEvil exists in the world, and we contribute to it just as much as we contribute to the good. Sadly, people seem to bond more over hate than kindness. A wise person sees the causes of good and evil and, through understanding, frees their thoughts and feelings from this conflict.\n\n---\n\nThe current global crisis is like nothing we’ve seen before. Sure, there have been all kinds of crises throughout history—social, political, economic. They come and go. But this one? It’s different because it’s not just about money or physical stuff; it’s about ideas. \n\nWe’re fighting over ideas and justifying terrible actions like murder for a \"righteous\" cause, which is unprecedented. In the past, we recognized murder as wrong, but now it’s seen as a way to achieve a noble goal. We sacrifice the present for a supposedly better future, believing that the ends justify the means. This mindset suggests that a wrong action can lead to a right outcome, all wrapped up in fancy ideas. But let’s be clear: evil is evil; it can’t lead to good. War doesn’t bring peace.\n\n---\n\nIf I’m being good just to get something out of it, is that real goodness? Or is true goodness something that exists without any motive? Is good just the opposite of bad? Every opposite contains the seed of its counterpart. There’s greed, and then there’s the idea of being non-greedy. But when the mind tries to be non-greedy, it’s still driven by greed because it wants to achieve something. Greed is all about desire, acquisition, and expansion.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The crisis of good and evil is exacerbated by the justification of immoral actions through ideation, leading to a misunderstanding of true goodness."
