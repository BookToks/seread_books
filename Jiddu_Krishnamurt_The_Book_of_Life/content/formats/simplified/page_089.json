  "text": "The individual is key. Sure, ideas and social structures matter, but to make them work, you need people. Their ignorance, greed, and fear keep the cycle of hate and chaos alive. When individuals change, they can impact the world filled with these negative traits. The world mirrors you. If you’re stuck in thoughtlessness, ignorance, and greed, that’s what you’ll see. But when you become aware, thoughtful, and sincere, you break away from the pain and sorrow caused by those ugly traits. You find a sense of wholeness. 🌍\n\nNow, let’s talk about fighting. Whatever you battle, you often become. If I’m angry and you respond with anger, we just create more anger. You become what I am. If I’m acting evil and you fight me with evil, you’re just joining the dark side, no matter how justified you feel. Using brutal means against brutality only makes you brutal too. This cycle has been going on for ages. \n\nThere’s got to be a better way than meeting hate with hate. If I try to fight my anger with violence, I’m using the wrong method to reach a good outcome, and that good outcome disappears. We need to understand anger, not just try to crush it. Anger has roots, and without understanding those roots, we can’t escape it. \n\nWe’ve created our enemies, and becoming like them doesn’t end the conflict. To stop feeding enmity, we must understand its causes. This takes a lot of self-awareness and adaptability because what we are shapes society. Our thoughts and actions create both friends and foes. It’s more crucial to focus on our own mindset than to get caught up in the battle against others. Right thinking can end division. Love goes beyond just friends and enemies. ❤️\n\nWhat are we really looking for? In this chaotic world, everyone is chasing peace and happiness. It’s essential to figure out what we’re truly seeking. In a world full of turmoil, wars, and strife, we all want a safe space where we can find some peace. That’s what we’re after. ✌️\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The individual’s ignorance, greed, and fear perpetuate societal violence, and true change requires self-awareness and understanding rather than fighting hate with hate."
