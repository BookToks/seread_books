  "text": "Try to match your actions to that—everything is knowledge, right? But to find something new, you’ve got to go solo. Start fresh, stripped of knowledge. It’s too easy to have experiences based on what you already know or believe, but those experiences are just self-projections and totally fake. \n\n**September 17**  \n**Knowledge is not wisdom**  \n\nIn our quest for knowledge, we’re losing love. We’re dulling our sense of beauty and our awareness of cruelty. We’re getting specialized but losing our wholeness. Wisdom can’t be swapped for knowledge; no amount of facts will save us from suffering. Knowledge is important, sure, and science has its role, but if we let knowledge choke our minds and hearts, life feels pointless. \n\nInformation keeps piling up, but it’s always limited. Wisdom is endless; it includes knowledge and how to act. But we grab onto a branch and think we’ve got the whole tree. Knowing just a part can’t give us the joy of the whole. The intellect is just a piece of the puzzle. \n\nWe’ve split intellect from feeling, focusing too much on the brain and neglecting our emotions. We’re like a three-legged table with one leg way longer than the others—no balance. Our education sharpens our intellect, making it cunning and greedy, which takes center stage in our lives. But true intelligence is more than just intellect; it’s about blending reason and love. And you can only have that when you know yourself deeply. \n\n**September 18**  \n**The function of the intellect**  \n\nHave you thought about what the intellect really is? It works well at a certain level, but when it messes with those pure feelings, we slide into mediocrity. Knowing what the intellect does and recognizing that pure feeling—without letting them clash—is all about having sharp awareness. \n\nThe intellect’s job is to inquire, analyze, and dig deeper. But because we want inner security and feel anxious about life, we cling to conclusions. One commitment leads to another, and I’m telling you, a mind stuck in conclusions stops thinking and inquiring.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Knowledge can lead to experiences that are ultimately false, while true wisdom requires a balance of intellect and feeling, fostering self-knowledge and understanding."
