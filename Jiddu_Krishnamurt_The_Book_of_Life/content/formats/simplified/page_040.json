  "text": "**March 6**  \n**The “Me” is the Possession**  \n\nRenouncing stuff or sacrificing for others isn’t some grand act to admire. We cling to possessions because they define us. These can be material things, knowledge, ideas, virtues, or even fame. Without these, the “me” fades away; it’s made up of what we own—our stuff, our values, our names. The fear of not existing drives us to cling to these things. We think that higher status or better possessions will fill that void. When what we have isn’t cutting it or hurts, we ditch it for something that feels better. The ultimate “thing” we chase? Often, it’s God or some big idea like the State.  \n\nIf you’re not ready to embrace being nothing (which is actually true), you’ll keep feeling sorrow and conflict. Being okay with nothing isn’t about forcing it or renouncing things; it’s about seeing reality as it is. Understanding this reality frees you from the fear of insecurity, which leads to attachment and the false idea of detachment. Loving what is, is where wisdom starts. Love connects us; renunciation and sacrifice just isolate us.  \n\n**March 7**  \n**To Exploit is to Be Exploited**  \n\nMost of us crave power, and that creates a hierarchy—like novices and masters, or even levels among masters. We often enjoy exploiting others and being exploited ourselves. This system, whether obvious or not, supports that. When you exploit, you’re also being exploited. Wanting to use others for your own needs leads to dependency. When you depend on something, you have to hold onto it, and then it ends up controlling you. Without these dependencies—whether subtle or obvious—you feel empty, like you don’t matter. To escape the fear of being nothing, you latch onto organizations, ideologies, or religions. This creates a cycle of exploitation.  \n\n**March 8**  \n**The Cultivation of Detachment**  \n\nDetachment? It’s a myth. What really exists is attachment. The mind creates the idea of detachment to cope with the pain of being attached. When you try to detach from something, you’re just attaching to something else. It’s all one big cycle. You might be attached to your partner, your kids, your beliefs, or traditions. When you react against that attachment, you think you’re being detached. But that’s just another form of attachment. Trying to cultivate detachment comes from sorrow and pain. You want to escape that pain.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The \"me\" is defined by possessions and attachments, and true freedom comes from recognizing the illusion of these attachments rather than renouncing them."
