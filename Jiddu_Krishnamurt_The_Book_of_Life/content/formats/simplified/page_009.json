  "text": "Most of us are cool with authority because it gives us a sense of stability and safety. But if you really want to understand this psychological shift, you have to break free from authority, right? You canâ€™t depend on any authority, whether you made it up or someone else did. But is that even possible? Can I stop relying on my own experiences? \n\nEven after ditching the usual sources of authorityâ€”like books, teachers, or religionsâ€”I still feel like I can trust my own judgment and experiences. But can I really? My experiences come from my conditioning, just like yours do. If I grew up as a Muslim, Buddhist, or Hindu, my experiences are shaped by my cultural and social background, just like yours. So, can I really trust that? Can I look to my past for guidance and hope, when itâ€™s all just memories and conditioning?\n\nWhen I think about all this, I realize thereâ€™s only one way for real change to happen: when the mind is totally clear of the pastâ€”when thereâ€™s no analyzer, no judgment, no authority at all. ðŸŒŸ\n\n---\n\nTo tackle the countless problems we all face, self-knowledge is key. But gaining self-awareness isnâ€™t easyâ€”it doesnâ€™t mean isolating yourself. Knowing yourself is crucial, but you canâ€™t do it by shutting out relationships. Itâ€™s a mistake to think you can fully understand yourself by being alone, seeing a therapist, or reading a book. \n\nSelf-knowledge is a journey, not a destination. To really know yourself, you need to be aware of how you act in relationshipsâ€”with society, family, and friends. You discover who you are not in solitude, but in connection with others. This requires sharp awareness and insight. ðŸ‘€\n\n---\n\nTransforming the world starts with transforming yourself, since your self is part of the bigger picture of human existence. To change, you need self-knowledge. Without knowing who you are, you canâ€™t think clearly, and without that understanding, thereâ€™s no real change. You have to see yourself as you truly are, not just as you wish to beâ€”because wishes are just illusions. Only what truly exists can be changed. âœ¨\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To achieve true self-knowledge and transformation, one must be free from all forms of authority and conditioning, understanding oneself in the context of relationships rather than isolation."
