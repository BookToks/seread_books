  "text": "**February 5**  \n**Beyond All Experiencing**  \n\nGetting to know yourself takes serious smarts and constant attention. You gotta watch closely, so you don’t lose track. When I say I want to get rid of my self, I believe it’s possible. But hold up. The moment I declare, “I want to dissolve this,” and then chase after that, I’m just feeding the self. So, how can I avoid experiencing the self? Here’s the thing: true creation happens when the self isn’t involved. Creation isn’t about intellect or self-promotion; it’s something way beyond our usual experiences. \n\nCan the mind chill out completely, without recognizing anything? That’s when real creation can happen—when the self is totally absent. Am I making sense? The real issue is this: any movement of the mind, whether positive or negative, is an experience that just boosts the “me.” Is it even possible for the mind to not recognize? That can only happen in total silence, but not the kind that’s an experience of the self, which just ends up reinforcing it.  \n\n**February 6**  \n**What Is the Self?**  \n\nThe self shows up as the need for power, status, authority, ambition—you name it. But what really matters is understanding the self, and I’m sure you get that. Let’s take this seriously. If we, as individuals (not just part of some group or society), can grasp this and act on it, we could spark a real revolution. When the self gets all organized and universal, it hides in that. But if we can love and apply this in our daily lives, that essential revolution will happen.  \n\nSo, what do I mean by the self? It’s the idea, the memories, the conclusions, the experiences—basically all the intentions, whether we can name them or not. It’s the conscious effort to exist or not, plus all the accumulated memories, both personal and collective. All of this, whether it shows up in actions or as virtue, is the self. It includes competition and the desire to stand out. We know it’s a problem when we face it; it’s actually kind of evil. I’m using “evil” on purpose because the self divides and encloses us. Even its so-called noble actions are isolated. We get this. We also recognize those amazing moments when the self isn’t around, where there’s no effort involved—those moments happen when there’s love.  \n\n**February 7**\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Understanding the self requires deep awareness and the recognition that the self's experiences often reinforce its existence, hindering true creation and love."
