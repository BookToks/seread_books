  "text": "Authority pops up everywhere: society, family, religion, you name it. But just ignoring authority or ditching its symbols isn’t enough. \n\nSwitching from one tradition to another or jumping from one leader to another is just a surface-level move. To really get what authority is all about, we need deep awareness and insight. We have to be free right from the start, not just at the end.\n\n---\n\nWe listen with hope and fear. We look for someone to light the way, but we often don’t pay enough attention to truly understand. If a liberated person meets our desires, we accept them; if not, we keep searching. But what most of us really want is some kind of gratification. The key isn’t just spotting a liberated person; it’s about understanding yourself. No authority, now or later, can teach you about yourself. Without self-knowledge, you can’t break free from ignorance and sorrow.\n\n---\n\nWhy do we follow? Why do we accept authority? We latch onto someone else’s experience, then doubt it. This search for authority often leads to disillusionment, which can be pretty painful. We blame the leaders or teachers we once trusted but don’t look at our own need for someone to guide us. Once we get this craving, we can start to understand the importance of doubt.\n\n---\n\nSelf-awareness is tough. Most of us want an easy way out, so we create authority to shape our lives. This could be societal, like the State, or personal, like a guru or savior. Any kind of authority can blind us and make us thoughtless. Since being thoughtful often brings pain, we surrender to authority. But authority leads to power, and power usually gets corrupted. It messes up not just the one in charge but also those who follow. The authority of knowledge and experience can twist things, whether it’s from a Master, a representative, or a priest. What really matters is your own life and the conflicts within you, not the pattern or the leader. The authority of a Master or priest can distract you from confronting your own inner struggles.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Merely rejecting authority without understanding its deeper implications is superficial and does not lead to true liberation or self-knowledge."
