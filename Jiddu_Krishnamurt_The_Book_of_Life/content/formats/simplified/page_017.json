  "text": "Does belief spark enthusiasm? Can that excitement last without a belief? And do we even need enthusiasm, or is there another kind of energy we should tap into? Most of us get hyped about thingsâ€”concerts, workouts, picnics. But if we donâ€™t keep feeding that enthusiasm, it fades, and we just switch to something else. So, is there a force inside us that doesnâ€™t rely on belief? ðŸ¤”\n\nNow, do we actually need any beliefs? If so, why? Think about it: we donâ€™t need to believe in sunshine, mountains, or rivers. We donâ€™t even need to believe that we argue with our partners. Life can be tough, full of pain and conflictâ€”thatâ€™s just real. But we cling to beliefs when we want to escape reality.\n\nYour religion or belief in God? Itâ€™s often just a way to dodge whatâ€™s real. A wealthy person might get rich through cruelty and dishonesty but still believe in God. You might also hold onto beliefs while being envious or suspicious. Does collecting sacred texts make you religious? Not really. \n\nTrue religion isnâ€™t about escaping facts; itâ€™s about understanding who you are in your daily life. It shows in how you speak and treat othersâ€”your family, friends, and even those who work for you. If you donâ€™t grasp your relationships, confusion will reign. A confused mind only creates more chaos and conflict. If you run from reality, you wonâ€™t find God. A mind stirred up by belief canâ€™t grasp the truth. But if you get how you relate to things, people, and ideasâ€”and stop struggling with those issuesâ€”then you can understand love. Thatâ€™s when you start to see reality. ðŸŒŸ\n\nLife can be rough, filled with pain and sorrow. We often seek theories or doctrines to make sense of it all, getting stuck in explanations and beliefs. These beliefs can become rock-solid, rooted in our fear of the unknown. But we rarely confront that fear; we just look away. The stronger the belief, the stronger the division it creates among people. Each dogmaâ€”whether Christian, Hindu, or Buddhistâ€”keeps us apart.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Belief serves as an escape from reality, hindering true understanding and relationships, while genuine religion arises from comprehending one's actual circumstances."
