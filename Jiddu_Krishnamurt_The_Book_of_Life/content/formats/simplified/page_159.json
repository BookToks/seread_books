  "text": "“That’s asking too much. You can’t live like that in this crazy world where you’ve got to hustle at the office, make money, raise kids, and deal with your partner’s nagging. But what’s being said connects directly to daily life. If it doesn’t, it’s pointless. Out of this aloneness comes a strong virtue that feels pure and gentle. Mistakes? They don’t matter much. What counts is feeling completely alone and untainted. Only then can your mind grasp what’s beyond words and imagination. \n\nOne of the big reasons for sorrow is the deep loneliness we all feel. You can have friends, beliefs, tons of knowledge, and be super social, chatting endlessly about politics (which is often just gossip), but that loneliness doesn’t go away. So, can you face it without comparing it to anything else? Just see it for what it is, without trying to escape or cover it up? If you do, loneliness transforms into something else entirely.\n\nWe’re not truly alone. We’re shaped by countless influences—family, culture, media. We’re not original; we’re secondhand. When you’re totally alone, not tied to any family, nation, or culture, you become an outsider to all thoughts and actions. Only someone who is completely alone is innocent, and this innocence frees the mind from sorrow.\n\nTo create a new world, a fresh civilization, or new art—something untouched by tradition, fear, or ambition—you need a mind that is completely anonymous and alone. This means rebelling against conformity and the idea of being respectable. The respectable person is often mediocre because they rely on outside influences for happiness—what their neighbor thinks, what their guru says, or what sacred texts dictate. Their mind isn’t alone. They’re always accompanied by the weight of these ideas.\n\nIsn’t it crucial to understand the impact of these influences and how they shape the “me,” which contradicts the idea of being anonymous? Seeing this is key.”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** True aloneness, free from external influences and attachments, is essential for experiencing purity, innocence, and the potential to create a new society."
