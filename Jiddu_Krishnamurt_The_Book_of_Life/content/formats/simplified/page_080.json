  "text": "You’ve listened and reacted, but that means you’re not truly seeing the fact. Instead, you’re just translating it or sharing your opinion about it. Real listening happens without judgment or evaluation. When you do this, the fact itself sparks an energy that can wipe out ambition and conflict. \n\n**June 8**  \n**Attention Without Resistance**  \n\nThink about what space is. There’s space in this room, between your hostel and here, between the riverbanks. But what about space in your mind? Is it so cluttered that there’s no room at all? If your mind has space, it also has silence. From that silence, everything else flows. You can listen and pay attention without resistance. That’s why having mental space is crucial. When your mind isn’t packed or constantly busy, you can hear that dog barking, the train crossing the bridge, and also fully grasp what someone is saying right in front of you. A mind with space is alive, not dead. \n\n**June 9**  \n**Attention Free of Effort**  \n\nCan you pay attention without being absorbed in something? Without focusing on an object? Without any motives or pressures? You can, and that’s the real kind of attention. Anything else is just indulgence or mind tricks. If you can focus completely without getting lost in something or feeling excluded, you’ll discover what meditation truly is. In that state, there’s no effort, no division, no struggle, and no chasing after results. Meditation is about freeing your mind from rigid systems and giving attention freely. \n\n**June 10**  \n**Attention That Is Not Exclusive**  \n\nThere’s a difference between focusing on something specific and having attention that isn’t tied to an object. Concentrating on a particular idea or belief is exclusive. But there’s also a kind of awareness that’s open and inclusive. The same goes for discontent. There’s a form of discontent that has no motive, isn’t born from frustration, and can’t be channeled into something else. Maybe I’m not using the perfect words, but this deep discontent is essential. Without it, all other discontent just leads to temporary satisfaction.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** True attention arises from a mind free of clutter and resistance, allowing for genuine listening and understanding."
