  "text": "Thought is always limited by the thinker, who is shaped by their experiences; the thinker isn’t free. Whenever thought happens, ideas pop up right after. But when action is driven by an idea, it just adds to the confusion. So, can we act without ideas? Yes, and that’s where love comes in. Love isn’t just an idea or a feeling; it’s not about holding back or self-protection. To truly grasp love, we need to see how ideas work. \n\nCan we ditch all those other ways and embrace love as the only path to redemption? No political or religious approach will fix this. This isn’t just a theory to ponder; it’s something you have to live out.\n\nWhen you love, do you think about ideas? Don’t just accept it—really dig into it. Look deeply because every other method we’ve tried hasn’t solved our suffering. Politicians and religious groups might promise happiness in the future, but that doesn’t help when you’re hungry right now. We’ve explored every avenue, and to find love, we must understand ideas and then let them go. \n\n---\n\nNow, is there such a thing as evil? Let’s explore this together. We often say there’s good and evil—like love versus envy. But why do we split life into good and bad, creating this conflict? Sure, envy, hate, and brutality exist, but is it necessary to label them? Isn’t it all just a distracted mind? When we’re fully attentive, there’s no evil or good—just awareness. \n\nGoodness isn’t a trait or virtue; it’s a state of love. When you truly love someone, you don’t think in terms of good or bad; you’re just filled with that love. Conflict arises only when attention and love fade, creating a gap between who we are and who we think we should be. In that gap, what we are becomes “evil,” and what we aspire to is labeled “good.”\n\nWatch your own mind. You’ll notice that when you stop thinking about becoming something, you enter a state of total attention. That’s where goodness lives—not in stagnation, but in pure awareness.\n\n---\n\nAre you aware of the sorrow around us? Who created it? Each of us did. We’re responsible for both good and evil. They’re part of us, yet they also exist independently. When we think and feel narrowly—out of envy or fear—we contribute to this conflict.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Action can only be truly liberated through love, which transcends the limitations of ideas and conditioned thought."
