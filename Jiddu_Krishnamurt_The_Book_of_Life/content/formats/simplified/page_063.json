  "text": "We all get attached—whether it’s to a person, a country, or a belief. When that attachment fades or disappears, we often feel empty and inadequate. So, we latch onto something new, and the cycle continues. \n\nTake a moment to examine your own heart and mind. Think of me as a mirror reflecting you. If you don’t want to look, that’s cool. But if you do, do it honestly and intensely. Don’t just look to fix your pain or guilt; look to understand this powerful passion that often leads to sorrow.\n\nWhen passion has a reason behind it, it turns into lust. If you’re passionate about someone or something, that can create conflict and struggle. You might be chasing a feeling or trying to hold onto a moment that’s already passed. But the passion I’m talking about is different. It’s not tied to a cause, so it doesn’t create that inner turmoil.\n\n---\n\nMay 1  \nA mind rich with innocence  \n\nReal truth—like the true God, not the ones we create—doesn’t want a damaged, shallow mind. It seeks a healthy, rich mind filled with innocence. This means a mind untouched by past experiences, free from the constraints of time. The gods we invent may accept dullness and suffering, but the real thing desires a complete human being. One whose heart is full, clear, and able to deeply feel—whether it’s the beauty of a tree, the laughter of a child, or the pain of someone struggling to eat.\n\nYou need to cultivate this extraordinary sensitivity to everything—animals, the mess of life, the struggles of those in poverty. This isn’t just about having emotions that come and go; it’s about being completely aware with all your senses—your eyes, ears, body, and voice. You have to be sensitive all the time. Without this level of sensitivity, there’s no real intelligence. Intelligence grows from being aware and observant.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Our attachments lead to emptiness and sorrow, and true understanding requires examining our passions without seeking to dissolve our miseries."
