  "text": "Perceiving something can be a mind-blowing experience. Have you ever really taken a moment to see a flower, a face, the sky, or the sea? Sure, you notice them while zooming by in a bus or car, but have you actually stopped to look at a flower? When you do, what happens? You start naming it, thinking about its species, or saying, “Wow, those colors are amazing! I want to grow that in my garden or give it to someone.” The moment you do that, your mind starts chattering, and you miss the real experience of the flower. \n\nYou only truly perceive something when your mind is quiet, without any noise. If you can gaze at the evening star over the sea without distraction, you’ll really see its incredible beauty. And when you perceive beauty, don’t you also feel love? Beauty and love are intertwined. Without love, beauty loses its meaning, and without beauty, love feels empty. Beauty exists in forms, words, and actions. If there’s no love, actions become lifeless, just products of society or culture. But when your mind perceives without any disturbance, it can dive deep into itself. That kind of perception is timeless. You don’t need to force it; there’s no discipline or method to learn it.\n\nYou have one tool: your mind, which is also your brain. To uncover the truth, you need to understand how your mind works. If your mind is twisted, you won’t see things clearly. If it’s limited, you can’t grasp the limitless. To truly perceive, your mind needs to be straightened out and cleansed of conditioning and fear. It also needs to be free from knowledge because knowledge can distort your view. The mind has incredible potential to create and imagine, but sometimes you need to set that aside to keep your mind clear and simple. Only an innocent mind—one that has experienced a lot but is free from biases—can discover what lies beyond just brain and mind. Otherwise, what you find will be tainted by your past experiences and conditioning.\n\nSo, why does the mind feel old? It gets stuck in habits—whether they're about work, relationships, or beliefs. It's weighed down by countless memories and experiences, scarred by sorrow. Because of this, the mind can’t see anything new; it just keeps rehashing what it already knows, always referencing past experiences and authority. It becomes an old mind.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** True perception occurs when the mind is silent and free from conditioning, allowing for the experience of beauty and love."
