  "text": "Sometimes, you just know the truth about something instantly—like realizing you don’t really belong to anything. That’s perception: seeing the truth right away, without overthinking or analyzing. It’s different from intuition, which we often throw around casually.\n\nFor me, it’s all about that direct perception—no reasoning, no calculations, no deep dives into analysis. Sure, you need a sharp mind to analyze, but if you’re stuck in that mindset, you miss out on real truth.\n\nIf you take a moment to reflect on yourself, you’ll understand why you feel attached or committed to things. If you dig deeper, you’ll notice how that commitment can limit your freedom and dignity. When you see this clearly, you’re free—you don’t have to struggle to be free. That’s why perception matters.\n\nUnderstanding yourself isn’t about piling up knowledge or experiences; that just builds memory. True self-understanding happens moment by moment. If you just stack up knowledge, it can block deeper understanding because it becomes the lens through which you view everything.\n\nImagine you’ve never read a book or followed any teachings. How would you find the meaning of life? You’d need to start by figuring out how you think, right? You can’t just project your thoughts into the future and create a comforting idea of God—that’s too simplistic. Understanding your own thinking process is the first step to discovering something new.\n\nWhen we say knowledge can hold you back, we’re not talking about practical skills—like driving or operating machines. Those skills are useful. We mean a different kind of knowledge: the creative joy that can’t be found in facts or what others have experienced. To be truly creative, you have to let go of the past, moment by moment, because it’s the past that keeps creeping into your present. Clinging to old info or what others have said, no matter how wise, can hold you back.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Perception of truth is immediate and essential for freedom, unlike the limitations imposed by reasoning and accumulated knowledge."
