  "text": "If youâ€™re stuck in a belief system, it wonâ€™t set you free. The only thing that can liberate you is the truthâ€”but you have to discover it yourself, not just be convinced by someone else. Youâ€™ve got to dive into the unknown. ðŸŒŠ\n\n---\n\nTake a walk, and youâ€™ll see natureâ€™s beautyâ€”the vibrant green fields and vast skies. Youâ€™ll hear kids laughing. But even with all that, thereâ€™s still a sense of sorrow. A woman in labor feels anguish; death brings sorrow; when youâ€™re excited for something that doesnâ€™t happen, that hurts too. Nations can decline, and corruption exists both collectively and individually. Look closely at your own lifeâ€”thereâ€™s sorrow in not fulfilling your potential, in feeling small, and in unrecognized pain.\n\nBut thereâ€™s laughter too! Laughing for no reason, feeling joy without needing anything in returnâ€”thatâ€™s amazing. But we rarely experience that. Weâ€™re weighed down by sorrow; life often feels like a struggle, and we seldom know what itâ€™s like to love fully.\n\nWe want solutions, methods to lighten our burdens, so we avoid confronting sorrow. We escape into myths, images, or speculation, hoping to dodge the weight of it all.\n\nSorrow can end, but not through any system or method. It disappears when you truly see things as they are.\n\n---\n\nHow do you face sorrow? Most of us do it on the surface. Our education, training, and societal influences make us superficial. A shallow mind runs to church, clings to beliefs, or hides behind ideas. Those are just escapes for a mind in sorrow. If you canâ€™t find refuge, you build walls around yourself, becoming cynical or indifferent, or you react in unhealthy ways. All these defenses stop you from digging deeper.\n\nObserve your own mind. Notice how you rationalize your sorrows, lose yourself in work or ideas, or cling to beliefs in God or an afterlife. If those explanations donâ€™t satisfy you, you might escape through drinking, casual relationships, or by becoming bitter and hard. This cycle has been passed down through generations.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sorrow is an inherent part of life that often goes unexamined, as people seek superficial escapes rather than confronting it directly."
