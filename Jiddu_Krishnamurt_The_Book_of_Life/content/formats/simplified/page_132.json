  "text": "Truth hits you like a lightning bolt ⚡️\n\nUnderstanding comes in an instant. That moment doesn’t stretch over time. It’s fresh and immediate. What’s happened in the past won’t give you real understanding. If you’re chasing continuity—like wanting lasting love or peace—you’re stuck in time. That stuff isn’t timeless.\n\nA pointless chase 🏃‍♂️💨\n\nAs long as we’re stuck in time, we’ll fear death. We think, “I need to find the ultimate truth before I die, or at least in my next life.” But all our thoughts are rooted in time. They’re just echoes of what we already know. Trying to grasp immortality with that mindset is pointless. It’s only interesting to philosophers and theorists. \n\nIf I want to find truth right now—not tomorrow—don’t I need to stop clinging to my memories? Can I die to my past while still living? Not by losing my memory, but by letting go of the “me” that keeps holding on. In this time-bound world, can my mind create a space where the observer and the experience aren’t separate? As long as I exist as a separate thinker, I’ll always fear death.\n\nIf the mind can truly grasp all this—understand the whole process of consciousness and see how futile it is to search for the timeless through time—then maybe there’s a kind of death that leads to creativity beyond time.\n\nSeeing clearly 👀\n\nWhy do some people see clearly while others don’t? It’s because one is caught in time, while the other isn’t. When you see something, it’s an action of your entire being, free from time. You don’t think about how to get there gradually; you just see it all at once, and that perception drives action. \n\nI struggle to see the whole picture. I want to know what will let me see everything at once—life’s beauty, ugliness, joy, and sorrow. You see it all, while I only catch bits and pieces.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Truth and understanding are instantaneous and timeless, contrasting with the continuity and fear inherent in our perception of time."
