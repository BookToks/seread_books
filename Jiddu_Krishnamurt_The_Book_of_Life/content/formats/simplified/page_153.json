So, can the mind break free from its conditioning? \n\nNovember 22  \nLove is not pleasure  \n\nTo get love, you first need to understand pleasure. They’re not the same. Love is something else entirely. And to really get pleasure, you have to learn about it. For most people, sex is a big deal. Why? Because instead of facing it, you run away. Some people, like sannyasis (those who renounce worldly life), try to escape by taking vows of celibacy. But check this out: by denying something that’s part of you—like your physical needs—you’re just making yourself dry inside. There’s a constant battle happening within.  \n\nSo, we usually have two ways to deal with problems: suppressing them or running away. But suppressing is just another form of escape. We create all sorts of elaborate ways to dodge issues—intellectual, emotional, or just everyday distractions. The sannyasi thinks he’s solved the problem by running away, but he’s just pushed it down. He may look simple on the outside, but inside, it’s a whole different story. How do you actually solve that problem?  \n\nNovember 23  \nLove is not cultivated  \n\nYou can’t force love to grow. Love isn’t split into divine or physical; it’s just love. Asking, “Do you love everyone?” is a silly question. Think of a flower with a nice scent: it doesn’t care who comes to smell it or who ignores it. That’s how love works. Love isn’t just a memory or something you think about. It happens naturally, like compassion, when you’ve figured out life’s big issues—fear, greed, envy, despair, and hope. An ambitious person can’t truly love. If you’re super attached to your family, you’re missing out on real love. Jealousy has nothing to do with love either. When you say, “I love my wife,” but then feel jealous, that’s not real love.  \n\nLove means having great freedom—not just doing whatever you want. Love shows up when your mind is calm, open, and not focused on yourself. These aren’t just nice ideas. If you lack love, you can chase after all the goals in the world—social causes, politics, writing, whatever—but you’re still missing out on life. Without love, your problems will just keep piling up. But with love, you can do anything without fear or conflict. Love is the core of virtue. A mind that doesn’t experience love isn’t truly spiritual. Only a loving mind can break free from problems and appreciate the beauty of love and truth.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Love cannot be cultivated or reduced to pleasure, and it arises naturally from a mind free of conditioning and self-centeredness."
