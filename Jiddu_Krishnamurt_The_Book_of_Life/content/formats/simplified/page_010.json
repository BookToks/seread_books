  "text": "To really know yourself, you need to be super alert. Why? Because who you are is always changing. If you're stuck on a specific belief or way of doing things, you can't keep up. To truly understand yourself, you need to be aware and free from all those beliefs and ideals. They just mess with how you see things. \n\nIf you‚Äôre greedy or envious, just wishing to be non-violent or non-greedy doesn‚Äôt help. You have to face the real you, whether that‚Äôs ugly or beautiful, wicked or playful. This honest understanding is where real virtue starts. And virtue? It's key because it brings freedom. ‚ú®\n\n---\n\nWithout knowing yourself, experiences can lead to illusions. But with self-knowledge, experiences help you respond to challenges without weighing you down with memories. Self-knowledge is about discovering your thoughts, intentions, and desires in real-time. There‚Äôs no such thing as ‚Äúyour experience‚Äù or ‚Äúmy experience.‚Äù Saying ‚Äúmy experience‚Äù shows a lack of understanding and acceptance of illusion. \n\n---\n\nThere‚Äôs no set method for gaining self-knowledge. Wanting a method usually means you‚Äôre looking for a specific outcome, and that‚Äôs what most people want. We lean on authorities‚Äîwhether people or systems‚Äîbecause we want results that make us feel secure. But we often don‚Äôt want to dive deep into our own impulses and thoughts, both conscious and unconscious. Instead, we chase systems that promise results. \n\nWhen you follow a method, you end up needing authorities like teachers or gurus to give you what you want. But that‚Äôs not the path to truly knowing yourself. Authority can block your understanding of who you are. Sure, it might give you a temporary sense of security, but it stops you from fully being aware of yourself and ultimately takes away your freedom. And remember, true creativity only comes from self-knowledge. üå±\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To truly know oneself, one must cultivate an alert and free mind, unbound by beliefs or authority, as this understanding is the foundation of virtue and creativity."
