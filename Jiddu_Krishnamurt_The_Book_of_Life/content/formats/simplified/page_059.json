  "text": "Those trying to be celibate to reach God are missing the point. Theyâ€™re chasing a goal, swapping the end result for sex, which is just fear. Without love in their hearts, they canâ€™t find purity, and only a pure heart can discover reality. A heart thatâ€™s disciplined or suppressed doesnâ€™t know love. If youâ€™re stuck in habits or sensationsâ€”whether religious, physical, or emotionalâ€”you canâ€™t truly experience love. Idealists just mimic others and canâ€™t really give themselves without thinking about their own needs. Only when your mind and heart are free of fear and routine, filled with generosity and compassion, can you find love. That love is what we call chaste. ðŸ’–\n\nIs punishing yourself a religious life? Is torturing your body or mind a sign of understanding? Can you find reality through denial? Do you really think renunciation brings peace? The journey matters way more than the destination. The end may be important, but the means are what really count. You need to understand what is real, not bury it under ideals and clever excuses. Sorrow doesnâ€™t lead to happiness. Passion needs to be understood, not suppressed or replaced. Any substitute you create will only strengthen what hasnâ€™t been loved or understood. To love passion means to embrace it fully. You canâ€™t love something if you resent it or have fixed ideas about it. How can you love and understand passion if youâ€™ve vowed against it? A vow is just resistance, and what you resist will ultimately overpower you. Truth canâ€™t be conquered; it wonâ€™t reveal itself if you try to grab it. Truth comes quietly, often when you least expect it. What you think you know isnâ€™t truth; itâ€™s just an idea. The shadow isnâ€™t the real thing. ðŸŒŸ\n\nTo achieve liberation, you donâ€™t need anything. You canâ€™t buy it through bargaining, sacrifice, or elimination. If you try, youâ€™ll end up with something fake, not real. Truth canâ€™t be purchased; thereâ€™s no method to reach it. If there is, the end wonâ€™t be truth, because means and end are oneâ€”theyâ€™re not separate. Using chastity as a way to reach liberation or truth is a denial of truth. Chastity isnâ€™t a currency to buy it.\n\nWhy do we think chastity is so important? What do we mean by sex? Itâ€™s not just the act; itâ€™s about thinking, feeling, anticipating, and escaping from it. Thatâ€™s where our struggle liesâ€”sensation and wanting more. Focus on yourself, not on others. Why are your thoughts so consumed with sex? Chastity can only exist where thereâ€™s love, and without love, chastity is just lust in disguise. To become chaste means transforming into something else. ðŸŒˆ\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Chastity arises from love, not from suppression or the pursuit of results."
