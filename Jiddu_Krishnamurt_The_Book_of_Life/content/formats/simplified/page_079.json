  "text": "If you ask, “How do I save energy?” you’re just creating a pattern of thought about it. Then you end up living by that pattern, which leads to contradictions. Instead, notice where you’re wasting your energy. That’s where real understanding starts.\n\nWhen it comes to energy, theories don’t cut it. They’re childish. Think of a person needing surgery for cancer. It’s pointless to debate the tools for the operation; the fact is they need surgery. Similarly, your mind needs to be free from being a slave to thought. \n\nAll thoughts are inventions. Gadgets, rockets, and even space exploration come from thought and knowledge. But invention isn’t true creation. Thought is limited and conditioned, so it can’t be genuinely creative. Only energy that isn’t tied to thought can be creative. \n\nNow, let’s talk about energy itself. An idea about energy is not the same as experiencing energy. We may have concepts for high-quality energy, but those ideas are separate from the actual renewing energy we can tap into.\n\nThe highest form of energy is when your mind is free of ideas, thoughts, or motives—just pure energy. You can’t chase it down or ask how to get it. To discover this energy, start by recognizing the daily energy you waste. This includes the energy spent talking, listening to nature, or observing the world around you. Everything you notice takes energy.\n\nYou gain physical energy from food and sunlight, which can be boosted by eating well. But the energy linked to your thoughts can become wasteful if it’s contradictory. \n\nListening to facts can actually free your mind. When someone shares something, just listen. That act of listening releases the tension around the fact. \n\nTake ambition, for example. We know what it does and how it affects us. An ambitious mind can’t truly empathize, feel pity, or love. It’s a cruel mindset. When you hear this, you might think, “How can I live in a world driven by ambition?” But by focusing on that thought, you miss the actual fact.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The highest form of energy arises from a state of mind free from thought and direction, which can be realized by understanding and observing the daily energy we waste."
