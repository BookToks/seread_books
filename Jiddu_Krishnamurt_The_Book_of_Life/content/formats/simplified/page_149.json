  "text": "There’s a real fear of pain. Physical pain is just our nerves reacting, but psychological pain hits when we cling to things that make us feel good. When we hold on tight, we start fearing anyone or anything that might take those things away. These mental baggage piles keep us from feeling pain as long as they stay untouched. So, I end up being a bundle of experiences, trying to avoid any serious disturbances. I’m scared of anything that shakes this up. My fear is tied to what I know—those physical or mental accumulations I’ve gathered to fend off pain or sorrow. \n\nKnowledge helps us dodge pain too. Just like medical knowledge can prevent physical pain, our beliefs can shield us from psychological pain. That’s why I fear losing my beliefs, even though I don’t have solid proof that they’re real.\n\n---\n\nOnly what dies can renew itself. \n\nWhen we talk about a spiritual entity, it’s something outside the mind’s reach. So, is the “I” a spiritual entity? If it is, it must exist beyond time, meaning it can’t be reborn or continued. Thought is all about time—it’s rooted in the past. If thought can contemplate the “I,” then that “I” is stuck in time and isn’t spiritual. The “I” is just a thought process, and you might wonder if that process can be reborn in a physical form. \n\nBut let’s dig deeper. Can anything that continues ever discover what’s real, beyond time and measurement? If the “I” is just a thought process, can it ever be new? If it can’t, then thought has to end. Anything that continues is destructive. Continuity doesn’t allow for renewal. As long as thought is tied to memory, desire, or experience, it can’t become something new. You could be reborn a thousand times, but you’d still miss the real deal. Only what dies, what comes to an end, can truly renew itself.\n\n---\n\nDo you know what it means to face death without arguing? Death doesn’t debate with you when it arrives. To meet it, you need to die every day—to your pain, your loneliness, those relationships you cling to. You have to let go of your thoughts, your habits, even your partner, so you can see them with fresh eyes. You must die to your society to become new and vibrant. You can’t face death if you’re not dying daily. It’s only in that dying that love emerges. A mind gripped by fear can’t love—it’s filled with habits and forced kindness. Fear leads to sorrow, and sorrow is just time wrapped up in thought.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Fear of psychological pain arises from attachment to accumulations and beliefs, which prevent renewal and true understanding of self."
