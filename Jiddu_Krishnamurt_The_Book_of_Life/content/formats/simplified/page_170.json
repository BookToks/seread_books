  "text": "There’s an amazing space in your mind, and that space is freedom. Don’t just sit around waiting for it to show up. Demand it from the start! Look for freedom in your work, your relationships, and everything you do. That’s when you’ll see that meditation is actually a form of creation. 🎨\n\nWe throw around the word \"creation\" a lot. A painter slaps some colors on a canvas and feels super proud. That’s how they express themselves, and they might even make some cash or gain fame from it—so they call it “creation.” Every writer claims to “create,” and there are even classes for “creative” writing. But honestly, that’s not true creation. It’s just how a conditioned mind responds to society. \n\nThe creation I’m talking about is way deeper. It’s a state of mind that’s in the act of creating. It might not always show itself, and that’s okay. The expression of it isn’t what matters. This state has no cause; it’s like a mind that’s constantly dying, living, loving, and just being. That’s the essence of meditation.\n\nA calm mind isn’t chasing any experiences. If it’s truly still and not influenced by the past, you’ll discover a movement of the unknown. This movement can’t be recognized or described in words. It’s something vast and timeless, where there’s no time, no space, and nothing to gain. This kind of mind understands true creation—not the kind of creation that comes from artists or poets, but a creation that’s pure, without motives or expressions. That’s where love and death come into play. \n\nFrom start to finish, this is what meditation is about. To meditate, you’ve got to know yourself. If you don’t, you won’t get very far. No matter how hard you try, you can only go as far as your own limited view, and that view is super close to you—it won’t take you anywhere new. Meditation is about laying that foundation right now and naturally finding that state of stillness. Only then can your mind go beyond time, experience, and knowing.\n\nIf you’ve really looked into what meditation is and understood how thinking works, you’ll notice your mind becomes completely still. In that stillness, there’s no one watching or observing, so there’s no experiencer. That means no self-centered mind trying to gather experiences. Don’t call this “samadhi”—that’s just a term you’ve read about.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** True meditation leads to a state of complete stillness and freedom, allowing for a profound understanding of creation beyond societal conditioning."
