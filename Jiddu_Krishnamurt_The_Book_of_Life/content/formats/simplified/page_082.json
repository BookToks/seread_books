  "text": "How do we get to a state of attention? You can't force it with persuasion, comparison, rewards, or punishments. That's just coercion. The first step is getting rid of fear. Fear sticks around as long as you're chasing success, which comes with its own frustrations and contradictions. You can teach someone to concentrate, but you can't teach them to pay attention, just like you can't teach someone to be free from fear. Understanding what causes fear helps eliminate it. \n\nAttention happens naturally when a student feels safe and secure, surrounded by a vibe of well-being. This sense of ease allows for genuine actions driven by love. Love doesn’t compare, so the envy and pain of “becoming” fade away. ❤️\n\nNow, can you practice humility? If you’re aware that you’re humble, then you’re not truly humble. Wanting to know if you’ve “arrived” shows you’re listening to achieve a specific state—a place where you won’t be disturbed and where happiness lasts forever. But here’s the truth: there’s no final destination. Life is all about the journey of learning, and that’s its beauty. If you think you’ve arrived, there’s nothing more to explore. \n\nMany of us want to feel accomplished in everything we do, which leads to dissatisfaction and frustration. Remember, there’s no end point; it’s just a continuous flow of learning. A mind that truly listens won’t seek results because it’s always evolving, like a river. 🌊 Such a mind doesn’t cling to a sense of self that’s chasing achievements.\n\nAwareness isn’t the same as knowledge. Awareness is about observing without judgment—just seeing things as they are. For example, if you look at a flower without getting lost in botanical details, you see the whole flower. But if your mind is filled with knowledge about it, you miss the bigger picture. \n\nTo truly observe something is to be aware. In that state, there’s no choice or judgment—no likes or dislikes. Yet, most of us struggle with this because we’re conditioned to see facts through a lens of background knowledge. We need to recognize our conditioning, which influences how we observe. Focus on the fact itself, not the background noise. 🌼\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Attention arises spontaneously in an atmosphere of well-being, free from fear and the urge to become."
