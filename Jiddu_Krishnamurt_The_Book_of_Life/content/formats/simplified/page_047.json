  "text": "One fear we all share is what others think of us. We worry about not achieving enough or missing out on opportunities. Alongside that, there's this heavy guilt—like we’ve done something wrong. We might be healthy while others struggle, or we have food when others don’t. The more we dig into these thoughts, the more guilt and anxiety creep in. \n\nFear often pushes us to seek out a Master or guru; it’s that need to be respectable that everyone craves. So, do you choose to be brave in facing life, or do you just make excuses to avoid fear? Do you distract yourself with music, books, or rituals? \n\nFear is a toxic force. It shrinks our minds, twists our thoughts, and leads to crazy theories, superstitions, and rigid beliefs. If you recognize fear as harmful, how do you clear it from your mind? You might think that figuring out why you’re scared will set you free. But does knowing the cause really make fear disappear? \n\nYou can’t just erase fear without understanding it. You need to see how time and thought work, which connects to language and memory. Is there any thought that isn’t tied to words? Without understanding your own mind and how it operates, saying you want to be free of fear doesn’t mean much. You have to look at fear in the context of your entire mind. \n\nTo truly see this, you need energy. But this isn’t just about eating well; it’s about mental energy. That energy gets wasted when you’re stuck in arguments, judgments, or opinions that block your vision. So, when you open your mind to this perception, you start to unlock new understanding. \n\nWhy do we obey or follow others? It’s because we’re scared of uncertainty. We crave certainty—financially, morally, and socially. We want approval and to avoid pain or trouble. Fear, whether we realize it or not, drives us to follow leaders, priests, or governments. It also keeps us from doing things that could hurt others, since we fear punishment. \n\nSo, behind all our actions and desires lies this need for certainty. Without addressing fear, merely obeying or being obeyed is meaningless. What truly matters is understanding how fear manifests in our lives every day.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Fear drives us to seek certainty and obedience, distorting our thoughts and actions."
