  "text": "Free yourself from the fake values that society has thrown at you. You need to strip it all away. That’s where you find immortality and reality. 🌟\n\nNovember 18  \nWhat’s the deal with reincarnation?  \n\nLet’s break down what reincarnation really means—not what you want to believe or what someone told you. Truth is what sets you free, not your opinions. When you say, “I’ll be reborn,” you need to figure out what “I” actually is. Is the “I” a spiritual being? Is it something that keeps going, independent of memory and experience? \n\nEither the “I” is a spiritual entity, or it’s just a thought process. It’s either timeless and spiritual (not bound by time) or stuck in time, memory, and thought. It can’t be anything else. So, let’s see if the “I” is truly spiritual. By “spiritual,” we mean something that can’t be conditioned or shaped by the human mind, something that doesn’t die. When we talk about a spiritual entity, we mean something outside the mind. \n\nSo, is the “I” a spiritual entity? If it is, it must be beyond time, which means it can’t be reborn or continued. Anything that continues can’t truly renew itself. As long as thought keeps going through memory, desire, and experience, it can’t know the real. \n\nNovember 19  \nIs there such a thing as a soul?  \n\nTo get a grip on death, we need to ditch the fear that creates all those theories about afterlife, immortality, or reincarnation. People in the East say there’s reincarnation—a constant cycle of rebirth, the so-called soul. Listen closely. \n\nIs there really a soul? We want to believe it exists because it makes us feel good. It seems eternal, spiritual, and unkillable, so our thoughts cling to it. But is the soul something beyond time and thought, something not made by humans? The mind sees chaos and uncertainty everywhere—nothing lasts. Your relationships, your job—nothing is permanent. So, the mind creates the idea of a permanent soul. \n\nBut if the mind can think about it, then it’s still stuck in the realm of time. If I can think about something, it’s part of my thought. And my thoughts come from time, experience, and knowledge. So, the soul is still caught in the timeline...\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The concept of the \"I\" and the soul is explored as potentially being a mere thought process conditioned by time, rather than a true spiritual entity beyond it."
