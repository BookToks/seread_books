  "text": "without hope or worrying about tomorrow. It’s not about being hopeless or indifferent. We’re not really living; we’re just chasing after death, the past, or the future. Living is the real revolution. Living has no set pattern, but death does: it’s all about what’s happened or some perfect future. If you’re living for that perfect future, you’re actually inviting death, not life. \n\nWhat’s true can only be found in the moment. It’s not a straight line. The mind, shaped by time, can only work within that time frame, so it can’t really grasp what’s true. \n\nTo understand your mind, you have to know it inside out. There’s no “I” separate from the mind. Just like a diamond’s qualities are part of the diamond itself, your mind’s qualities are part of it too. You can’t figure it out based on someone else’s ideas; you need to observe how your own mind works. When you see all of it—how it thinks, what it wants, its fears and desires—you can break free from it. That breakthrough leads to something totally new. This newness brings a fire, a passion that sparks a deep inward change. This change is what can truly transform the world, not any political or economic system.\n\nThere’s really only one state of being: consciousness. You might think of it as conscious and unconscious, but it’s all just consciousness. The catch? That consciousness is mostly about the past, never really about the now. You only realize what I’m saying a moment after I say it, right? You’re not aware of the present. \n\nIf you pay attention, you’ll see your mind is always swinging between the past and the future, with the present just being a bridge. Consciousness is a movement from the past to the future. \n\nWhen you observe your mind, you’ll notice it’s either escaping the present (which might be tough) by diving into the past or dreaming of the future as a way out. So, your mind gets stuck in the past or future and ignores the present. It either rejects what’s real or tries to cling to it. A mind like this can’t see facts as they are. That’s our conditioned state of consciousness. Our thoughts are just reactions shaped by the past. The more we respond based on those old beliefs, the more we reinforce the past. This reinforcement is what we mistakenly call the future.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Living authentically requires an inward revolution that transcends the conditioned mind's fixation on the past and future."
