  "text": "whole self. If you dive into it step by step, you'll find a real end to sorrow—not just a fake one that comes from running away or clinging to ideas. When that happens, you realize there's nothing to protect because your mind is clear and not trying to fill that emptiness. Once sorrow is truly gone, you're on a new journey—one with no start or finish. There’s a vastness beyond measure, but you can’t access it without fully letting go of sorrow. 🌌\n\n**Live with sorrow**\n\nWe all deal with sorrow, right? Want to understand it? You could analyze it, read books, or go to church, and you’d learn something. But that’s not what I mean. I’m talking about actually ending sorrow. Knowledge alone won’t cut it. To end sorrow, you have to face the psychological truths inside you and be aware of them moment by moment. This means no escaping, no rationalizing, and no opinions—just living with the reality of your sorrow. \n\nThink about it: living with the beauty of mountains without getting used to it is tough. You see those mountains, hear the stream, watch shadows move across the valley, day after day. It’s easy to take it for granted, right? You say, “Yeah, it’s beautiful,” and move on. Living with beauty—or even something ugly—without becoming numb takes serious energy. Awareness is key; otherwise, sorrow can dull your mind, and most of us let it. But you don’t have to just accept sorrow. You can live with it, understand it, and dive deep—not to learn more, but because it’s already a fact. You have to live. \n\n**Be in communion with sorrow**\n\nMost of us aren’t truly connected to anything—not our friends, partners, or kids. \n\nTo really understand sorrow, you need to embrace it. You have to be in direct connection with it. If you want to understand someone—like your neighbor or partner—you need to get close without any judgment or bias. You have to look at it directly. If I want to understand you, I can’t have prejudices clouding my view. I need to connect with you openly.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The true ending of sorrow requires living with it fully and understanding it without escape or rationalization."
