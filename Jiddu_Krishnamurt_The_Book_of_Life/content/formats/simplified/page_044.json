  "text": "By chasing security in relationships, you’re actually messing with their true purpose, which leads to some unique issues and bad vibes. \n\nThe real deal with relationships is that they show us who we really are. They’re all about self-discovery and getting to know yourself better. But this process can be tough. It requires constant tweaking and flexibility in how we think and feel. It's a struggle, but it can also bring moments of clarity and peace. \n\nMost of us try to dodge the tension that comes with relationships. We’d rather stick to the comfort of dependency, that easy security blanket. This makes family and other connections feel like a safe zone, but it’s a bit mindless. When insecurity sneaks into that dependency (and it will), we often ditch that relationship for a new one, hoping to find lasting security. But here’s the kicker: there’s no real security in relationships, and dependency just leads to fear. If we don’t grasp how security and fear work, relationships turn into chains that hold us back, keeping us in a cycle of struggle and pain. The only way out is through clear thinking, which comes from really knowing ourselves. \n\nMarch 17  \nHow can we experience real love? \n\nThe way you see a person—your partner, your leaders, even your kids—is just an image you’ve built up. That image comes from your experiences with them, your fears, and your hopes. The ups and downs of family life—pleasure, anger, comfort—create these images. You don’t see your partner; you see the image you’ve made of them. And guess what? They have an image of you too. So, the connection between you and your partner, or even a politician, is really just a clash of these two images. How can two images born from thoughts and feelings ever create real love? \n\nSo, whether you’re super close or miles apart, relationships are just a dance of images, symbols, and memories. And in that space, how can real love exist? \n\nMarch 18  \nWe are what we own. \n\nTo truly get relationships, we need to have a chill awareness that doesn’t ruin them. In fact, this kind of awareness makes relationships way more alive and meaningful. When we approach our connections this way, there’s a chance for genuine affection—a warmth and closeness that goes beyond just feelings. If we can apply this mindset to everything, our problems—like those around ownership and possessions—will start to sort themselves out. Because, at the end of the day, we are what we own. A person who has money? They become the money. Someone who identifies with their stuff? They are the stuff, the house, the furniture. The same goes for ideas.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Seeking security in relationships hinders their true function of self-revelation and understanding, leading to dependency and fear rather than genuine connection."
