  "text": "**Discontent Has No Answer**  \n\nWhat are we really discontent with? It’s all about what is. This \"what is\" could be the social scene, our relationships, or even ourselves—our messy thoughts, big dreams, frustrations, and endless fears. That’s who we are. We think if we run away from that, we’ll find an answer to our discontent. So, we’re always looking for ways to change what is—our minds get fixated on that.  \n\nIf I’m feeling discontent and want to find a path to contentment, my mind gets busy figuring out how to get there. I stop focusing on discontent itself—the burning anxiety we call discontent. Instead of digging into what’s behind that feeling, we just want to escape the heat of it.  \n\nThis is super tough because our minds are never satisfied. They always want to change what is into something else—this leads to condemnation, justification, or comparison. If you really pay attention, you’ll notice that when faced with what is, your mind condemns it, compares it to “how it should be,” or justifies it, pushing away what’s causing the pain and anxiety.  \n\n---\n\n**Effort Is Distraction from What Is**  \n\nWe need to get a grip on the issue of striving. If we understand what effort really means, we can apply it to our daily lives. Effort usually means struggling to change what is into what it isn’t or what it should be. We’re always trying to escape from what is to modify it.  \n\nTrue contentment comes from understanding what is, not from having a lot or a little. It’s about grasping the full meaning of what is. Only through passive awareness can we truly understand it. I’m not talking about physical struggles like building something or solving a tech issue; I mean the psychological battles we face. Those mental struggles always overshadow the physical ones. You can create a solid social structure, but if the psychological issues aren’t dealt with, they’ll eventually bring it all down.  \n\nEffort is just a distraction from what is. When we accept what is, striving stops. If you want to change or modify what is, you can’t truly accept it. Striving is a sign of destruction and sticks around as long as there’s a desire to change what is.  \n\n---\n\n**A Contentment Not of the Mind**  \n\nIsn’t discontent something we should embrace, not bury? We should dig into it and explore it. Only then, with a clear understanding of what is, can we find true contentment.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Discontent arises from our inability to accept and understand what is, leading us to seek change rather than explore the root of our dissatisfaction."
