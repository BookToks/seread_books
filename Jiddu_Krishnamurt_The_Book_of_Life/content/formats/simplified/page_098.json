  "text": "You hurt me, and I feel that pain. I hold onto that hurt, and it shapes how I see you. This is how our minds work every day. But what if I didnâ€™t let that hurt stick? What if I could meet you without that baggage? Thatâ€™s real growth. Itâ€™s about seeing things clearly, without being weighed down by past experiences.\n\nNow, letâ€™s talk about anger. Weâ€™ve all tried to push it away, but it doesnâ€™t just vanish. Anger can come from feeling blocked, insecure, or threatened. We know this feeling well. So how do we really understand and let go of anger? If you think your beliefs and opinions are everything, youâ€™ll react strongly when theyâ€™re challenged. But if you start questioning whether those beliefs are essential for understanding life, you can begin to let go of anger. This requires serious self-reflection. \n\nWhen you feel angry about injustice, ask yourself: Is it because you care about people? Can you be both angry and compassionate? Anger doesnâ€™t fix injustice; it usually makes things worse. To create real change, you need to act thoughtfully and with compassion. Anger only breeds more anger; it canâ€™t lead to true righteousness.\n\nNow, letâ€™s dive into compassion. Can a mind that gets hurt ever truly forgive? If youâ€™re always aware of your own pain, can you really be compassionate? True compassion isnâ€™t something the mind can grasp. When you consciously forgive, youâ€™re just reinforcing your own hurt. So, can you really be compassionate if youâ€™re stuck in that cycle? ðŸ¤”\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The accumulation of hurt influences our reactions, but true education allows us to meet others afresh without being conditioned by past experiences."
