  "text": "still the past, so our challenge is to change this cycle of the past without just creating another one.\n\n---\n\n**September 10**  \n**Why are we thoughtless?**  \n\nThinkers often just repeat their thoughts out of habit. This leads to ignorance and sadness. Isn’t habit a form of thoughtlessness? Being aware brings order, but it doesn’t create habits. Sticking to what we know makes us thoughtless. Why do we avoid thinking? Because it can hurt, cause chaos, and make us question our usual ways. Thinking deeply can take us to unfamiliar places, and our minds resist that. So, we stick to what we know, moving from one habit to another. A mind like this won’t let go of the familiar to find something new. Realizing that thinking can be painful, thinkers often become thoughtless by copying others and falling into habits. Out of fear of thinking, they create patterns of thoughtlessness. The thinker is afraid, and that fear shapes their actions. They look at their actions and try to change them, but the thinker is scared of their own creations. The thinker embodies fear itself; they are the source of ignorance and sorrow. Even if the thinker splits their thoughts into categories, it’s still the same thinker behind it all. The efforts to change or become something else only add to the conflict and confusion.\n\n---\n\n**September 11**  \n**The thinker is the thought**  \n\nWe need to understand the thinker, the doer, and the actor because their thoughts, deeds, and actions are all connected. The thinker is revealed through their thoughts. Their actions create their own misery and confusion. Think of a painter who creates a picture filled with fleeting happiness and sorrow. Why do they create such painful images? This is the issue we need to explore and resolve. Why does the thinker think these thoughts that lead to all their actions? This is the wall you keep hitting, right? If the thinker can rise above themselves, all conflict will stop. To rise above, they must know themselves. What’s understood and completed doesn’t repeat. It’s the repetition that keeps the thinker going.\n\n---\n\n**September 12**  \n**There is no freedom of thought**  \n\nIt might not be clear to everyone that we live in contradiction. We talk about peace but prepare for war. We preach nonviolence while being fundamentally violent. We claim to be good, yet we’re not. We speak of love, but we’re full of ambition and competition. This is where the contradiction lies.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The thinker is inherently linked to their thoughts and actions, creating a cycle of conflict and confusion that can only be resolved through self-understanding and transcendence."
