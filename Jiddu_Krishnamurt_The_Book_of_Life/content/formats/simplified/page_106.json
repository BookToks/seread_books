  "text": "Truth isn’t for those who want to fit in or chase after personal gains. If you’re looking for security or something permanent, you’re just running from the reality of change. People get stuck in the cycle of time, wanting something lasting, but that search isn’t real—it’s just a byproduct of their thoughts. \n\nTo find reality, you need to stop searching. This doesn’t mean settling for what is; instead, it requires a complete inner revolution. You can’t tie yourself to any class, nation, group, or belief system. Truth isn’t found in temples or churches, nor in anything created by humans. It emerges when you set aside all those mental and physical distractions. This letting go isn’t bound by time. Truth reveals itself to those who are free from the past and aren’t using time to build a self-image. Time is just a collection of memories—family, culture, experiences—that shape the “me” and “mine.” \n\n---\n\nYou might nod along when people say nationalism causes division and exploitation, but truly breaking free from that mindset is tough. To be free from nationalism and the limits of organized religions and political beliefs is crucial for keeping your mind fresh and revolutionary. Only such a mindset can spark real change—not the politicians stuck in their old ways or the priests trapped in their rituals. \n\nSo, whether you like it or not, you’ve come across something real. If you just listen without letting it challenge you, that truth can turn toxic. It’s like a wound that festers if ignored. To really grasp what’s true and false—and to see truth within the false—you need to let that truth work within you and inspire action. \n\n---\n\nUnderstanding the actual is simpler than it seems, though it can be a bit of a grind. We often don’t begin with what’s real or what we truly feel; we start with assumptions or ideals that aren’t based in reality, leading us off course. To focus on the facts, we need to pay close attention. Any thought that doesn’t stem from the actual is just noise. That’s why it’s essential to grasp what’s really happening inside and around you.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Truth cannot be discovered by those seeking security or belonging, but requires a revolutionary mindset free from all ideologies and attachments."
