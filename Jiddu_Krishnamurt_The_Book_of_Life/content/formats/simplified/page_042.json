  "text": "**March 11**  \n**Attachment is Escape**  \n\nBe aware of how you've been shaped by your experiences. You can only see it in relation to something else. You can't just think about it as a concept; that doesn't really mean anything. What we notice is conflict. Conflict happens when there's no harmony between a challenge and how we respond. This conflict comes from our conditioning. And that conditioning? It's all about attachment—attachment to work, traditions, stuff, people, ideas, you name it. If we weren’t attached, would we even have this conditioning? Nope. So why do we cling? I’m attached to my country because it gives me a sense of identity. I tie my worth to my job, my family, my possessions. These attachments help me escape from feeling empty inside. So, attachment is just another form of escape, and that escape only tightens our conditioning.  \n\n**March 12**  \n**To Be Alone**  \n\nBeing alone isn’t about feeling lonely; it’s a rebellion against society as a whole—every type of society, whether it’s capitalist, communist, or fascist. It’s about seeing how power operates. Have you seen those soldiers practicing? They’re not individuals anymore; they’ve turned into machines. They could be your kids or mine, standing there under the sun. This is happening everywhere—America, Russia, you name it. It’s not just at the government level; it’s in religious groups and organizations that wield incredible power. Only a mind that doesn’t belong can truly be alone. And being alone isn’t something you force. When you realize all this, you step outside of it all, and trust me, no politician is inviting you over for dinner. From that aloneness comes humility. This is where true love exists—not power. An ambitious person, whether they're religious or not, will never really know love. If you grasp this, you'll experience total living and action, which comes from knowing yourself.  \n\n**March 13**  \n**Craving is Always Craving**  \n\nTo dodge suffering, we try to detach. We know that attachment leads to pain, so we think we should become detached. Sure, attachment feels good, but when we see the hurt it brings, we want to find gratification another way—through detachment. But here’s the catch: as long as detachment gives us satisfaction, it’s just another form of attachment. What we’re really after is gratification; we crave to feel satisfied, no matter how we get it.  \n\nWe cling to things because they give us pleasure, security, power—a sense of feeling good, even if it comes with sorrow and fear. We seek detachment for the same reasons: to avoid pain and not get hurt inside. Ultimately, we’re just chasing pleasure and gratification.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Attachment serves as an escape from one's own emptiness, reinforcing conditioning and conflict."
