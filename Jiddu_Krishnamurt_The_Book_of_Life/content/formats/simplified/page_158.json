  "text": "The religious mindset isn’t tied to beliefs, priests, churches, or sacred texts. To really grasp what religion means, we need to first understand beauty. And to get that, we must experience total aloneness. Only when your mind is truly alone can it recognize beauty—nothing else works. \n\nAloneness isn’t about being isolated or unique. Being unique is just being different in some way. Real aloneness requires deep sensitivity, intelligence, and understanding. It means your mind is free from all outside influences, untouched by society. You need this state to explore if there’s something eternal, something beyond time.\n\n**December 3**  \n**Understanding Loneliness**  \n\nLoneliness and aloneness are worlds apart. You have to go through loneliness to reach true aloneness. They’re not even comparable. If you know loneliness, you can’t really know what it means to be alone. Are you in that state of aloneness? Our minds aren’t built for it. They tend to separate us, and that separation leads to loneliness.\n\nBut aloneness isn’t about separation. It’s not about being influenced by others or pieced together like our minds are. The mind is shaped by countless experiences and can never be truly alone. It can only recognize loneliness. When you’re aware of your loneliness, that’s when you can experience aloneness. That’s when you can access something immeasurable. Sadly, many of us crave dependency. We want friends and companions, which keeps us in conflict. True aloneness is free from conflict, but the mind struggles to see that; it only knows loneliness.\n\n**December 4**  \n**Innocence in Aloneness**  \n\nMost of us never experience real aloneness. You might isolate yourself in the mountains, but if you’re physically alone, your thoughts, experiences, and memories tag along. A Christian monk in a monastery isn’t truly alone; he’s surrounded by his ideas of Jesus and his beliefs. The same goes for a sannyasi in India—he’s not alone either, just carrying his memories.\n\nI’m talking about a state of aloneness where the mind is completely free from the past. Only in this state can you be virtuous, and it’s here that you find innocence. You might think...\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Aloneness, distinct from loneliness, is a state of mind free from societal influences and past conditioning, allowing for true understanding and innocence."
