  "text": "Thought comes from contradiction, which leads to frustration and more contradictions. \n\nHere’s the deal: all thought is partial. It can’t be complete. Thought is just memory responding, and memory is always limited because it comes from experience. So, every time you think, you're reacting based on your past. That means all your thinking, experiences, and knowledge are inherently incomplete. So, thought can’t solve our many problems. You might try to reason through them, but if you really look at your mind, you’ll see it’s shaped by your circumstances—like your culture, the food you eat, the climate you live in, the news you read, and the daily pressures you feel. \n\nWe need to get it straight: our thinking is just memory at work, and memory is mechanical. Knowledge is always partial, so all thought that comes from knowledge is limited. There’s no true freedom in thought. But we can start to find a kind of freedom that isn’t just about thinking. This freedom comes from being aware of all our conflicts and the influences around us. \n\n---\n\nNow, let’s talk about thinking without the thinker. \n\nImagine a monkey in a tree. It gets hungry, and then it feels the urge to grab some fruit. Action happens first, then the idea to store it. So, which comes first: action or the actor? Can you have an actor without action? Think about it: Who sees? Who watches? Is the thinker separate from their thoughts? The observer separate from what they observe? The experiencer separate from the experience? The actor separate from the action? \n\nIf you look closely, you’ll see action comes first. When action has a goal, it creates the actor. If your thinking is clear, free of bias or the need to convince anyone, and you’re not aiming for a specific outcome, then there’s no thinker—just the thinking itself. It’s only when you chase an end that the thinker feels important, not the thought. Some of you might have noticed this. It’s crucial to understand because it shows us how to act. \n\nIf the thinker comes first, then they’re more important than thought. This is how many philosophies and customs of today’s world work. But if thought comes first, then thought matters more than the thinker. \n\n---\n\nLastly, let’s talk about immediate perception. \n\nFor me, perception is key. It’s about seeing what’s true or false right away. This immediate understanding is what really matters—not the intellect with its tricks, knowledge, or commitments.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** All thought is partial and conditioned by experience, limiting true freedom and understanding."
