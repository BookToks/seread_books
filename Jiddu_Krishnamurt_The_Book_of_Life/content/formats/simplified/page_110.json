  "text": "Thought is just feelings turned into words. It’s how we remember stuff—words, experiences, images. But here’s the catch: thought is always changing and temporary, even though it craves something permanent. So, thought creates the thinker, who tries to be that permanent thing. This thinker becomes the judge, the guide, the one in control. But this so-called permanent self is just a trick of thought—without thought, it doesn’t exist. The thinker is made up of traits, and those traits are inseparable from who they are. The one in control is also the one being controlled; it’s just a game they’re playing with themselves. Until we see the false as false, we can’t find the truth.\n\nNow, how do we merge the thinker with their thoughts? Not through willpower, discipline, or any effort. Using a method means there’s someone acting, right? As long as there’s an actor, there’s a split. True fusion happens only when the mind is completely still, without trying to be. This stillness comes when thought itself stops, not when the thinker disappears. We need to break free from conditioned responses, which are just thoughts. Each problem gets solved only when ideas and conclusions fade away—those are just distractions. How can we understand anything when our minds are all over the place? \n\nYou’ve got to mix seriousness with spontaneity. If you’ve been paying attention, you’ll notice that truth often pops up when you least expect it. So, stay open and aware of each moment. Don’t box yourself in with rigid thoughts. The joy of truth shines through when your mind isn’t caught up in its own chaos.\n\nSpace is key. Without space, there’s no freedom. We’re talking about the mind here. When there’s no gap between the observer and what they’re observing, like a tree, that’s when you’re truly connected. You’re not identifying with the tree, the flower, or anyone else. When that space disappears, you find a vastness where there’s no conflict and true freedom exists.\n\nFreedom isn’t just a reaction. You can’t claim, “I’m free.” The moment you say that, you’re aware of being free from something, which creates a divide—like the observer looking at a tree. That creates space and conflict. Understanding this isn’t about agreeing or disagreeing; it’s about directly experiencing what is. It means realizing that every action is tied to both the observer and the observed. Within that space, there’s pleasure, pain, and the desire to achieve or be recognized. But in that space, there’s no real connection. True contact and relationship have a different meaning altogether.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Thought creates a false sense of permanence and division between the thinker and thoughts, which must be transcended to achieve true understanding and freedom."
