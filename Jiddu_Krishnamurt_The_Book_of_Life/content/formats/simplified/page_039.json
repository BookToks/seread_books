  "text": "Why does the mind freak out about being alone? Does it even know what that feels like? As long as you don’t really get or face that loneliness—whatever word you want to use—it sticks around. And if loneliness sticks around, you’ll always depend on others. You can’t find out what’s true or what real religion is if you’re stuck in that cycle.\n\n**March 4**  \nGet super aware.  \n\nDependence kicks off a cycle of detachment and attachment, leading to constant conflict without understanding or a way out. You need to notice how attachment and dependence work—do it without judging yourself. When you do this, you’ll start to see why this conflict exists. If you become deeply aware and focus on understanding your needs and dependencies, your mind will clear up about it. Then, your subconscious—where all your hidden motives and desires hang out—will start to show itself to your conscious mind. \n\nWhen this happens, pay attention to what your subconscious is trying to tell you. If you keep doing this, even while thinking about other stuff, your conscious and subconscious will work together to solve the problem of dependence or whatever else is bugging you. This creates a steady awareness that will help you integrate everything. And if you’re taking care of your health and diet, this will lead to a fuller life.  \n\n**March 5**  \nRelationships.  \n\nRelationships built on mutual need just create conflict. Even if we rely on each other, we’re often just using one another for our own goals. When there’s an end goal, real connection fades away. You might use me, and I might use you. In that usage, we lose touch. A society built on using each other is a recipe for violence. When we use someone, we’re only focused on what we can gain. That focus on the end goal blocks real connection and communion. Even if using someone feels good, there’s always fear lurking underneath. To dodge that fear, we feel the need to possess. But that possession breeds envy, suspicion, and ongoing conflict. Such relationships can’t bring true happiness.  \n\nA society that runs on mere need—whether physical or psychological—will only create conflict, confusion, and misery. Society is just a reflection of you interacting with others, where need and usage take center stage. When you use someone to fulfill your needs, whether it's physical or emotional, there’s no real relationship. It’s like treating the other person as just furniture, there for your convenience. So, it’s crucial to grasp what relationships mean in everyday life.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Understanding the nature of dependence and attachment is crucial for achieving true freedom and meaningful relationships."
