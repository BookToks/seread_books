  "text": "When we name what we experience, see, or feel, those words become super important. Words are tied to time and space; they’re at the center of our thoughts. But can your mind be free of words? Instead of asking, “How can I be free?” (which doesn’t help), ask yourself how much you’re stuck on labels like India, Gita, communism, Christian, Russian, American, or even social classes. Think about words like love, God, or meditation. We’ve given these words so much power, and we’re chained to them. 🗝️\n\nAre you just thinking about things, or are you really experiencing them? Do you know what a religious mind is? From what you’ve said, it seems unclear. You might get a brief glimpse, like seeing a clear blue sky when clouds part. But once you notice the blue, you start to remember it and crave it. That desire pulls you away from the actual experience. \n\nCan you think without words? When your mind isn’t filled with them, thinking becomes something different—an activity without limits. Words create boundaries. A mind that operates beyond words has no limits; it’s unbound. Take the word love, for instance. Just mentioning it can make you smile, but it also stirs up all sorts of ideas and divisions: carnal, spiritual, profane, infinite, and so on. To truly understand love, you need to let go of the word and its weight.\n\nTo really connect with each other, we have to avoid getting stuck in words. A word like God might mean something totally different to you than it does to me. Communication gets tricky unless we both aim to understand each other beyond just the words. The term freedom usually means being free from something—greed, envy, nationalism, anger, etc. But freedom can also mean simply feeling free. Understanding this deeper meaning is key. 🌟\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Words create limitations in understanding and experiencing reality, making it essential to go beyond them for true comprehension."
