  "text": "People chase happiness for themselves, their families, and society. But if something stops them, they feel unhappy. We're not saying that those who are poor shouldn't get what they wantâ€”that's not the point. We need to figure out what happiness really is and if weâ€™re even aware of it. \n\nThe moment you realize youâ€™re happy, is that true happiness? When youâ€™re aware of your happiness, it slips away. Itâ€™s like humility: if you know you're humble, you probably aren't. Happiness isnâ€™t something to chase. If you pursue it, itâ€™ll just run away. ðŸŒŸ\n\nHappiness isnâ€™t a sensation. Your mind canâ€™t find it. You can chase sensationsâ€”those fleeting feelingsâ€”but happiness isnâ€™t something you can grasp. Remembering happiness is just a reaction to the past. Whatâ€™s gone isnâ€™t true happiness; itâ€™s just a memory. \n\nWhat you know is history, not the now, and that history is just sensations and memories. Can the past really define happiness? It can recall it, but it canâ€™t live it. Knowing what happiness is doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re experiencing it. Recognition comes from memory, and memory canâ€™t bring happiness. \n\nWhen youâ€™re aware of your happiness, is there even happiness? When you're truly happy, you donâ€™t need to think about it. Awareness comes from conflict; it's about wanting more. But happiness isnâ€™t about wanting. Where thereâ€™s conflict, happiness canâ€™t exist. Thought, driven by memory, creates conflict. Thoughts are sensations, and sensations arenâ€™t happiness. They just crave gratification. Remember, happiness isnâ€™t an end goal; you canâ€™t just hunt it down. \n\nWe often look for happiness in things, relationships, and ideas. When we do that, those things become more important than happiness itself. This makes the issue seem simpleâ€”and it is. If you seek happiness in possessions, family, or status, those things take over. Then, happiness gets lost in the chase. Can you find happiness through anything you create or think about? Everything we chase is temporary. Things wear out, relationships can be tough, and ideas are unstable. This constant search only leads to unhappiness.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Happiness cannot be pursued or found through external means, as it is a by-product of self-awareness and cannot exist alongside conflict or memory."
