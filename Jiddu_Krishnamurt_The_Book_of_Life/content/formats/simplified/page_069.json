  "text": "When you see a group of people, focus on each face instead of treating them like a crowd. This makes you more aware, observant, and understanding. You develop a deeper sense of empathy and love. But if you see them as just a mass, you miss out.\n\nIf you don’t label your feelings, you have to face each one as it comes. When you label a feeling, does it change? Or does the label just trigger the feeling? \n\nWithout names or words, your mind isn’t just observing. When you stop thinking in labels or images, you lose the separation between the thinker and the thought. That’s when your mind becomes truly quiet. And in that quiet, you can deal with feelings as they arise. It’s when you name them that they stick around, building up in your mind as you keep adding more labels.\n\n**May 14**  \nStay with a feeling and see what happens. \n\nYou rarely sit with a feeling as it is; you always wrap it in words. Those words twist it up, and your thoughts can overwhelm it with fears and desires. You don’t just experience hate or beauty; you label them and struggle with the labels. \n\nTry to sit with feelings like hate, envy, or ambition. This is what you deal with daily, even if you wish to live with love. When hate or the urge to hurt someone arises, can you just sit with that feeling? Have you even tried? You’ll find it tough. Your mind won’t let it be; it’ll flood you with memories, rules, and endless chatter. \n\nPick up a shell. Can you admire its beauty without calling it pretty or wondering about its origin? Can you just experience it without your mind jumping in? If you can, you might discover something amazing—an experience that goes beyond time, a spring that doesn’t need summer. \n\n**May 15**  \nThink about how you use words. It’s a wild process to name things. If you’ve explored this, you’ll find it’s truly astonishing.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Remaining with a feeling without labeling it allows for a deeper understanding and experience of that feeling."
