  "text": "**September**\n\n**September 1**  \nWe think we’re intellectual.  \n\nA lot of us believe we’re smart because we’ve read tons of books filled with other people’s ideas. We think quoting famous authors makes us intellectual. But really, how many of us have original thoughts? After focusing so much on intellect, we often lose touch with our feelings. Now, we face the challenge of balancing our lives. We need to develop our reasoning skills and see things as they truly are—not just spouting opinions on theories. It’s about thinking for ourselves and recognizing what’s real versus what’s not. This is one of our big struggles: being unable to see not just the world around us, but also our own inner lives—if we even have one.  \n\n**September 2**  \nAll thought is distraction.  \n\nA competitive mind, caught up in comparison and conflict, can’t discover what’s real. But when we’re deeply aware, we engage in self-discovery, which is freeing and creative. This process helps us break free from wanting more and from the complicated life of the intellect. That complex life often leads to addictions—like destructive curiosity, gossip, or just chasing knowledge—which complicate our lives. Sure, having a focus sharpens our minds, but it doesn’t help us connect with reality.  \n\nGetting rid of distractions is tough because we don’t fully grasp how our thinking can distract us. Our minds are always curious and speculative, which can create illusions that block us from seeing what’s real. So, our minds end up being their own worst enemies. To break free from these self-created distractions, we need to understand this power. The mind has to be completely still and silent, as all thought can become a distraction.  \n\n**September 3**  \nUnity of mind and heart.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Most people mistake their extensive reading and intellectual abilities for true intelligence, losing the capacity for original thought and balance in their lives."
