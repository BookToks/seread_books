  "text": "it twists and turns, always lurking. You can try to ignore it, escape it, or embrace itâ€”it's still there. Some spiritual teachers say we should be free from desire, which is pretty ridiculous. Desire needs to be understood, not crushed. Destroying desire could mean destroying life itself. If you twist, control, or suppress desire, you might ruin something incredibly beautiful. ðŸŒŸ\n\n**April 4**  \n**The quality of desire**  \n\nWhat if you stopped judging desire as good or bad and just noticed it? Do you know what it means to really be aware? Most of us arenâ€™t, because weâ€™re too busy labeling and choosing. Making choices creates conflict, which blocks awareness. Imagine stepping into a room and seeing everythingâ€”the furniture, the carpetâ€”just as it is, without judging. Itâ€™s tough, right? Have you ever tried looking at a person, a flower, or an emotion without any judgment? \n\nIf you can approach desire like thatâ€”living with it instead of pushing it away or labeling it as ugly or chaoticâ€”does it still cause turmoil? Is desire something to destroy? We want to eliminate it because one desire clashes with another, creating conflict and misery. But can we be aware of the whole experience of desire? By \"whole,\" I mean not just one desire or many, but the essence of desire itself. \n\n**April 5**  \n**Why shouldnâ€™t one have pleasure?**  \n\nWhen you see a stunning sunset, a beautiful tree, or a flowing river, it feels amazing. Whatâ€™s wrong with enjoying that? The trouble starts when we cling to those memories, wanting to relive them. We all know this feeling. Whether itâ€™s a moment of joy, a great meal, or a fun night out, we crave the repeat. Thatâ€™s when pleasure can cloud our judgment and create false values. \n\nItâ€™s crucial to understand pleasure instead of trying to eliminate itâ€”thatâ€™s just silly. No one can get rid of pleasure. Instead, grasp the nature of pleasure. If life is all about chasing pleasure, then it can become a trap.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Desire should be understood rather than destroyed, as it is an intrinsic part of life that can lead to conflict if not properly acknowledged."
