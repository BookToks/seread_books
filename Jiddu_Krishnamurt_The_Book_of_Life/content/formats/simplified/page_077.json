This is key to grasp because as long as your mind is busy breaking one habit and accidentally creating another, it can never be truly free. Only a free mind can see beyond itself. \n\n---\n\n**Energy Creates Its Own Discipline**\n\nChasing reality takes a ton of energy. If you’re not doing that, you’re wasting your energy on stuff that causes problems, which is why society tries to control you. But can you free your energy while searching for God or truth and still be someone who gets life’s big issues—and isn’t easily crushed by society? \n\nRemember, humans are energy. If you’re not seeking truth, that energy can turn destructive. That’s when society steps in and tries to mold you, stifling your energy. But here’s something cool: when you really want to do something, suddenly you have the energy to make it happen. That energy can actually help you control yourself, so you don’t need outside rules. In the quest for reality, energy creates its own discipline. A person seeking truth naturally becomes a good citizen—not just following any society’s rules.\n\n---\n\n**Duality Creates Conflict**\n\nAny kind of conflict—whether physical, mental, or emotional—is just energy down the drain. This is tough to grasp because we’re raised to struggle and put in effort. In school, we learn to try hard. That mindset sticks with us: to be good, you have to fight against evil, resist, and control. \n\nWe’re taught, through education, society, and religion, that finding God means working hard, torturing your mind and body, denying your desires, and constantly battling at what’s supposed to be a spiritual level—when it’s really not spiritual at all. Plus, socially, everyone’s just looking out for themselves or their family. \n\nSo, we’re wasting energy everywhere. This waste is essentially conflict: the tug-of-war between “I should” and “I shouldn’t,” “I must” and “I must not.” Once you create this duality, conflict is unavoidable. Understanding this whole duality process is crucial—not that there aren’t differences like man and woman, green and red, light and dark, tall and short.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A free mind, liberated from conditioning and conflict, can perceive deeper truths and create its own discipline in the pursuit of reality."
