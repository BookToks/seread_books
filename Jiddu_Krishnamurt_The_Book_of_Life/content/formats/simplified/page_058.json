  "text": "To love is to be chaste. \n\nThe whole sex thing isn’t simple. You can’t just tackle it on its own level. Trying to fix it just by looking at biology? That’s ridiculous. Approaching it through religion or viewing it as just physical adjustments or rules? That’s immature and honestly, kinda silly. This issue needs serious intelligence. Understanding ourselves in relationships requires way more insight than just figuring out nature. But we want quick fixes, immediate answers, and that just makes the problem bigger.\n\nLove isn’t just a thought. Thoughts are just surface-level brain stuff. Love runs deeper, way deeper. You can only find the real meaning of life through love. Without it, life feels empty, and that’s the sad truth. We age but often stay emotionally immature. Our bodies might change, but our minds can remain thoughtless. Reading about love or talking about it doesn’t mean we’ve felt its warmth. Without that love, no matter what laws we make or groups we join, we won’t solve the problem. To truly love is to be chaste. Just using your intellect doesn’t equal chastity. If you’re trying to be chaste in thought without love, you’re missing the point. Only those who truly love are pure and incorruptible.\n\n---\n\nConstant thought is a waste of energy. \n\nMost of us spend our lives struggling and putting in effort. That struggle? It just drains our energy. Throughout history, people have said that to find reality or God—whatever you call it—you must be celibate. That means taking a vow of chastity and fighting against your desires your whole life. Think about the energy wasted there! Indulging is also a waste, but suppressing your desires is even worse. That suppression distorts your mind and creates a harsh, austere outlook. \n\nSeriously, pay attention to yourself and those around you. Notice how much energy is wasted in this constant battle. It’s not just about the act of sex; it’s the ideals, the images, the endless thoughts about pleasure. That’s all energy down the drain. Most people waste their energy by either denying their desires, sticking to a vow of chastity, or obsessively thinking about it.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Chastity is rooted in love, and understanding the complexities of love requires profound intelligence beyond mere biological or religious perspectives."
