  "text": "Is what we think of as real really real? Not really. The second you try to describe something that can't be put into words, it stops being real. When you turn the unknown into something known, it loses its mystery. But we keep chasing after that knowledge. Why? Because we think knowing will bring us happiness and stability. We want answers because we’re not happy; we’re struggling, exhausted, and feeling low. Instead of facing the truth—that we’re worn out and in chaos—we try to escape from what we know into the unknown, which just becomes more known, and we still can’t find what’s real.\n\n---\n\nIs suffering just a word or something real? If it’s real, then the word means nothing. What’s left is just the feeling of pain. Pain relates to something—an image, an experience, something you have or don’t have. If you have it, it’s pleasure; if you don’t, it’s pain. So, is that something just talk, or is it real? Fear can’t exist alone; it’s always tied to something—someone, an event, a feeling. Now that you’re aware of your suffering, is it separate from you, making you just an observer, or is that suffering part of you?\n\n---\n\nYou are nothing. You might have a name, a job, money, or fame, but despite all that, you’re still nothing. You might not even realize this emptiness, or you might not want to face it, but it’s there no matter what. You can try to escape it through violence, worship, knowledge, or distractions, but whether you’re awake or asleep, it’s always present. You can only confront this nothingness and the fear it brings by being fully aware of your attempts to escape it. You’re not separate from it; you’re not just an observer. You and nothingness are connected; they’re not two different things. If you fear it and see it as something outside of you, any action you take will lead to confusion and more misery. When you realize that nothingness is part of you, fear disappears, as it only exists when the thinker feels separate from their thoughts.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The pursuit of knowledge and understanding often leads to a cycle of suffering and illusion, as true reality cannot be captured or described."
