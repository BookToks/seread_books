  "text": "Words matter. Discovering truth or God takes serious smarts—not just believing or doubting, but seeing what blocks you. To find God or truth (which I believe exists), your mind needs to be free from all the barriers built over time for safety and comfort. You can’t just claim you’re free; you have to break through those walls. \n\nReal intelligence is more than just smarts; it’s about syncing your mind and heart. When you achieve that, you’ll uncover reality for yourself—no need to ask anyone else. \n\n---\n\nWithout meditation, you can't know yourself. And without self-knowledge, meditation won't work. You need to start with who you are. You can't get far without understanding your daily thoughts, feelings, and actions. \n\nThought needs to recognize how it operates. You’ll notice that thought only moves from what you already know. The unknown? That’s a whole different ball game. What you know isn’t the real deal; it’s just tied to time. \n\nThe key is to break free from time, not to just ponder the unknown. Answers to your prayers come from what you already know. To access the unknown, your mind has to become unknown itself. \n\nYour mind is shaped by your thoughts and time. For real growth, this thought process needs to stop. You can’t think about what’s eternal or timeless, so your mind has to let go of time. Only when you’re free from yesterday—without using the present to chase the future—can you embrace the eternal. \n\nIn meditation, the goal is to know yourself deeply, not just on the surface. You need to explore your inner consciousness and shed its conditioning. If you don’t do that, you can’t push past your mind's limits. That’s why stopping the thought process is crucial, and to do that, you need self-awareness. \n\nMeditation is where wisdom begins—it’s all about understanding your own mind and heart. \n\n---\n\nI’m diving into what meditation is step by step. Don’t wait for a perfect guide; what we’re discussing now is part of it. \n\nYou need to be aware of the thinker—not just try to fix the conflict between thought and the thinker. The thinker is that part of you that collects experiences as knowledge. It’s bound by time and influenced by everything around you. From this spot, you look, listen, and experience life.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To discover truth or God, one must free the mind from hindrances created by self-protection and security, requiring a harmony of intelligence and self-knowledge through meditation."
