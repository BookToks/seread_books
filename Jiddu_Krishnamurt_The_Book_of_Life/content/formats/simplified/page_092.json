  "text": "We chase happiness in things that don’t last, and that’s why sorrow sticks around. Figuring out what true happiness means means diving into self-knowledge. But remember, self-knowledge isn’t the final goal. Think of it like a river: every drop counts, and happiness isn’t found at the source. It’s discovered where you are on that journey. 🌊\n\n---\n\nHappiness isn’t just a mental game. We keep moving from one thing to another, seeking more joy. But at the core, there’s “the me”—the one who craves happiness, who struggles, who refines itself but never wants to stop. True bliss happens when “the me” fades away. That’s when you find joy that doesn’t come with pain or corruption. \n\nWhen we let go of the need for “the me,” there’s a shot at happiness that’s unshakeable. It won’t be permanent in the way we usually think about it, but our minds are always chasing that lasting happiness. That desire for something permanent? That’s where corruption creeps in. \n\nIf we can look at life without judging it as right or wrong, we might discover a creative happiness that isn’t just “yours” or “mine.” It’s like sunshine: if you try to hoard it, it loses its warmth. Wanting happiness because you’re suffering or because you’ve lost something? That’s just a reaction. When the mind rises above that, real happiness emerges—one that’s not tied to thoughts. ☀️\n\n---\n\nNow, why do we even ask, “What is happiness?” Is that the right question? If we were truly happy, our world would look way different. Our culture would be transformed. Instead, we’re stuck in unhappiness—petty, miserable, and chasing after pointless things. We surround ourselves with material stuff, chasing money and status, but we still feel empty. Even with knowledge or wealth, we’re suffering. That suffering drives us to seek happiness, leading us to those who promise it through social, economic, or spiritual means. 🌀\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** True happiness is found beyond the self and the pursuit of personal desires, emerging from a deeper understanding of life and suffering."
