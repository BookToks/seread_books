  "text": "**December 13**  \n**Is there truth in religions?**  \n\nSo, is there any real truth in religions, theories, ideals, or beliefs? Let‚Äôs break it down. What do we mean by religion? Definitely not organized religion like Hinduism, Buddhism, or Christianity. These are just structured beliefs filled with propaganda, conversion efforts, and pressure. \n\nOrganized religion might claim to hold truth, but it‚Äôs not true in itself. It actually divides us. You‚Äôre a Muslim, I‚Äôm a Hindu, someone else is a Christian or a Buddhist‚Äî and look at us, arguing and even fighting. Is that true? \n\nWe‚Äôre not here to debate the pursuit of truth in religion; we‚Äôre questioning if organized religion itself has any truth. We‚Äôve been conditioned to think that labeling ourselves as Hindu or something else makes us special or helps us find God. That‚Äôs just silly. To find God or truth, you need virtue. Virtue means freedom, and you can only discover truth when you‚Äôre free, not trapped by organized beliefs. \n\nAnd what about theories, ideals, and beliefs? Why do we hold onto beliefs? Because they give us security and comfort. They help us feel safe. But in doing so, we create ideals that stop us from seeing reality. Those ideals can actually block us from taking action.  \n\n**December 14**  \n**To climb high, one must begin low**  \n\nReligious organizations can become as rigid as the thoughts of their members. Life is always changing and evolving, but organizations can‚Äôt keep up. They resist change to protect themselves, becoming reactionary. The quest for truth is personal, not something you find in a group. To connect with what‚Äôs real, you need to be alone‚Äî not isolated, but free from outside influences and opinions. \n\nThink about it: the desire for power in spiritual organizations is endless. They hide their greed behind fancy words, but underneath, it‚Äôs all about avarice, pride, and conflict. This leads to intolerance and division. \n\nWouldn‚Äôt it be smarter to have small, informed groups of about twenty-five people? No fees or memberships‚Äîjust casual meet-ups to talk about reality. To keep it inclusive, members could occasionally join other small groups. This way, it stays broad and open-minded, not narrow and exclusive. \n\nTo climb high, you‚Äôve got to start low. From these small beginnings, we can help create a happier, more sane world. üåç\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Organized religion is false and hinders the pursuit of truth, separating individuals and fostering conflict rather than understanding."
