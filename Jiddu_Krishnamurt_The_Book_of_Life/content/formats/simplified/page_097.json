  "text": "Why do we label problems as major or minor? Aren't all problems just problems? Why categorize them as essential or unessential? If we really dive into one problem—no matter how big or small—we can uncover the essence of all problems. This isn’t just talk. \n\nTake anger, for example. We all know it well. If you dig deep into anger, what do you find? It often comes from feeling hurt or being insulted. When someone flatters you, you feel good. But why do you feel hurt? It usually ties back to self-importance, right? \n\nAnd why do we have this self-importance? Because we create an image of ourselves—who we think we should be versus who we actually are. We chase ideals, heroes, and examples. Anger flares up when our self-image gets attacked. That image is our escape from reality. \n\nWhen you see yourself as you truly are, no one can hurt you. If you’re a liar and someone points it out, you won’t feel hurt; it’s just a fact. But if you pretend you’re not a liar and someone calls you out, then you get angry. We often live in a world of ideas and myths instead of facing the truth. To truly observe what is, you need to drop judgment, evaluations, opinions, and fear. \n\nNow, let’s talk about sadism. Ever heard of it? It comes from the Marquis de Sade, who wrote about people who get pleasure from hurting others. Some folks find satisfaction in seeing others suffer. Pay attention to yourself—do you feel that way? It might not be obvious, but maybe you laugh when someone trips. \n\nWe often want to see those above us fall and gossip about others, which shows a lack of empathy. You might hurt someone on purpose or even without realizing it—through words, gestures, or looks. In either case, there’s an urge to hurt, and very few people truly set aside this twisted pleasure. \n\nFinally, let’s touch on education. Our minds are shaped by experiences, memories, and traditions. But can we free our minds from just storing this info while still experiencing life? It’s about breaking free from the habit of accumulating thoughts and memories.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Understanding any problem deeply reveals the interconnectedness of all issues, as they stem from our self-image and reactions to reality."
