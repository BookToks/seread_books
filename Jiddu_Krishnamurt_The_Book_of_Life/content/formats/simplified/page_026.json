  "text": "struggling to be nonviolent is just chasing an ideal. But that ideal is really just a rebranded version of what’s already happening. \n\nWhen you realize this trick your mind plays on you, you start to see the false for what it really is. Chasing after illusions only leads to more conflict and breaks you down. Awareness of this trick means you can just focus on what is real. When you let go of striving for ideals, comparisons, and judgments, your mind’s structure falls apart, and what is transforms completely. As long as you label what is, you’re stuck in a relationship with it. But when you stop naming things—thanks to memory, which is how your mind works—what is ceases to exist. True integration happens only in this transformation. \n\n---\n\nCan a crude mind become sensitive? \n\nThink about the question. If I say my mind is crude and I try to become sensitive, that effort is just more crudity. Notice this. Instead of trying to change, recognize your crudeness. Observe it in your daily life—the way you eat, how you treat others, your pride and arrogance. Just noticing these things can change your reality. \n\nThe same goes for being stupid. If I say I need to be intelligent, that effort is just a deeper form of stupidity. What matters is understanding my stupidity. No matter how much I try to be smart, I can still be stupid. I might know quotes or facts, but if I don’t see how my stupidity shows up—like how I treat people around me—that awareness can break down my ignorance. \n\n---\n\nOpportunities for self-expansion \n\nHierarchical structures can seem like a chance for growth. You might want brotherhood, but how can that exist if you’re chasing spiritual status? You might laugh at worldly titles, but if you accept the Master or guru in the spiritual world, aren’t you just bringing that same mindset into spirituality? \n\nCan there be levels in spiritual growth or understanding of truth? Love doesn’t have divisions. You either love or you don’t. Don’t drag out the process of getting to love. When you realize you don’t love, and you’re fully aware of that, you open the door to change. But if you keep separating the Master from the student, or the enlightened from the unenlightened, you miss the point.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The struggle to achieve ideals and self-improvement often perpetuates disintegration, while true transformation arises from awareness and understanding of one's current state."
