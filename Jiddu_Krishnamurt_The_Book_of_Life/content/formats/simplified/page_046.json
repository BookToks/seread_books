  "text": "We often try to escape our loneliness and its scary feelings by clinging to others. We think companionship will fill the void. But in this game, we’re the players, and others become our pawns. When they start asking for something in return, we’re caught off guard and upset. If we build a strong personal fortress, outside pressures won’t bother us much. \n\nAs we age, we need to understand and fix our tendencies before they take over. We should observe our fears and understand them now. Instead of just focusing on external pressures, we need to dive deep into ourselves—our loneliness, fears, and weaknesses.\n\nLiving alone isn’t really a thing; all living is about relationships. But if you want to live without direct connections, you need sharp intelligence and awareness for self-discovery. A “lone” life without this awareness only strengthens negative habits and creates imbalance. Now’s the time to notice and understand these habits of thought and feeling that come with age, so we can let them go. True peace and joy come from inner richness. ✨\n\n---\n\n**Freedom from Fear**\n\nCan our minds really be free of fear? Fear creates illusions and dulls our thinking. Where there’s fear, there’s no freedom, and without freedom, there’s no love. Most of us carry some fear—fear of darkness, judgment, snakes, pain, aging, and death. We have a ton of fears. But can we truly be free of them?\n\nFear impacts us deeply. It leads to lies, corruption, and shallow thinking. There are dark corners in our minds that we can’t face as long as we’re afraid. It’s normal to protect ourselves from physical dangers, like a snake or a cliff. But I’m talking about the psychological fears—like fear of illness, death, or enemies. \n\nWhenever we seek fulfillment—be it through art, music, or relationships—fear is lurking. What matters is being aware of this whole process. We need to observe and learn about ourselves instead of just trying to escape fear. If your goal is just to get rid of fear, you’ll only find ways to run from it, and that means you’ll never truly be free. 🌱\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** We depend on others to escape our loneliness and fears, but true understanding of ourselves is essential for inner peace and freedom from fear."
