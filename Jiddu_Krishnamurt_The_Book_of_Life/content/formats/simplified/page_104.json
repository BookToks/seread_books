  "text": "**August 1**  \n**Full heart, empty mind**  \n\nTruth doesn’t come from a path; it shows up when you're ready. It arrives only when your mind is clear and your heart is full of love—not cluttered with thoughts. When you truly love, you stop talking about organizing for brotherhood or dividing people. You don’t need to seek reconciliation. You just exist as a human being, free of labels or nationalities. \n\nTo welcome truth, you have to strip away all those distractions and let it emerge. It shows up when your mind is empty and quiet, not when you’re actively searching for it. Truth comes like a breeze—unexpected and subtle. It’s as sudden as sunlight and as pure as a starry night. But to receive it, your heart needs to be full, and your mind empty. Right now, though, your mind is packed, and your heart feels empty.  \n\n**August 2**  \n**Truth is a state of being**  \n\nThere’s no single path to truth, and there aren’t two truths. Truth isn’t stuck in the past or the present; it’s timeless. If you’re quoting the Buddha, Shankara, or Christ, or just repeating what I say, you won’t find truth. Repeating stuff isn’t the same as knowing it. \n\nTruth is a state of being that happens when the mind stops trying to divide and exclude. When the mind is done chasing results or achievements, that’s when truth appears. If you’re forcing yourself to reach a goal, you can’t grasp truth because that goal is just your own idea. Chasing after it, no matter how noble, is like worshipping yourself. You can’t know truth that way. Understanding truth requires seeing the whole process of your mind—when there’s no struggle, that’s when truth reveals itself.  \n\n**August 3**  \n**Truth has no abiding place**\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To understand sorrow, one must be in direct communion with it, free from the distractions of words and theories."
