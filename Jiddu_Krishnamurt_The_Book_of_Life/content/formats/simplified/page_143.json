This is your issue, not just mine. You‚Äôre not here to see how I view things; you‚Äôre here to understand yourself. The inner struggle you face is destructive, and it‚Äôs your problem to tackle.  \n\nYou need to aim for real change in yourself, not just surface-level shifts in politics or economics. It‚Äôs not about understanding me; it‚Äôs about facing your own issues. By discussing them together, we can help each other see things more clearly. But just getting the words isn‚Äôt enough. You need more than that for real psychological change.  \n\nWe have to set aside distractions and get to the core issue: how to dissolve the ‚Äúme,‚Äù which is stuck in time and lacks love and compassion. You can only go beyond this when your mind stops separating the thinker from the thought. When they become one, you find silence‚Äîwhere there‚Äôs no image-making or waiting for more experiences. In that silence, there‚Äôs no one experiencing anything, and that‚Äôs when a true psychological revolution happens.  \n\n### Breaking Habits  \n\nLet‚Äôs dive into how we can understand forming and breaking habits. Take smoking as an example, but feel free to swap in your own habit. Experiment with your issue as I explore smoking. It only becomes a problem when you want to quit. As long as you‚Äôre okay with it, it‚Äôs not an issue.  \n\nThe trouble starts when a habit becomes disruptive. For me, smoking is a disturbance, so I want to be free of it. My goal is to stop smoking, but my approach often turns into resistance or condemnation. I don‚Äôt want to smoke, so I end up fighting against it.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A psychological revolution requires understanding the unity of the thinker and thought to achieve true change beyond superficial societal transformations."
