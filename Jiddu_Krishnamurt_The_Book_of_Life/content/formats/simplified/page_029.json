  "text": "give them nice names like the ideal, the belief, God. But the truth is, I can only see whatâ€™s real when I recognize whatâ€™s fake. A confused mind canâ€™t find the truth. So, I need to figure out whatâ€™s false in my relationships, my ideas, and the stuff around me. To see the truth, I have to understand the false. If I donâ€™t clear away ignorance, enlightenment is just a joke. Chasing enlightenment when my mind is in the dark is pointless. I must start spotting the false in my connections with ideas, people, and things. When I see the false, the true can shine through, and thatâ€™s when I find joy and happiness. âœ¨\n\n---\n\nDoes belief spark enthusiasm? Can enthusiasm last without belief? Or do we need a different kind of energy to keep us going? Most of us get excited about somethingâ€”concerts, workouts, or picnics. But if we donâ€™t keep feeding that enthusiasm, it fades, and we just shift our excitement to something else. Is there a type of energy that doesnâ€™t rely on belief?\n\nAnother question: Do we need any beliefs at all? And if we do, why? We donâ€™t need to believe in sunshine, mountains, or rivers. We donâ€™t need to believe that we argue with our partners. Life can be tough, full of conflict and ambition, and thatâ€™s just a fact. But we cling to beliefs when weâ€™re trying to escape reality.\n\n---\n\nSo, your religion or belief in God might just be a way to dodge reality, which isnâ€™t real religion at all. The wealthy person who gains riches through cruelty and deceit believes in God, and so do you, even if youâ€™re also cunning, cruel, or envious. Can God really be found through dishonesty and tricks? Just collecting sacred books and symbols doesnâ€™t make you religious.\n\nReligion isnâ€™t about escaping facts; itâ€™s about understanding who you are in your daily life. Itâ€™s in how you speak, treat your servants, and interact with your family and neighbors. If you donâ€™t get your relationships with others, there will always be confusion. A confused mind just creates more problems and conflict. A mind that runs from reality wonâ€™t find God; a mind stirred up by beliefs wonâ€™t know the truth. But a mind that understands its connections with property, people, and ideas, and stops struggling, can find clarity. ðŸŒŸ\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Understanding the false in our relationships and beliefs is essential for perceiving the truth and achieving enlightenment."
