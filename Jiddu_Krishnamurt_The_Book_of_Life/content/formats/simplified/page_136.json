  "text": "Our education is mostly just cramming facts into our heads. Think about it: we have journals, radio, TV, and professors who drone on, repeating the same stuff until you memorize it. Then you spit it out during exams, grab your degree, and dive into the grind of jobs and routines. It's all about the same old cycle. \n\nOn top of that, there's our inner battle with ambition and frustration. We’re competing for jobs and even trying to get closer to God, always looking for shortcuts. \n\nWhat’s really happening is that all this pressure and stress are crowding our minds. We’re drowning in influences and sorrow, and instead of using our minds, we’re wearing them down. \n\n### The Old Brain\n\nUnderstanding how our old brain works is crucial. The new brain can’t be understood by the old one. The old brain is conditioned, always seeking comfort and security. Only when this old brain is quiet can we tap into a different kind of clarity. This clarity is vital for understanding. \n\nTo get there, we need to be aware of how the old brain operates—its movements, demands, and tendencies. That’s why meditation is key. I’m not talking about some rigid routine or childish habits. I mean truly observing how the old brain reacts and responds—both consciously and unconsciously. \n\nWhen you see it all without trying to control it or label it as good or bad, the old mind starts to quiet down. \n\n### A Fresh Mind\n\nConstantly striving to be something or become someone is what really ages our minds. Look around: it’s not just the over-60 crowd that feels old; even young people seem mentally exhausted. Very few keep that youthful quality of mind. \n\nAnd by \"young,\" I don’t mean just wanting to have fun. I mean a mind that’s fresh, not scarred by life’s ups and downs. A mind that isn’t worn out by struggle or grief. We need that young mind because the old one is bogged down with memories and can’t truly live or be earnest. \n\nA mind that’s made up its mind and sticks to those decisions is basically dead. But a young mind? It's always open to new possibilities.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Our education often focuses on memorization and repetition, leading to a crowded and worn-out mind that struggles to understand deeper clarity."
