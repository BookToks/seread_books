  "text": "How do emotions start? It's pretty straightforward. They kick in from stimuli through our nerves. Stick a pin in me, and I jump. Flatter me, and I feel great. Insult me, and I’m not happy. Our senses trigger these emotions. Most of us operate on the pleasure principle. You want to be recognized as part of a group—like a Hindu or a Muslim. You take pride in your traditions, whether it’s the Gita or the Quran. Emotions come from stimuli and our surroundings. That’s clear.\n\nNow, what’s the role of emotion in life? Is emotion the same as life? Is pleasure love? Is desire love? If emotion equals love, then it’s always changing, right? You get that.\n\nYou need to see that emotions, sentiment, and enthusiasm don’t equal real affection or compassion. All those feelings are tied to thought, leading to pleasure and pain. True love has no pain or sorrow because it’s not based on pleasure or desire.\n\nSo, what’s the first step? Figure out why you think and feel the way you do. Don’t try to change it or analyze it too much. Just be aware of your thoughts and feelings in the moment. When you do, you’ll notice their subtlety and delicacy. If you’re stuck in “must” and “must not” thinking, you’ll miss the flow of your thoughts and emotions. You've probably been raised with those restrictions, which can limit your thinking and feeling. Let go of those “musts.” That doesn’t mean you should act recklessly, but just be aware of that inner voice saying, “I must” or “I must not.” Then, like a flower blooming in the morning, true intelligence can emerge, functioning and creating understanding.\n\nTraining your intellect doesn’t lead to true intelligence. Intelligence happens when your intellect and emotions work together in harmony. There’s a big difference between intellect and intelligence. Intellect is just thought working alone, without emotion. You can have a sharp intellect but still lack real intelligence if it’s not connected to your feelings.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Emotions arise from stimuli and environment, but true love and compassion transcend pleasure and desire."
