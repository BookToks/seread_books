  "text": "Causation isn't compassion; it’s just a market transaction. That’s one issue. \n\nAnother question is: if I change, how does that impact society? Or do I even care? Most people aren’t into this conversation—just curious or passing by. Machines are advancing so fast that many folks are just being swept along, missing out on real love, compassion, and deep thinking. So if I change, how does that affect my relationship with you? Society isn’t some mythical beast; it’s how we relate to each other. If a few of us change, can that ripple out and impact the world? Can one changed person reach the collective unconscious of humanity? \n\nNow, let’s talk about transmitting compassion. If I care about love and something sacred, how do I share that? If I just use a microphone or propaganda, I might convince someone, but their heart will still be empty. They’ll only repeat what they’ve heard—like politicians talking about kindness and freedom. So, if compulsion doesn’t create true goodness or compassion, what’s the individual supposed to do? \n\nWhat’s the connection between someone who feels compassion and someone stuck in tradition? We need to find that connection—not just in theory, but in real life. \n\nConformity doesn’t lead to goodness. True freedom comes when you understand envy, greed, ambition, and the thirst for power. It’s breaking free from those things that lets character blossom. A person with character understands love—not just someone who spouts off about morality. \n\nThe growth of goodness isn’t found in society, because society is inherently corrupt. Only someone who truly understands society’s structure and is freeing themselves from it can develop real character and blossom into goodness.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The transformation of an individual through understanding and compassion is essential for genuine goodness, as societal structures often corrupt true character."
