  "text": "So, what's the deal with fear? It’s not about asking, “How do I get rid of fear?” If you chase methods or systems to escape fear, you'll just stay stuck in it forever. But if you actually understand fear—like when you feel it up close, just like you feel hunger or the stress of possibly losing your job—then you can do something about it. Only then will you find that all fear can stop—not just some types, but all of it. \n\nFear is basically not accepting reality. It tries to escape in different ways. A big one is identification—like when you link yourself to your country, society, or a certain idea. Have you noticed how you react during a military parade or when your country feels threatened? You suddenly feel part of something bigger, right? Sometimes, you identify with your family or a cause. This identification makes you forget your own struggles. \n\nAs long as you’re aware of “me,” you’ll feel pain and fear. But if you can connect with something greater—like beauty, truth, or even a belief—you get a temporary break from “me.” Talking about “my country” or even God can help you forget yourself for a moment. \n\nSo, do we really get what fear is? It’s not accepting what’s real. And let’s clarify acceptance: it’s not about trying to accept something. When you see reality clearly, acceptance happens naturally. But when you don’t see it clearly, you start forcing acceptance. So, fear is really just not accepting what is. \n\nNow, let’s talk about time. Time is all about moving from “what is” to “what should be.” You think, “I’m afraid, but one day I’ll be free of fear.” This makes you think you need time to get there. But moving from what is to what should be means you’re stuck in effort. You don’t like fear, so you try to analyze it, dissect it, or just escape it. All this takes effort, and we’re used to that struggle. \n\nWe’re always caught between reality and our ideal self, which is just an idea—not the truth of who you are. You can only change “what I am” when you really grasp the chaos that time creates. \n\nSo, is it even possible to ditch fear completely and instantly? If you let fear stick around, you’ll keep creating chaos. That’s how you see that time is part of the problem.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Understanding fear requires direct contact with it, rather than seeking methods to escape it."
