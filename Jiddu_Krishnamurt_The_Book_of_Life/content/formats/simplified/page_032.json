  "text": "**February 15**  \n**Direct Observation**  \n\nWhy do ideas stick in our heads? Why aren’t facts the main focus instead? Why do theories and ideas matter more than reality? Is it because we can’t grasp the facts, we’re not equipped to handle them, or we’re just scared to confront them? So, we cling to ideas and theories as a way to dodge the truth.  \n\nYou can run away or distract yourself, but the facts remain: you feel angry, you have ambitions, you’re sexual—basically, a bunch of truths. You might push them down, twist them into something else (which is just another way of hiding), or try to control them. But all of this is just suppressing those feelings with ideas. Don’t ideas drain our energy? Don’t they dull our minds? You might be smart with your theories and quotes, but quoting a lot doesn’t mean you’re sharp; it’s often a sign of a dull mind.  \n\nWhen you accept the facts, you cut through the conflict right away. You free up your energy to deal with what’s real. Many of us get stuck in contradictions. We want to do one thing but end up doing something else. If you confront the fact of what you want, there’s no contradiction. You focus entirely on what is, and you start to understand it better.  \n\n**February 16**  \n**Action Without Idea**  \n\nYou can only truly experience life when your mind is free from ideas. Ideas aren’t truth; truth is something you have to feel directly, moment by moment. It’s not just a sensation you chase after. To grasp what truth is, you need to move beyond the clutter of ideas—what makes up “you” and your mind, which only exists in fragments and continuity. When your thoughts quiet down completely, that’s when you can really experience.  \n\n**February 17**  \n**Action Without the Process of Thought**  \n\nWhat’s an idea, anyway? It’s basically the process of thinking, right? Thinking is just reacting, whether consciously or unconsciously. It’s verbalizing memories; it’s tied to time. So, when your actions come from thinking, they’ll always be conditioned and isolated. One idea clashes with another, and you get stuck in a loop. There’s a gap between action and idea.  \n\nWe’re exploring whether it’s possible to act without relying on ideas. Ideas tend to divide people. As I mentioned before, knowledge and belief create separation. Beliefs don’t unite us; they pull us apart. When actions are based on beliefs, ideas, or ideals, they become isolated and fragmented. Can we act without going through the thought process?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Ideas often distract us from facing facts, leading to a fragmented understanding of reality."
