  "text": "**December 11**  \n**The Answer to Prayer**  \n\nWhen we pray, we’re just tapping into our own mix of wants and fears. It’s like asking for help when we’re confused or sad. But does turning to someone else really help us find truth? 🤔 \n\nPrayer is just us projecting our desires. We only accept the answers that feel good; otherwise, we’d just toss them aside. If you learn to calm your mind through repetition, you might keep doing it, but remember: the answers you get will reflect what you want, not the truth. \n\nReal understanding can’t come from just repeating words or forcing your mind to be quiet. That kind of stillness isn’t genuine. It’s like putting a kid in timeout — they might look calm, but inside, they’re still boiling over. A mind that’s forced to be quiet isn’t truly still. And that kind of forced stillness won’t lead you to real insights. \n\n**December 12**  \n**Is Religion a Matter of Belief?**  \n\nWhen we think of religion, we often see it as a bunch of beliefs, rules, rituals, and superstitions. It’s about worshiping idols or following gurus to get what we want in life. But the “ultimate truth” we chase is usually just our own wishful thinking — what we believe will make us happy or give us a sense of immortality. \n\nCaught up in all this, our minds create a religion filled with dogmas and superstitions, and we end up stuck. Is that really what religion is? Just a set of beliefs or following a moral code? \n\nBeing moral is easy to imitate; you can just follow the rules. But behind that, the self is still growing and pushing for more. Is that true religion? \n\nYou need to figure out what truth really is because that’s what matters. It’s not about being rich, poor, or having a perfect family — all those things fade away eventually. You have to find the truth for yourself, without relying on beliefs. Beliefs just trap you and cloud your mind. True freedom comes from self-reliance and initiative.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Prayer and organized religion are seen as projections of the mind that do not lead to true understanding or reality."
