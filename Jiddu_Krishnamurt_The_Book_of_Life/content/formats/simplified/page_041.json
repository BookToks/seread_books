  "text": "**Pain of Attachment**  \n\nAttachment hurts, and when it gets tough, we look for something else to cling to. It’s all about attachment, and trying to detach is kind of pointless. Books say, “Be detached,” but here’s the reality: when you try to detach, you just end up attached to something new. 🤔  \n\n**Attachment is Self-Deception**  \n\nWe are what we own. Our attachments define us. There’s nothing noble about being attached. Clinging to knowledge is just like any other addiction. Whether it’s low-key or high-key, attachment is all about being wrapped up in ourselves. It’s a way to escape the emptiness we feel inside. The stuff we attach to—like property, people, or ideas—becomes super important because without them, we feel empty. Fear of not existing drives us to possess things, creating illusions that trap us. These illusions stop us from being truly intelligent. Without freedom, we mistake cleverness for true intelligence. Cleverness can be complicated and destructive. This self-protective cleverness leads to attachment. When attachment brings pain, we seek detachment and take pride in pretending to let go. Understanding this cleverness and the self is where real intelligence begins.  \n\n**Face the Fact and See What Happens**  \n\nWe’ve all felt that deep loneliness, where everything—books, religion, you name it—just disappears, leaving us feeling empty inside. Most of us can’t handle that emptiness, so we run away from it. We depend on distractions—like music, books, or endless chatter about random stuff—to avoid being alone with ourselves. We might have great jobs and stay busy, but inside, there’s still a huge void. We try to fill that void with dependence, entertainment, or even relationships. If we realize how pointless it is to cover up that emptiness—truly see the absurdity of it—we’re faced with a fact. It’s not about how to escape dependence; that’s just a reaction to the reality. So, why not just face the fact and see what happens?  \n\nNow, here’s the kicker: the observer and the observed. The observer says, “I’m empty; I don’t like it,” and runs away. But guess what? The observer is the emptiness. It’s not emptiness seen from a distance. The observer is the observed. When you realize this, it sparks a major shift in how you think and feel. 🌟\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Attachment is a form of self-deception that fills the emptiness of the self, leading to a cycle of dependence and avoidance of true understanding."
