When there’s a gap between what you hear and how you react, that space—whether it’s long or just a few seconds—can bring clarity. This gap is where your “new brain” kicks in. Your immediate reactions come from the “old brain,” which just runs on habits and instincts. But when you pause that reaction, the new brain can step up, and it’s only this new brain that truly gets it.\n\n---\n\nTo change the world, we need to start with ourselves. And the key? Intention. We have to want to understand ourselves instead of waiting for others to change or for some big revolution—whether left or right. This is on us; it’s your job and mine. Even if our personal world feels small, if we can shift our perspective in daily life, we might just impact the bigger world around us.\n\n---\n\nChange can happen consciously or unconsciously, but it’s still change. Conscious change means putting in effort, and even unconscious change involves struggle. As long as there’s conflict, change isn’t real; it’s just forced. So, can we tackle issues like greed without trying too hard? You can’t see the full picture of greed if you’re focused on trying to change it. Real change comes when you look at the problem with fresh eyes, not weighed down by past experiences. A cluttered mind can’t be fresh. It only clears up when you recognize what’s occupying it. You won’t see the truth if you’re just reshaping what’s said to fit your view. To discover something new, you need to approach it with a clear mind, and that’s impossible if your mind is busy.\n\n---\n\nThis takes deep insight and self-inquiry. Don’t just take my word for it—dig into this yourself. Question everything. Does knowledge, the stuff we already know, really lead to change? You need knowledge to build a foundation, but...\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To transform the world, we must first understand and change ourselves, as this personal responsibility can lead to broader societal change."
