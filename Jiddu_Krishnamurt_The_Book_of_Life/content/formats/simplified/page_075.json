  "text": "No part of the mind is unconditioned.  \n\nYour mind is totally conditioned—no exceptions. That’s just how it is, like it or not. You might think there’s a part of you—the watcher, the super-soul, the Atma—that’s unconditioned. But since you think about it, it’s still in the realm of thought, which means it’s conditioned too. You can come up with all sorts of theories, but the truth is, your mind is conditioned all the way through, both conscious and unconscious. Even when it tries to break free, that effort is still conditioned. So, what’s the mind supposed to do? What happens when it realizes it’s conditioned and that any attempt to uncondition itself is also conditioned?  \n\nWhen you say, “I know I’m conditioned,” do you truly know it, or is that just lip service? Do you feel it with the same intensity as when you see a cobra? When you spot a snake and recognize it as a cobra, your reaction is instant and real. But when you say, “I know I’m conditioned,” does it carry that same weight? Or is it just a surface acknowledgment? When I really grasp that I’m conditioned, it triggers immediate action. I don’t need to struggle to uncondition myself. Just realizing I’m conditioned brings clarity. The struggle comes from not fully understanding its implications—that all thought, no matter how subtle or clever, is conditioned.  \n\nInwardly, there’s a heavy weight of the past pushing you in a certain direction.  \n\nSo, how do you wipe that slate clean? How can you instantly cleanse the unconscious of the past? Analysts believe they can partially or fully clean it up through methods like analysis, exploration, confession, or dream interpretation, so you can be a “normal” person who fits into today’s world. But in analysis, there’s always an analyzer and the analyzed—a duality that creates conflict.  \n\nI see that just analyzing the unconscious doesn’t really help. Sure, it might make me a bit less neurotic or kinder to my wife or neighbor, but that’s not the real issue. I realize that the analytical process— which takes time, involves interpretation, and has the observer analyzing the observed—can’t free the unconscious. So, I completely reject analysis. The moment I see that analysis can’t clear the burden of the unconscious, I step away from it. I stop analyzing. What happens next? There’s no longer an analyzer.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Your mind is entirely conditioned, and any effort to uncondition it is also influenced by that conditioning."
