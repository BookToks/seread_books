  "text": "The mind can totally break free from all its conditioning. Only then can it discover what’s beyond just thinking. \n\nNo matter how smart or simple the mind is, it’s still limited. It’s conditioned, whether we realize it or not. Any attempt to extend this conditioning still stays within the realm of thought. So, true freedom? That’s something entirely different. \n\n---\n\n**February**  \n\n**February 1**  \n**Becoming is Strife**  \n\nLife, as we know it, is all about becoming. I’m broke, and I want to be rich. I feel ugly, and I want to be beautiful. Basically, my life is a constant chase to become something else. The will to exist is the will to change, happening at different levels and states, filled with challenges and responses. But this process of becoming? It’s a struggle, right? I am this, and I want to be that. \n\n**February 2**  \n**All Becoming is Disintegration**  \n\nThe mind gets an idea, maybe something fun, and wants to be that. This is just a projection of what you desire. You don’t like where you are, and you want to be somewhere else. But that ideal is just a self-projection. The so-called opposite is really just a twist on what already is. The projection is driven by your own will, and that’s where the conflict comes in. You’re trying to become something that’s actually part of you. \n\nWhen you realize this trick your mind has played, you see the false for what it is. Chasing an illusion only leads to disintegration. All conflict and striving? That’s what tears you apart. Once you’re aware of this trick, you’re left with just what is. When the mind lets go of all the striving, ideals, and comparisons, it collapses its own structure. At that point, what is can transform completely. As long as you keep naming what is, there’s a connection between your mind and reality. But when that naming—your memory, the very structure of your mind—stops, then what is simply isn’t. Only through this transformation can you find true integration.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The mind's struggle to become something different is a source of conflict and disintegration, and true transformation occurs when it is free from all ideals and projections."
