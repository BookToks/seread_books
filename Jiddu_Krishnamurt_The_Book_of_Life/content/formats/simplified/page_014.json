  "text": "**February 3**  \n**Can the crude mind become sensitive?**  \n\nLet’s break this down. Can a rough mind become sensitive? If I think my mind is crude and try to change it, that effort is just more crudity. Get it? Instead of getting caught up in trying to change, just recognize your crudeness. Don’t rush to fix it. Observe it in your daily life—like how you eat too greedily, treat others roughly, or act prideful and arrogant. That awareness can actually change things. \n\nSame goes for intelligence. If I think I’m dumb and want to be smart, that push to be intelligent is just a deeper form of stupidity. What really matters is understanding my own stupidity. No matter how much I try to seem smart—by quoting books or repeating wise words—I’ll still be dumb if I don’t see how it shows up in my life. Notice how I treat others, whether they’re a servant, a neighbor, or anyone else. That awareness can break down my stupidity. \n\n**February 4**  \n**Opportunities for self-expansion**  \n\nHierarchical structures can be tempting for self-growth. You might want brotherhood, but how can you have it if you're chasing spiritual titles? You might laugh at worldly labels, but when you elevate someone to Master or guru status, aren’t you just bringing that same attitude into spirituality? \n\nLove doesn’t do divisions. You either love or you don’t. Don’t drag out the process of getting to love. When you see you’re lacking love, that’s when real change can happen. But if you keep separating the Master from the student or the saint from the sinner, you’re missing the point of love. This creates a cycle of exploitation and illusion. \n\nThe gap between you and reality is created by your own mind, which clings to what it knows—certainty and security. You can’t bridge that gap with rituals, disciplines, or sacrifices. No guru can lead you there or remove that separation. The division exists within you. \n\nWhat’s crucial is to understand the growing conflict of desire. That understanding comes from knowing yourself and being constantly aware of how you operate.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The crude mind cannot become sensitive through effort, but rather through understanding and observing its own nature."
