  "text": "**November 24**  \n**Love Without Motive**  \n\nWhat’s love without a reason? Can you really love without wanting something in return? If I show you kindness and you ignore me, doesn’t that sting? That hurt comes from friendship and caring. As long as I feel pain, as long as I’m scared, and as long as I help you expecting help back—that’s not real love. Get this, and you’ll find the answer.  \n\n**November 25**  \n**Love Is Dangerous**  \n\nHow can anyone live without love? Just existing without love leads to control, chaos, and suffering—that’s what most of us are stuck in. We organize our lives but accept conflict as normal because we’re always chasing power. Sure, when love is present, organization has its place. But without love, it turns into a nightmare—just cold efficiency, like an army. In a society obsessed with efficiency, we end up needing armies, which only create war. Even in “peace,” the more efficient we get, the more ruthless and heartless we become. That’s why there’s so much confusion today, why bureaucracy is growing, and why more governments are turning authoritarian. We accept this as normal because we’re stuck in our heads, not our hearts—so love doesn’t thrive. Love is the most unpredictable and risky thing in life. We avoid that risk because we crave certainty, so we stick to our minds. A person who truly loves is seen as dangerous, and we don’t want that; we want to be efficient and organized, thinking that will bring peace. But organizations have never created true order and peace. Only love, kindness, and compassion can do that—now and always.  \n\n**November 26**  \n**What Is Your Reaction?**  \n\nWhen you see those struggling women carrying heavy loads to the market or watch peasant kids playing in the mud with barely anything, kids who won’t get the education you have, who lack proper homes, clean clothes, and enough food—what do you feel? It’s crucial to figure out your reaction. Here’s mine:  \n\nThose kids don’t have a decent place to sleep. Their parents work all day without a break. Those kids don’t know what it’s like to be loved or cared for.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Love is fundamentally different from pleasure and cannot exist with motives or expectations."
