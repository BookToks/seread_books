  "text": "### A Passion for Everything  \n\nFor most people, passion is just about one thing: sex. Or you get caught up in suffering and try to fix it. But I’m talking about passion as a mindset, a way of being. It’s that deep feeling inside you that’s super sensitive—sensitive to dirt, poverty, wealth, corruption, the beauty of a tree, a bird, the flow of water, or a pond reflecting the evening sky. Feeling all this intensely is essential. Without passion, life feels empty and shallow. If you can’t appreciate the beauty of a tree and truly care about it, you’re not really living.  \n\n### Love is Passion  \n\nYou can’t be sensitive without passion. Don’t shy away from the word. Many religious texts and gurus say, “Don’t have passion.” But how can you notice the ugly and the beautiful, the rustling leaves, the sunset, a smile, or a tear without passion? You need that sense of passion to fully engage with life. Listen up: don’t ask how to get passion. You’re already passionate about things like landing a good job or feeling jealous. I’m talking about a different kind of passion—a love that transcends “me.” Love isn’t about judging what’s right or wrong; it’s beyond contradictions. How can you love without passion? Without it, how can you be sensitive? Being sensitive means feeling your neighbor next to you, recognizing the ugliness of your surroundings, and appreciating the beauty of nature. If you lack passion, how can you truly feel a smile or a tear? Remember, love is passion.  \n\n### A Passionate Mind is Inquiring  \n\nThere must be passion, and the real question is how to bring it back. Let’s be clear: I mean passion in every way, not just sexual passion, which is pretty limited. Many settle for that because other passions have faded away—thanks to jobs, routines, and learning techniques. That’s why sex can feel so significant, but it often leads to a shallow obsession or becomes a habit that fades. I’m talking about passion as a whole. A passionate person isn’t satisfied with just any job—whether they’re a prime minister, a cook, or something else. A passionate mind is curious, searching, questioning, and demanding more than the ordinary.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Passion is essential for a meaningful life, as it fosters sensitivity to both beauty and suffering beyond mere sexual desire."
