  "text": "Extensional awareness shows us all the hidden layers and their meanings. This awareness uncovers a creative emptiness that can't be imagined or put into words. Extensional awareness and creative emptiness are part of one whole process, not separate stages. When you quietly observe a problem without judging or justifying it, you enter a state of passive awareness. In this state, the problem gets understood and fades away. \n\nAwareness boosts sensitivity, which can lead to deep negative thinking. When your mind is busy creating and solving problems, true creation can't happen. Real creativity emerges only when the mind is calm and empty. It’s not about making something out of nothing; it’s about letting go of the need for results. A problem only exists when you're chasing an outcome. Stop that chase, and the problem disappears.\n\nIn self-awareness, there's no need for confession. Self-awareness acts like a mirror, reflecting everything clearly. Every thought and feeling can be seen and understood, but this flow gets blocked by judgment or acceptance. The more you observe that reflection—not out of duty, but because pain drives you to understand—the deeper your awareness becomes, leading to greater understanding.\n\nJust like you can follow something moving slowly, thoughts and feelings need to be explored at a slower pace. Once you learn to do this, your mind can speed up while remaining calm. Think of a fan: when it spins fast, it looks like a solid disk. Our challenge is to slow down our minds so we can track each thought and feeling. What you truly understand won’t keep coming back.\n\nNow, let’s talk about violence. What happens when you focus completely on what we call violence? This isn’t just about physical harm; it’s also about the divisions created by beliefs and the need for personal security. Can you look at that violence with full attention? When you do, what happens? Most of us probably haven’t given our full attention to anything. But when you do, you find that real attention involves care. And you can’t truly care without affection.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Extensional awareness reveals creative emptiness and understanding, allowing problems to dissolve through passive observation without judgment."
