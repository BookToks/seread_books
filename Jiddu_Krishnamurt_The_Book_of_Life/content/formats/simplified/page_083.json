  "text": "When you focus on understanding something, the background noise can get in the way. But if you're really invested in grasping the fact, that interest can clear out the distractions.  \n\n**June 16**  \n**Introspection is Incomplete**  \n\nAwareness is all about the present. When you’re aware, you can see how past influences shape your current thoughts and decisions. Awareness isn’t about breaking things down; it’s about seeing the whole picture. For instance, if I ask, “Do I believe in God?” being aware means I can notice what’s driving that question. I can see the fears passed down from my ancestors, mixed with my own feelings, which have changed my idea of God. When I’m aware, I get the full story of how the past affects my present and future.  \n\nIf you’re aware, you’ll notice how fear shaped your view of God. Maybe someone had a real experience of the divine and shared it, but then it got twisted by someone else’s greed, leading to imitation. Awareness is about seeing everything as a complete process, while introspection often feels heavy and painful. Awareness, on the other hand, brings excitement and joy.  \n\n**June 17**  \n**Seeing the Whole**  \n\nHow do you look at a tree? Do you see it as a whole? If not, you’re missing the point. You might just say, “There’s a tree, cool!” or label it as a mango tree or a tamarind tree. But if you really stop and look, you won’t see the entire tree. If you miss the whole tree, you’re not really seeing it at all.  \n\nAwareness works the same way. If you don’t see your mind’s operations as a complete picture—like seeing all parts of a tree—you’re not truly aware. A tree has roots, a trunk, branches, leaves—some healthy, some dead, some eaten. You need to see all of that to understand the tree.  \n\nIn the same way, when you’re aware of your mind, you recognize everything: your judgments, approvals, struggles, hopes, and frustrations. Awareness includes it all, not just bits and pieces. So, are you seeing your mind like you would see a full picture—not just one corner and wondering, “Who painted that?”  \n\n**June 18**  \n**Awareness Cannot Be Disciplined**\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Awareness is an integral process that allows one to perceive the entirety of their thoughts and experiences, unlike incomplete introspection."
