  "text": "Parents often talk to their kids about sorrow, but they don’t really get it. They just have a vague idea or a label for it. They don’t actually face sorrow; they only know the word.\n\n**July 25  \nEvading Sorrow**\n\nMost of us deal with sorrow in different ways — through relationships, losing someone, feeling unfulfilled, or failing at our goals. There’s also physical sorrow — illness, disability, and so on. Sorrow is everywhere, and death is always lurking. We don’t know how to handle it, so we either glorify it, make excuses, or try to escape from it. \n\nGo to any church, and you’ll see how sorrow is celebrated. They say you can only find God through the pain of Christ. In the East, there are also ways to dodge sorrow. It’s wild how few people, no matter where they are, are truly free from it.\n\nImagine if, while listening to this without getting emotional or sentimental, you could really understand sorrow and break free from it. Then, there would be no self-deception, no illusions, no anxiety, and no fear. Your mind could think clearly and logically. And maybe then, you’d know what love really is.\n\n**July 26  \nFollow the Movement of Suffering**\n\nWhat is suffering? What does it really mean? Instead of asking why it happens or what causes it, focus on what’s actually going on. There’s a difference. When I acknowledge suffering as part of me — not just something I watch from a distance — I can trace its path. \n\nIf I do this, I start to see that I’ve been focused on “me,” not on the person I love. They were my shield from loneliness and pain. Now that they’re gone, I feel lost and alone. I cry not just for them, but because I’m left with nothing.\n\nThere are countless people out there offering me escape — religious figures with their beliefs, promises, and fantasies. They say, “It’s karma, it’s God’s will.” But what if I just stay with my suffering? What happens to my mind when I let it unfold instead of pushing it away?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sorrow is a pervasive experience that many avoid or rationalize, yet true understanding and acceptance of it can lead to freedom from self-deception and clearer perception of love."
