  "text": "Forgiveness isn't real if it’s just a way to avoid getting hurt again. \n\nSo, why does our mind hold onto memories? It’s always trying to build itself up, to become something more. But when the mind is okay with being nothing, that’s when real compassion happens. In that space, there’s no need for forgiveness or hurt. To get there, you have to look closely at how the “me” develops.\n\nAs long as you’re focused on cultivating specific traits or influences, you can’t truly love or show compassion. Love and compassion come naturally, not from trying hard to be virtuous.\n\n---\n\nIf you love someone, you should be free, right? But if your actions can hurt them, is it really love? That’s just a form of possession, wanting to control each other. True love means you won’t cause pain when you act in what you believe is right. Pain comes when you want them to meet your desires or vice versa.\n\nChasing comfort and security in a relationship can feel safe, but it’s temporary. Each struggle for comfort shows a lack of inner richness. When you act separately from your partner, it creates conflict and suffering. Often, people suppress their true feelings to fit in, and that kind of love isn’t freeing—it’s a subtle form of bondage.\n\n---\n\nSorrow happens when something shakes up your routine—a death, losing a job, or questioning a belief. A disturbed mind just wants to find peace again, so it clings to new beliefs, safer jobs, or new relationships. But life will always throw challenges your way, and the mind just keeps building more defenses. \n\nThis isn’t true intelligence. \n\nNo kind of external pressure will help you. All compulsion comes from ignorance, driven by the desire for rewards or the fear of punishment. To truly understand the nature of your traps is the way to break free.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The mind's tendency to remember and store hurt prevents true compassion and love, as it seeks to protect itself rather than understand its own nature."
