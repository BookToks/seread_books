  "text": "Being hungry is just that—hunger. No thoughts, no ideas. Then you start thinking about what to eat, and based on what feels good, you choose. When you face what is real, like hunger, you act without hesitation. \n\n**Freedom from What Is**  \nBeing virtuous means understanding what is. Trying to become virtuous? That’s just avoiding the truth. You cover up reality with what you wish it could be. Chasing ideals doesn’t help you face what’s real. True virtue isn’t about becoming something else; it’s about grasping what is and finding freedom from it. Virtue is crucial in a world that’s falling apart.\n\n**Observing Thought**  \nTo truly get something, like a child, you need to love it. Don’t judge or blame. Play, watch, and understand their quirks. The same goes for understanding reality. You have to observe your thoughts, feelings, and actions moment by moment. That’s where the truth lies.\n\n**Escape Breeds Conflict**  \nWhy are we so ambitious? Why do we need to succeed or stand out? This drive to assert ourselves, whether through personal achievements or beliefs, often leads to conflict and confusion. Can we live without ambition? \n\nAmbition often comes from wanting to escape reality. This cleverness? It’s actually pretty foolish. Why are we so scared of what is? Running away doesn’t change the fact that we still exist. You might find a temporary escape, but the underlying issues remain, causing conflict and pain. Why fear loneliness or emptiness? Any distraction from reality only brings more sorrow. Conflict arises when we deny or flee from what is. It gets complicated because we avoid facing the truth. But reality itself isn’t complex—it's our many escapes that create the mess.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Virtue arises from understanding and confronting what is, rather than avoiding it through ideals."
