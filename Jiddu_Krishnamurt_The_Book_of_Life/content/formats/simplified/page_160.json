  "text": "Is it possible to have a mind that’s totally free? One that isn’t swayed by its own experiences or anyone else’s? A mind that’s pure and alone? Only then can we create a new world, a new culture, and a society where happiness can actually happen. 🌍\n\n**Aloneness Without Fear**\n\nReal creativity comes when the mind can let go of all outside influences. \n\nThese days, we’re drowning in techniques for influencing others—through propaganda, pressure, imitation, and hero worship. There are tons of guides on how to think better, build stuff, or even put together machines. But in the process, we’re losing our ability to think for ourselves. In school, in politics, everywhere, we’re pushed to fit in and copy others. When we let one influence sway us, we end up resisting others. But isn’t that just giving in, just in a different way? 🤔\n\nShouldn’t our minds always challenge these influences to really understand how they shape us? A mediocre mind is often scared and confused, craving order and consistency. But these desires only create contradictions and chaos within us. Choosing between influences is still a sign of mediocrity. \n\nOur minds need to dig deep—not just imitate or conform. They should be fearless and alone, which leads to true creativity. And remember, that creativity isn't just yours or mine; it’s something bigger than us. \n\n**Start Here**\n\nA true religious person isn’t on a quest for God. They focus on transforming society, which is really about transforming themselves. Following rituals or traditions, endlessly analyzing scriptures, or living in a past culture? That’s not what being religious is about; it’s just running away from reality. \n\nA genuine religious person understands that they are part of society, not separate from it. To truly change, they need to let go of greed, envy, and ambition. That way, they won’t rely on their circumstances, even though they are shaped by them—like the food they eat, the books they read, or the movies they watch.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A truly creative mind must be completely alone and free from external influences to foster genuine transformation in society."
