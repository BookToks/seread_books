  "text": "If you make awareness a habit, it can get boring and painful. Awareness can't be forced. Once you start practicing it, it stops being true awareness because practice means creating a habit and putting in effort. That effort distorts your experience. \n\nAwareness isn't just about whatâ€™s outsideâ€”like birds flying, shadows, the waves, trees swaying, or the contrast between a beggar and fancy cars. It's also about what's going on inside youâ€”the tension and conflict in your mind. You donâ€™t judge a bird in flight; you just admire it. But when it comes to your own inner struggles, you either condemn or justify them. You struggle to observe your internal conflicts without bias.\n\nBeing aware of your thoughts and feelings without getting caught up in them isnâ€™t tedious or painful. But when you chase a result or an end goal, it just ramps up the conflict and makes everything more exhausting.\n\nAwareness means taking in everythingâ€”the crows in the sky, the flowers on the trees, the people around you and what theyâ€™re wearing. Itâ€™s about being aware of the whole picture, not just bits and pieces. If you only focus on a narrow aspect of yourself, your mind stays limited and mediocre. But when you embrace the entirety of your beingâ€”every thought, every feelingâ€”you let them unfold freely, which is way different from just concentrating on something specific.\n\nLetting a thought or feeling \"flower\" requires attention, not just focus. By \"flowering,\" I mean giving your thoughts the freedom to develop and see where they lead. Anything that blooms needs space and light. You canâ€™t label thoughts as right or wrong; doing that limits their growth. They can only fully develop in a state of awareness. If you dig deep into this process, youâ€™ll realize that letting thoughts flower can actually lead to the end of thought itself.\n\nIn true awareness, there's no striving or goals. Itâ€™s all about silent observation without judgment, which leads to understanding. When your thoughts and feelings can express themselves freelyâ€”without trying to grab or hold onto themâ€”true understanding emerges. ðŸŒ±\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Awareness, when practiced as a habit, becomes tedious and painful, as it involves effort and distortion rather than the natural observation of thoughts and feelings."
