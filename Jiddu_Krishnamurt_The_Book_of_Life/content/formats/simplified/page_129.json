  "text": "**September 30**  \n**The Religious Mind Includes the Scientific Mind**  \n\nA religious mind is free from all authority. That’s tough to achieve. It’s not just about outside rules but also the authority of past experiences and traditions. A religious mind doesn’t cling to beliefs or dogmas; it moves from fact to fact. So, the religious mind is like the scientific mind. But a scientific mind isn’t necessarily religious.  \n\nThe religious mind cares about the big picture—not just one part of life, but the whole human experience. In contrast, the brain focuses on specific tasks. It specializes, whether as a scientist, doctor, engineer, musician, artist, or writer. These narrow skills create division, both inside us and in society. Right now, scientists and doctors are seen as the most important people. Function becomes everything, and with that comes status and prestige. But specialization leads to contradictions and a limited view, which is just how the brain works.  \n\n**October 1**  \n**Time Provides No Solution**  \n\nAll religions say we need time—specifically, psychological time. Heaven feels far away, and we think we can only reach it through gradual evolution, suppression, growth, or connecting with something superior. But can we be free from fear right now? Because if we don’t, fear creates chaos. Psychological time often leads to serious inner disorder.  \n\nI’m questioning the whole idea of evolution—not the physical side, but the evolution of thought tied to a specific existence in time. Our brains have evolved to this point and might keep evolving. But I’ve spent forty or fifty years in a world full of theories, conflicts, and greed, envy, and competition that lead to wars. I’m part of that mess. For someone in pain, waiting for time to solve problems isn’t meaningful. Can we be free from fear and psychological time as we are? Physical time is unavoidable; you can’t escape that. The real question is whether psychological time can bring order within us and beyond.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A religious mind transcends authority and beliefs, encompassing the totality of human existence, while the scientific mind remains specialized and divided."
