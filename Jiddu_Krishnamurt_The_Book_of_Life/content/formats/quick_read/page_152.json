  "text": "The idea of a continuous soul has no meaning. \n\nIt is an invention of a frightened mind. \n\nThis mind seeks permanence and certainty. \n\nIn that, it finds hope. \n\nKarma means cause and effect. \n\nAction produces results based on conditioning. \n\nCause and effect are not fixed. \n\nToday results from yesterday's actions. \n\nToday also causes tomorrow's outcomes. \n\nThere is no fixed cause or effect. \n\nSpecialization leads to death. \n\nHumans can renew themselves; they are not specialized. \n\nConflict arises when cause is seen as unrelated to effect. \n\nThe issue is how to act, not belief in reincarnation or karma. \n\nAction based on past experience leads to pain. \n\nFree action does not produce conditioning or pain. \n\nOnly in freedom can you discover truth.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The concept of reincarnation is a construct of a fearful mind seeking permanence, while karma represents a continuous interplay of cause and effect without fixed outcomes."
