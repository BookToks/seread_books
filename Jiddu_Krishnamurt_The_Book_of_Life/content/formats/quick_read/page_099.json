  "text": "Forgiveness does not know forgiveness.  \n\nIt forgives to avoid further hurt.  \n\nWe must discover why the mind remembers.  \n\nThe mind seeks to aggrandize itself.  \n\nWhen the mind is nothing, there is compassion.  \n\nIn that state, there is no forgiveness or hurt.  \n\nUnderstanding requires recognizing the \"me.\"  \n\nConscious cultivation of virtue prevents love.  \n\nLove and compassion do not result from effort.  \n\nWhere pain exists, love cannot be free.  \n\nTrue love does not cause pain.  \n\nDesire for possession creates suffering.  \n\nStruggles for comfort reveal inner lack.  \n\nRepression in love destroys both individuals.  \n\nThis love is a subtle bondage.  \n\nSorrow results from shock and disturbance.  \n\nThe disturbed mind seeks refuge in new beliefs.  \n\nThis cycle is not the way of intelligence.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The mind's tendency to remember and store hurt prevents true compassion and love, as it seeks to protect itself rather than understand its own nature."
