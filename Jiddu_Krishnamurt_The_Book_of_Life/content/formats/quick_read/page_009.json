  "text": "Most of us accept authority for continuity and protection.  \n\nBut to understand this psychological revolution, one must be free of authority.  \n\nOne cannot rely on any authority, including personal experience.  \n\nIs it possible to not depend on my own judgment or analysis?  \n\nEven after rejecting external authorities, I may still trust my judgment.  \n\nBut can I truly rely on my experiences?  \n\nMy experiences stem from my conditioning, as yours do from yours.  \n\nCultural and social backgrounds shape our experiences.  \n\nCan I depend on that for guidance or hope?  \n\nI realize that reality and newness arise only when the mind is empty.  \n\nThis means no past judgments, no experiences, and no authority.  \n\nSelf-knowledge is essential to understand our problems.  \n\nSelf-awareness does not mean isolation or withdrawal.  \n\nKnowing oneself requires relationships, not exclusion.  \n\nSelf-knowledge is a process, not an end.  \n\nWe discover ourselves in relationships, requiring alertness and perception.  \n\nTransformation of the world begins with self-transformation.  \n\nKnowing oneself is crucial for right thought and transformation.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To achieve true self-knowledge and transformation, one must be free from all forms of authority and conditioning, understanding oneself in the context of relationships rather than isolation."
