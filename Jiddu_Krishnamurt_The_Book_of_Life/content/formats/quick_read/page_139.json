  "text": "Comprehension is not just intellectual understanding. \n\nIf there is a gap between words and your reaction, observe it. \n\nIn that interval, clarity arises. \n\nThe interval represents the new brain. \n\nThe immediate reaction comes from the old brain. \n\nThe old brain reacts traditionally and instinctively. \n\nWhen reaction is suspended, the new brain can act. \n\nOnly the new brain can truly understand. \n\nTo transform the world, we must start with ourselves. \n\nOur intention should be to understand ourselves. \n\nWe must not rely on others for change. \n\nThis responsibility is ours alone. \n\nIf we transform ourselves, we can influence others. \n\nChange can be conscious or unconscious. \n\nBoth require effort and struggle. \n\nReal change happens when the mind approaches problems anew. \n\nA fresh mind is necessary for true understanding. \n\nThe mind is occupied when it does not see its own truth.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To transform the world, we must first understand and change ourselves, as this personal responsibility can lead to broader societal change."
