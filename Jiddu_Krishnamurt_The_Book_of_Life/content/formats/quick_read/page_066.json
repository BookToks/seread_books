  "text": "What do you mean by love for your spouse? \n\nDo you love what gives you pleasure? \n\nDo you love what you identify as yours? \n\nWe often love the image of “my wife” or “my husband.” \n\nWe do not truly know our partners. \n\nKnowing means recognition, which is based on memory. \n\nMemory includes pleasure, pain, and attachment. \n\nHow can one love amidst fear and sorrow? \n\nAmbition often clouds the ability to love. \n\nTo understand love, we must let go of the past. \n\nWe must release all emotions, both good and bad. \n\nIn today's world, we lose the capacity for great feelings. \n\nGreat feeling involves deep perception and sensitivity. \n\nMany problems hinder our ability to feel deeply. \n\nTrue feelings appreciate beauty and sorrow. \n\nStrong feelings make the mind sensitive. \n\nObservation without thought generates energy.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** True love is often an attachment to the image of a person rather than an understanding of their true self, and to truly love, one must transcend past emotions and problems to experience deep feelings."
