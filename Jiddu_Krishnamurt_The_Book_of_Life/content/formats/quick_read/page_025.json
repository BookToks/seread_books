  "text": "The mind is often caught in the past. \n\nWhen it focuses on the past, it cannot see the new. \n\nThinking creates effort and struggle. \n\nWe ask, “How can I avoid evil thoughts?” \n\nIs there a thinker separate from these thoughts? \n\nWe identify ourselves with judgments and controls. \n\nBut is the “I” different from thought and envy? \n\nThe “I” always tries to overcome these thoughts. \n\nThis creates a struggle to control thoughts. \n\nThinking itself generates the problem of effort. \n\nWe then seek discipline to control our thoughts. \n\nLife involves a process of becoming something. \n\nWe strive to change from poor to rich or ugly to beautiful. \n\nThis process of becoming leads to strife and pain. \n\nThe mind desires to align with pleasurable ideas. \n\nBut ideals are self-projections, not true opposites. \n\nIn the end, we pursue our own projections. \n\nWe struggle with our own shadows and conflicts.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The mind's struggle to become something different from itself leads to conflict and disintegration."
