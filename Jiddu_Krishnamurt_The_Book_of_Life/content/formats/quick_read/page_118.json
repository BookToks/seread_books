  "text": "We spend our time cultivating the intellect. \n\nWe argue, discuss, and struggle to be something. \n\nThis wonderful world is ours, not just one place. \n\nWe have divided it through our pettiness and provincialism. \n\nWe seek security and better jobs, which drives this division. \n\nIn doing so, we forget to be human and live happily. \n\nUnderstanding comes when the mind is quiet. \n\nThere is a flash of understanding when thought is absent. \n\nThis understanding cannot be cultivated; a cultivated mind is dead. \n\nThe more interested you are, the clearer your mind becomes. \n\nVerbalization and words interfere with understanding. \n\nTruth is subtle and cannot be held by the mind. \n\nYou can know yourself when you are unaware. \n\nWhen the mind is open, you can meet the unknown. \n\nIf you have preconceptions, you cannot comprehend the unknown. \n\nYou are the unknown; you cannot know it if prepared.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** We often focus on cultivating the intellect at the expense of true understanding and human connection with the world around us."
