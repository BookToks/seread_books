  "text": "We want to escape our loneliness and fears.  \n\nWe depend on others for companionship.  \n\nWe are the prime movers in our relationships.  \n\nWhen others demand something, we feel shocked and grieved.  \n\nIf our fortress is strong, outside battering matters little.  \n\nWe must understand our tendencies as we age.  \n\nOur fears need observation and understanding now.  \n\nWe should comprehend our loneliness, demands, and frailties.  \n\nLiving alone is impossible; all living involves relationships.  \n\nLiving without direct relationships requires high intelligence.  \n\nA lone existence can strengthen negative tendencies.  \n\nWe must recognize and understand our aging habits.  \n\nInward riches bring peace and joy.  \n\nFear breeds illusion and dullness in the mind.  \n\nWhere there is fear, there is no freedom or love.  \n\nWe have many fears, including fear of death.  \n\nUnderstanding fear is essential for freedom from it.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** We depend on others to escape our loneliness and fears, but true understanding of ourselves is essential for inner peace and freedom from fear."
