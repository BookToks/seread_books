  "text": "Pain comes from attachment. \n\nYou seek something to attach to escape it. \n\nAttachment is all there is. \n\nCultivating detachment leads to new attachments. \n\nWe are what we possess. \n\nAttachment lacks nobility. \n\nIt is like any other addiction. \n\nAttachment is self-absorption and self-deception. \n\nThe things we cling to fill our emptiness. \n\nFear of not being drives possession. \n\nFear creates illusions and binds us to conclusions. \n\nConclusions hinder intelligence and freedom. \n\nCunning masquerades as intelligence. \n\nCunning fosters attachment and seeks detachment when in pain. \n\nUnderstanding this cunning begins intelligence. \n\nLoneliness is a common experience. \n\nWe often flee from that emptiness. \n\nDependence fills the void we fear. \n\nWe must face the fact of our emptiness.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Attachment is a form of self-deception that fills the emptiness of the self, leading to a cycle of dependence and avoidance of true understanding."
