  "text": "The formation of new habits ends when the mind is free. \n\nThis is important to understand. \n\nWhile breaking one habit, the mind creates another. \n\nA free mind can perceive beyond itself. \n\nSeeking reality requires immense energy. \n\nIf a person does not seek truth, energy becomes destructive. \n\nSociety controls those who waste energy. \n\nWhen you truly want to do something, you find energy. \n\nThis energy controls itself without outside discipline. \n\nIn seeking reality, energy creates its own discipline. \n\nThe seeker of reality becomes a good citizen. \n\nConflict wastes energy, whether physical or psychological. \n\nMost are taught to struggle and make effort. \n\nWe learn to fight evil and control ourselves. \n\nThis struggle leads to conflict and energy waste. \n\nUnderstanding duality helps to reduce conflict. \n\nOnce duality is created, conflict becomes inevitable.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A free mind, liberated from conditioning and conflict, can perceive deeper truths and create its own discipline in the pursuit of reality."
