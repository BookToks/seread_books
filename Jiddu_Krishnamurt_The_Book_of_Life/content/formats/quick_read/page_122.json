  "text": "You may have seen the truth of something immediately.  \n\nThis is perception: seeing truth without analysis or reasoning.  \n\nIt differs from intuition, which we often use carelessly.  \n\nDirect perception requires no reasoning, calculation, or analysis.  \n\nA limited mind cannot perceive truth; it can only reason.  \n\nIf you reflect on yourself, you will understand your commitments.  \n\nYou will see how these commitments limit your freedom.  \n\nWhen you perceive this instantly, you are free.  \n\nPerception is essential for freedom.  \n\nUnderstanding oneself does not come from knowledge or experience.  \n\nAccumulated knowledge prevents further understanding of oneself.  \n\nYou must understand your thinking process to discover new meaning.  \n\nLearning can be an impediment, but not technical knowledge.  \n\nCreative happiness comes from being free of the past.  \n\nClinging to others' experiences shadows the present.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Perception of truth is immediate and essential for freedom, unlike the limitations imposed by reasoning and accumulated knowledge."
