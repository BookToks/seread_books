  "text": "We must understand our process without condemning or justifying. \n\nWithout understanding, confusion and contradiction remain. \n\nCan craving ever be satisfied, or is it endless? \n\nCraving is a burning fire that consumes everything. \n\nAttachment and detachment bind us equally and must be transcended. \n\nIn passion without a cause, there is intensity free of attachment. \n\nPassion with a cause brings attachment, which leads to sorrow. \n\nWe cling to people, beliefs, and ideas. \n\nWhen these attachments fade, we feel empty and insufficient. \n\nWe try to fill this emptiness with new attachments. \n\nRelationship reveals our true selves, like a mirror. \n\nMost dislike what they see and try to change it. \n\nThis desire to change prevents understanding of our current state. \n\nWe often avoid knowing who we are in relationships. \n\nSelf-improvement can blind us to our true selves. \n\nRelationship is painful and shows our everyday existence. \n\nWithout tension, relationship becomes a comfortable illusion. \n\nRecognizing this illusion helps us understand relationships better.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Understanding the process of craving and attachment is essential to transcending confusion and contradiction in relationships."
