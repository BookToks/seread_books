  "text": "The mind swings between the past and the future.  \n\nThe conditioned mind cannot find what lies beyond time.  \n\nIt is shaped by past experiences.  \n\nThe past influences the present and future.  \n\nThis conditioned mind feels conflict and fear.  \n\nIt seeks security beyond time.  \n\nHowever, a mind shaped by time cannot find the timeless.  \n\nBeliefs and attachments create conflict within us.  \n\nWe seek immediate answers to our problems.  \n\nThese answers often prove unsatisfactory.  \n\nUnderstanding the problem can dissolve it.  \n\nA serious mind understands its own psychological structure.  \n\nIt recognizes urges, desires, and frustrations.  \n\nA mind with ongoing problems lacks seriousness.  \n\nWe often distract ourselves with superficial pursuits.  \n\nMany are trapped in routines for survival.  \n\nReligious practices do not guarantee transformation.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The conditioned mind, shaped by the past, struggles to find timelessness and true understanding amidst its conflicts and problems."
