  "text": "The self includes ideas, memories, and intentions.  \n\nIt involves conscious efforts to exist and accumulated unconscious memory.  \n\nThe self encompasses racial, group, and individual identities.  \n\nIt manifests in actions or spiritual virtues.  \n\nStriving for these is the essence of the self.  \n\nThis includes competition and desire.  \n\nThe self is often an evil force, dividing and enclosing us.  \n\nMoments without the self occur in love.  \n\nTruth cannot be recognized through beliefs or knowledge.  \n\nA virtuous person cannot find reality.  \n\nVirtue strengthens the self and covers it.  \n\nBeing poor in beliefs and knowledge is essential.  \n\nRichness in worldly things leads to darkness.  \n\nUnderstanding the self reveals the nature of love.  \n\nLove exists only when the self is absent.  \n\nAn understanding person does not seek beliefs.  \n\nBeliefs arise from the intellect's need for security.  \n\nTo understand reality is more important than ideals.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The self, characterized by memory, intention, and separation, obstructs the experience of love and truth, which can only be realized when the self is absent."
