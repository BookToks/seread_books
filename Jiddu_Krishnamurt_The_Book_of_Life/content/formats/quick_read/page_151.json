  "text": "Free yourself from false values imposed by your environment.  \n\nThere must be utter nakedness for immortality and reality.  \n\nWhat is reincarnation?  \n\nLet us explore what you mean by reincarnation.  \n\nIt is the truth that liberates, not your beliefs or opinions.  \n\nWhen you say, “I shall be reborn,” know what the “I” is.  \n\nIs the “I” a spiritual entity or a thought process?  \n\nIt is either beyond time or within the field of memory.  \n\nLet us discover if the “I” is something spiritual.  \n\nSpiritual means not conditioned or projected by the human mind.  \n\nIs the “I” a spiritual entity?  \n\nIf it is, it cannot be reborn or continued.  \n\nContinuity cannot renew itself; thought cannot know the real.  \n\nTo understand death, we must rid ourselves of fear.  \n\nFear invents theories of afterlife, immortality, and reincarnation.  \n\nIs there such a thing as a soul?  \n\nWe think there is because it gives us pleasure.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The concept of the \"I\" and the soul is explored as potentially being a mere thought process conditioned by time, rather than a true spiritual entity beyond it."
