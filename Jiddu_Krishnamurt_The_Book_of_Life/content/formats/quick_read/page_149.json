  "text": "There is fear of pain. \n\nPhysical pain is a nervous response. \n\nPsychological pain arises from holding onto satisfying things. \n\nI fear losing what I have accumulated. \n\nThese accumulations prevent serious disturbance. \n\nI do not want to be disturbed. \n\nMy fear is of the known. \n\nKnowledge helps prevent pain. \n\nBeliefs also help prevent psychological pain. \n\nI fear losing my beliefs without proof of their reality. \n\nThe “I” is not a spiritual entity. \n\nThought is bound by time and past experiences. \n\nThat which continues cannot discover the real. \n\nOnly that which dies can renew itself. \n\nTo meet death, you must die to everything daily. \n\nA frightened mind cannot love. \n\nFear breeds sorrow and sorrow is time.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Fear of psychological pain arises from attachment to accumulations and beliefs, which prevent renewal and true understanding of self."
