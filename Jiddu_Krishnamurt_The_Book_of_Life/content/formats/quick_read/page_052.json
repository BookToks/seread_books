  "text": "Desire is always present. \n\nIt watches, waits, and pushes us. \n\nYou can deny or accept it, but it remains. \n\nReligious teachings suggest being free from desire. \n\nThis idea is absurd; desire must be understood. \n\nDestroying desire can destroy life itself. \n\nControlling or suppressing desire may harm something beautiful. \n\nWhat if we do not judge desire? \n\nAwareness of desire is important. \n\nMost people condemn and evaluate it. \n\nChoice creates conflict and prevents awareness. \n\nCan you observe desire without judgment? \n\nLiving with desire can reduce turmoil. \n\nDesire should not be destroyed. \n\nPleasure from beauty is natural and good. \n\nMisery arises when we cling to memories of pleasure. \n\nUnderstanding pleasure is essential for clarity. \n\nLife should not be solely about pleasure.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Desire should be understood rather than destroyed, as it is an intrinsic part of life that can lead to conflict if not properly acknowledged."
