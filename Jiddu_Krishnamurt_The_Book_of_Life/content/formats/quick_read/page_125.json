  "text": "The mind has no past experiences as knowledge. \n\nKnowledge is acquired, while learning is a constant movement. \n\nLearning implies that the mind has no authority. \n\nAll knowledge assumes authority, which hinders learning. \n\nThe mind can learn only when it stops accumulating knowledge. \n\nMost people confuse learning with acquiring knowledge. \n\nThe mind accumulates knowledge through experience and reading. \n\nThis accumulation is an acquisitive process. \n\nLearning, as I mean it, is different. \n\nYou learn when you detach from past knowledge. \n\nAn innocent mind perceives instantly and learns continuously. \n\nA mind that acquires knowledge is old and stagnant. \n\nSuch a mind cannot truly learn or grow.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Learning is a continuous, non-acquisitive process that requires an innocent mind free from the authority of past knowledge."
