  "text": "Whether you are guided by emotions or intellect, it leads to despair. \n\nLove is not pleasure or desire. \n\nPleasure comes from dwelling on a feeling. \n\nAmbition gives pleasure, as does seeking power or prestige. \n\nThese pursuits create mischief and lead to war. \n\nEmotions and sentiments do not relate to real affection or compassion. \n\nThey are linked to thought, leading to pleasure and pain. \n\nLove has no pain or sorrow. \n\nThinking is a response to memories of pain or pleasure. \n\nLove differs from emotion and feeling. \n\nLove is fresh, creative, and joyous. \n\nSuch love can be dangerous to society. \n\nWhen you love, you love all of mankind. \n\nLove transcends barriers and cravings for power. \n\nTo experience love, memory must end. \n\nMemory arises from incomplete understanding of experiences. \n\nComplete living is possible only when there is love.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Love is distinct from emotions and desires, as it transcends thought and memory, leading to a deeper, more genuine connection with humanity."
