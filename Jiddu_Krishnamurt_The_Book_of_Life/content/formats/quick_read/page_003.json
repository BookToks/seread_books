  "text": "Listening to yourself is important. \n\nYou may think you understand while listening. \n\nWhen you leave, understanding fades. \n\nYou listen to yourself, not the speaker. \n\nThis creates a hierarchy of authority. \n\nYou see your own picture, not the speaker's. \n\nIf you recognize yourself, you may avoid change. \n\nIf you seek change, you work from your understanding. \n\nListening to yourself brings clarity and sensitivity. \n\nA healthy mind is alive and intense. \n\nThis person can create a new world. \n\nLearning and listening are difficult. \n\nOur minds are not free when we listen. \n\nWe accumulate knowledge without true understanding. \n\nTo learn, you must give your full attention. \n\nLook at a leaf with intensity to learn. \n\nThis applies to everything around you.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Listening requires quietness and full attention to truly understand oneself and the world."
