  "text": "Struggling to become nonviolent is an illusion. \n\nThe ideal is just a different name for what is. \n\nWhen you see this trick, the false becomes clear. \n\nStruggling towards an illusion causes disintegration. \n\nAll conflict and becoming lead to disintegration. \n\nAwareness reveals only what is. \n\nWhen the mind sheds ideals and comparisons, transformation occurs. \n\nNaming creates a relationship between the mind and reality. \n\nWithout naming, what is ceases to exist. \n\nIntegration happens only in this transformation. \n\nThe crude mind cannot become sensitive through effort. \n\nRecognizing crudeness without wanting to change is key. \n\nObservation of crudeness transforms it. \n\nUnderstanding stupidity is more important than trying to be intelligent. \n\nAwareness of stupidity can break its hold. \n\nHierarchical structures hinder true brotherhood. \n\nLove does not allow for divisions or distinctions. \n\nAwareness of lack of love can lead to transformation.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The struggle to achieve ideals and self-improvement often perpetuates disintegration, while true transformation arises from awareness and understanding of one's current state."
