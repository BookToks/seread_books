  "text": "Time and fear are connected.  \n\nTime means moving from what is to what should be.  \n\nWe think time is necessary to be free of fear.  \n\nChanging from what is to what should be involves time.  \n\nTime implies effort in that interval.  \n\nWe struggle between what is and what should be.  \n\nThe idea of what I should be is fictitious.  \n\nWhat I am can change only by understanding time's disorder.  \n\nI can be rid of fear completely, instantly.  \n\nAllowing fear to continue creates disorder.  \n\nTime is an element of disorder, not a solution.  \n\nThere is no gradual process to rid fear or nationalism.  \n\nTime creates division, wars, and misery.  \n\nTime is a poison that creates disorder.  \n\nIf you understand this, you can seek freedom from fear.  \n\nRejecting psychological time may lead to a different understanding.  \n\nThat understanding brings order, not disorder.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Time creates disorder and is a poison that hinders the immediate understanding and freedom from fear."
