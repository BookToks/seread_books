  "text": "Be aware of your conditioning. \n\nYou can only know it in relation to something else. \n\nYou cannot see it as an abstraction. \n\nAwareness comes from conflict. \n\nConflict arises from a lack of integration. \n\nThis conflict stems from our conditioning. \n\nConditioning is attachment to many things. \n\nWithout attachment, there is no conditioning. \n\nWe attach to feel important and escape emptiness. \n\nTo be alone is to resist societal norms. \n\nThis includes all forms of organized power. \n\nOnly a mind that does not belong can be alone. \n\nAloneness brings humility and understanding of love. \n\nAmbition prevents true love and connection. \n\nCraving leads to detachment to avoid suffering. \n\nDetachment and attachment both seek gratification. \n\nWe crave pleasure, security, and wellbeing.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Attachment serves as an escape from one's own emptiness, reinforcing conditioning and conflict."
