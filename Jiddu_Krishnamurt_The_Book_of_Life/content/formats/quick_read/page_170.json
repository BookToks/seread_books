  "text": "There is an extraordinary space in the mind. That space is freedom. \n\nYou must demand freedom from the start. \n\nSeek the significance of freedom in your work and relationships. \n\nMeditation is creation. \n\nCreation is often used too easily. \n\nA painter feels fulfilled by colors on canvas. \n\nEvery writer claims to create, but it is conditioned response. \n\nTrue creation is different. \n\nIt is a mind in a state of creation. \n\nThis state has no cause and is constantly alive. \n\nA still mind does not seek experience. \n\nIn stillness, there is movement of the unknown. \n\nThat movement is timeless and beyond space. \n\nSuch a mind knows true creation, which is love and death. \n\nMeditation requires self-understanding. \n\nYou can only go as far as your own projection. \n\nMeditation lays the foundation for stillness. \n\nThis leads to a mind beyond time and experience.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** True meditation leads to a state of complete stillness and freedom, allowing for a profound understanding of creation beyond societal conditioning."
