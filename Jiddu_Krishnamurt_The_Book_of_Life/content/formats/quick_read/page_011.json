  "text": "Being aware of ourselves reveals the ego and the self. \n\nThe self is complex and can only be uncovered in relationships. \n\nOur daily activities, speech, and judgments reveal our conditioned thinking. \n\nAwareness of this process is important for understanding ourselves. \n\nThrough awareness, we discover the timeless and eternal. \n\nWithout self-knowledge, the eternal is just a word or illusion. \n\nUnderstanding the self leads to the timeless emerging naturally. \n\nThe timeless cannot be sought or acquired; it arises in quietness. \n\nA simple mind, free from judgment and storage, understands reality. \n\nAnalyzing and calculating do not lead to simplicity. \n\nWithout self-knowledge, meditation is impossible. \n\nSelf-knowing involves understanding every thought and feeling. \n\nThought results from conditioning and memory. \n\nMeditation without self-knowledge is deceptive and useless. \n\nUnderstanding self-knowing is crucial for meaningful living. \n\nObservation must be free from interpretation and memory responses. \n\nApproaching with opinions blocks learning and the movement of the mind.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Self-knowledge is essential for understanding the self and achieving a state of meditation, as it reveals the conditioned nature of our thoughts and actions."
