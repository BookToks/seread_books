  "text": "You must look at each individual face, not treat them as a mass.  \n\nThis makes you more alert and understanding.  \n\nYou develop a deeper sense of pity and love.  \n\nIf you do not label feelings, you regard each one as it arises.  \n\nLabeling can alter the feeling or awaken it.  \n\nWithout names, thought does not function through words or symbols.  \n\nThe mind then is not just an observer.  \n\nWhen not thinking in words, the mind is quiet.  \n\nA quiet mind can deal with feelings immediately.  \n\nNaming feelings gives them continuity and strength.  \n\nYou surround feelings with words, which distort them.  \n\nYou struggle with feelings instead of remaining with them.  \n\nTry to stay with feelings like hate or jealousy.  \n\nThis is difficult because the mind rushes in with thoughts.  \n\nCan you observe something without labeling it?  \n\nLiving with feelings without words reveals extraordinary insights.  \n\nVerbalizing is a profound process worth exploring.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Remaining with a feeling without labeling it allows for a deeper understanding and experience of that feeling."
