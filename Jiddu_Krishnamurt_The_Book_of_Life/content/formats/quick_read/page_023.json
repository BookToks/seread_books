  "text": "There is evil in the world. We contribute to both evil and good. \n\nPeople unite more in hate than in goodness. \n\nA wise person understands the causes of good and evil. \n\nThey free thought and feeling from these concepts. \n\nThe current global crisis is exceptional and unprecedented. \n\nPast crises were social, national, or political in nature. \n\nThey came and went, often in modified forms. \n\nNow, we are dealing with ideas, not just money. \n\nWe justify murder as a means to a righteous end. \n\nEvil was once recognized as evil, but now it is justified. \n\nA wrong means cannot produce a right end. \n\nGoodness does not arise from motives or desires. \n\nAttention must be free of motives to be genuine. \n\nA motive creates distraction, not true attention. \n\nGoodness exists only with total attention.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Evil is justified through ideation, leading to a dangerous belief that wrong means can produce right ends."
