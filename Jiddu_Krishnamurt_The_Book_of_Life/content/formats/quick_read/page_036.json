  "text": "Greed does not pay. It seeks to acquire something. \n\nWhen the mind wants to not want, desire remains. \n\nGoodness is not the opposite of evil; it is different. \n\nGoodness has no motive; all motives are egocentric. \n\nAttention has no motive. \n\nIf attention has a motive, it is not true attention. \n\nAttention aimed at acquisition is distraction. \n\nGoodness exists with total attention, without effort. \n\nMust we know drunkenness to understand sobriety? \n\nMust we experience hate to know compassion? \n\nCan the \"me\" evolve from evil to good? \n\nThe psychological \"me\" will always remain evil. \n\nWe hope the \"I\" will become perfect over time. \n\nThe \"I\" is just a bundle of memories and desires. \n\nIf we can think of a higher self, it is still temporal. \n\nThe mind is often occupied with the past. \n\nOur consciousness is rooted in the past. \n\nThe past affects both surface and unconscious levels.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Goodness is a state of total attention without motive, distinct from the duality of good and evil."
