  "text": "People seek happiness for themselves, their families, and society.  \n\nIf they are stopped, they become unhappy.  \n\nThis discussion is not about denying the poor their desires.  \n\nWe are exploring the nature of happiness and awareness of it.  \n\nWhen you recognize happiness, is it truly happiness?  \n\nIf you are conscious of being happy, it is not happiness.  \n\nHappiness cannot be pursued; it comes unexpectedly.  \n\nIf you seek it, happiness will evade you.  \n\nMind cannot find happiness like it finds sensations.  \n\nSensation can be repeated, but happiness cannot be found.  \n\nRemembered happiness is just a reaction to the past.  \n\nThe past is not happiness; it is only sensation.  \n\nRecognition of happiness is not happiness itself.  \n\nConflict arises from memory, preventing true happiness.  \n\nThought breeds conflict, and conflict is not happiness.  \n\nWe often seek happiness through things, relationships, and ideas.  \n\nThese pursuits can distract us from true happiness.  \n\nImpermanence of things leads to unhappiness.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Happiness cannot be pursued or found through external means, as it is a by-product of self-awareness and cannot exist alongside conflict or memory."
