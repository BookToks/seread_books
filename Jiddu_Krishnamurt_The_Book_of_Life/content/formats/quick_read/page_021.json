  "text": "The world is close to catastrophe. \n\nMany seek shelter in ideology. \n\nWe believe ideology can solve the crisis. \n\nIdeology impedes direct relationships and action. \n\nWe desire peace as an idea, not a reality. \n\nPeace exists only when confusion ceases. \n\nWe focus on ideas, not on actual peace. \n\nWe seek new patterns, not true peace. \n\nThis search leads to past-conditioned answers. \n\nKnowledge and experience create conflict with the present. \n\nThe past must conflict with present facts. \n\nThis perpetuates the problems we face. \n\nAction arises from thought, which is conditioned. \n\nMemory is only alive when challenged. \n\nAll memory is conditioned and rooted in the past. \n\nWe must discover if we can act without ideas. \n\nActing without ideas is the way of love.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Ideology hinders direct action and perpetuates conflict, while true peace and love require abandoning ideas and facing reality."
