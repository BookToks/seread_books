  "text": "You can perceive something in an astonishing way. \n\nHave you really perceived a flower, a face, or the sky? \n\nYou see these things as you pass by in a vehicle. \n\nBut have you ever truly looked at a flower? \n\nWhen you look at a flower, you name it. \n\nYou think about its species or its lovely colors. \n\nYour mind starts chattering, and you miss the flower. \n\nYou perceive only when your mind is silent. \n\nLooking at the evening star without thought reveals beauty. \n\nBeauty and love are intertwined; one cannot exist without the other. \n\nBeauty exists in form, speech, and conduct. \n\nWithout love, conduct is empty and lifeless. \n\nWhen the mind perceives without disturbance, it sees deeply. \n\nThis perception is timeless and cannot be forced. \n\nThe mind must be straight and free of conditioning. \n\nKnowledge can divert the mind and create confusion. \n\nOnly an innocent mind can discover deeper truths.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** True perception occurs when the mind is silent and free from conditioning, allowing for the experience of beauty and love."
