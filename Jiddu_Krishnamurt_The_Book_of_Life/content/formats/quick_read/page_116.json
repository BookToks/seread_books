  "text": "We think we are intellectual.  \n\nMost of us have developed so-called intellectual capacities.  \n\nWe read many books filled with others' ideas and theories.  \n\nWe believe we are intellectual if we can quote many authors.  \n\nFew of us have original intellectual concepts.  \n\nCultivating intellect often leads to losing other feelings.  \n\nWe struggle to balance our lives with intellectual reasoning.  \n\nWe should see things as they are, not just offer opinions.  \n\nThis is our difficulty: the inability to see both outward and inward life.  \n\nA competitive mind cannot discover the real.  \n\nIntense thought-feeling leads to self-discovery and creativity.  \n\nSelf-discovery frees us from addictions and intellectual complexity.  \n\nAddictions prevent simplicity in life and focus thought.  \n\nDistraction arises from not understanding our thinking-feeling process.  \n\nThe mind creates its own hindrances and illusions.  \n\nTo be free, the mind must be still and silent.  \n\nAll thought becomes a distraction.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Most people mistake their extensive reading and intellectual abilities for true intelligence, losing the capacity for original thought and balance in their lives."
