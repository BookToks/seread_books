  "text": "The question is: Is there truth in religions?  \n\nWe must examine this closely.  \n\nWe do not mean organized religions like Hinduism or Christianity.  \n\nThese are organized beliefs with propaganda and compulsion.  \n\nIs there truth in organized religion?  \n\nIt may contain truth, but it is not true itself.  \n\nOrganized religion separates people from each other.  \n\nYou are a Muslim, I am a Hindu, and we argue.  \n\nThis is not the pursuit of truth.  \n\nWe believe being part of a religion leads to God.  \n\nTo find God, there must be virtue and freedom.  \n\nBeliefs provide security, comfort, and guidance.  \n\nHowever, ideals can hinder understanding and action.  \n\nReligious organizations become rigid and obstruct change.  \n\nThe search for truth is individual, not congregational.  \n\nSmall informed groups could discuss reality better.  \n\nTo climb high, one must begin low.  \n\nThis small beginning can create a better world.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Organized religion is false and hinders the pursuit of truth, separating individuals and fostering conflict rather than understanding."
