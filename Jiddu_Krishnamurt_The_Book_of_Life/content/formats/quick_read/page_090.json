  "text": "Most of us want happiness. \n\nWe pursue leaders, religious organizations, and teachers. \n\nAre we seeking happiness or gratification? \n\nThere is a difference between the two. \n\nYou can find gratification, but not happiness. \n\nHappiness is a by-product of something else. \n\nWe must understand what we are seeking. \n\nVery few of us truly enjoy anything. \n\nWe superficially admire sunsets, moons, and beauty. \n\nAs we age, we seek different sensations. \n\nPassions, lust, and power are superficial desires. \n\nThey should be understood, not condemned. \n\nTo know joy, one must go deeper. \n\nJoy requires refinement of the mind. \n\nLife becomes petty without understanding joy. \n\nHappiness cannot be pursued. \n\nHappiness is often linked to getting what we want.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Happiness is a by-product of deeper understanding and cannot be pursued through mere gratification or the attainment of desires."
