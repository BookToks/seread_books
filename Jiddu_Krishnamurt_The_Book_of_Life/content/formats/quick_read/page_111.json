  "text": "when the observer is no longer apart from the observed, there is freedom.  \n\nIs there an observer watching loneliness?  \n\nMy mind observes loneliness and avoids it.  \n\nIf I do not run away, is there separation?  \n\nIs there only a state of loneliness, my mind being empty?  \n\nThe observer is not separate from the observed.  \n\nThe mind creates envy, so it cannot change it.  \n\nBy staying with loneliness, is there a difference?  \n\nCan the mind be aware of its emptiness?  \n\nCan it put away dependence and be completely empty?  \n\nIn that state, is there freedom from all attachment?  \n\nWhat is accumulated is not truth.  \n\nTruth cannot be remembered or stored.  \n\nDesire creates the experiencer and separates thought.  \n\nAwareness of desire leads to self-knowledge.  \n\nImmediate action occurs without thought interference.  \n\nThought creates separation between the observer and the observed.  \n\nUnderstanding this separation is crucial for insight.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The observer and the observed are not separate; true understanding arises when one fully experiences a state without division."
