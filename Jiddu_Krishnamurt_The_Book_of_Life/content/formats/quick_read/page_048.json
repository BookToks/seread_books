  "text": "Freedom from fear brings understanding and clarity.  \n\nThis clarity helps in pursuing the real.  \n\nAre we afraid of facts or ideas about facts?  \n\nFor instance, are we afraid of death itself or the idea of death?  \n\nThe fact of death is one thing; the idea is another.  \n\nFear arises from our ideas, not from the fact.  \n\nIf I commune with the fact, I find no fear.  \n\nFear exists when I hold opinions or theories about the fact.  \n\nUnderstanding the word requires examining what it implies.  \n\nMy opinions and experiences create fear.  \n\nVerbalizing facts leads to identification and judgment, which breeds fear.  \n\nThought, a product of the past, translates facts into fear.  \n\nPhysical fear is natural, like seeing a snake.  \n\nPsychological fear arises from the desire for certainty.  \n\nDirect contact with fear eliminates the observer-observed division.  \n\nIn this contact, there is no fear or separation.  \n\nThis separation breeds competition and ambition.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Freedom from fear allows for true understanding and clarity in facing reality."
