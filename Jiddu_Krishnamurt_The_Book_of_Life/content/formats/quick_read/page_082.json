  "text": "Attention cannot be cultivated through persuasion or coercion. \n\nEliminating fear is the first step to attention. \n\nFear exists with the urge to succeed. \n\nYou can teach concentration, but not attention. \n\nUnderstanding causes helps eliminate fear. \n\nAttention arises spontaneously in a secure atmosphere. \n\nIt comes with feelings of ease and love. \n\nLove does not compare, so envy ceases. \n\nHumility cannot be practiced if you seek recognition. \n\nThere is no place to arrive; there is only learning. \n\nArriving leads to dissatisfaction and frustration. \n\nA listening mind seeks no results; it unfolds naturally. \n\nAwareness observes without condemnation or acceptance. \n\nTotal awareness requires facing facts without background noise. \n\nKnowledge can hinder total perception of a fact. \n\nTo be aware, one must recognize their conditioning. \n\nAwareness focuses on facts, not the background.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Attention arises spontaneously in an atmosphere of well-being, free from fear and the urge to become."
