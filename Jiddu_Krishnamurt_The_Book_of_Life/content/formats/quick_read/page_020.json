  "text": "Do ideas dull the mind?  \n\nA clever mind may quote many things.  \n\nBut a mind that quotes a lot is dull.  \n\nLiving with the fact removes conflict.  \n\nThis liberates energy to face the fact.  \n\nContradiction traps the mind.  \n\nI want to do this, yet I do something else.  \n\nFacing the fact removes contradiction.  \n\nThen my mind focuses on understanding what is.  \n\nExperiencing requires a mind free from ideas.  \n\nIdeas are not truth; truth must be experienced.  \n\nExperiences based on ideas are merely sensations.  \n\nAction based on thought is conditioned and isolated.  \n\nIdeas oppose each other and create gaps.  \n\nAction based on belief is fragmented.  \n\nCan action exist without thought?  \n\nIdeas may limit action instead of producing it.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Action can only be truly effective when it is free from the limitations and separations imposed by ideas and beliefs."
