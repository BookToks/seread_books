  "text": "A passionate mind seeks and breaks through. \n\nIt does not accept tradition. \n\nIt is not a decided mind. \n\nIt is a young mind that is always arriving. \n\nA petty mind cannot create this passion. \n\nA petty mind reduces everything to its own pettiness. \n\nPassion arises when the mind sees its own pettiness. \n\nA small mind may achieve skills but remains small. \n\nIts passion will be limited and trivial. \n\nMost people have lost their passion. \n\nSociety suppresses this passion. \n\nPeople adjust to a dead, respectable life. \n\nIn passion without a cause, there is intensity. \n\nWith a cause, there is attachment. \n\nAttachment leads to sorrow.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A passionate mind is one that is constantly seeking and evolving, free from tradition and attachment."
