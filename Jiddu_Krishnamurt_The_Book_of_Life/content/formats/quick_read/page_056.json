  "text": "We know love as a sensation. \n\nWhen we say we love, we feel jealousy and fear. \n\nLove implies envy, possession, and the fear of loss. \n\nWe call this love, but we do not know true love. \n\nTrue love is without fear, envy, and possession. \n\nWe are jealous and possessive in our relationships. \n\nWe only think of loved ones when they are gone. \n\nWe miss them when we suffer or feel disturbed. \n\nPossession prevents us from truly thinking about love. \n\nThinking arises from disturbance, not from love. \n\nLove is not a mental construct; it is pure. \n\nJealousy and ambition fill our hearts, blocking love. \n\nWhen there is love, there is no duty. \n\nLove means sharing everything with your partner. \n\nDuties arise when there is no love. \n\nExamine your heart; you may find no love. \n\nRights and duties replace love in society.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Love is often confused with possessiveness, jealousy, and duty, which obscures its true essence."
