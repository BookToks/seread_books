  "text": "Can you do that? \n\nWe are afraid and lazy. \n\nWe think, “Why bother? It is too difficult.” \n\nWe postpone action repeatedly. \n\nYou must see the truth of continuation and modification. \n\nPerception of truth is immediate, not bound by time. \n\nCan the mind break through instantly? \n\nCan it see the barrier of the word in a flash? \n\nYou have experienced this, but it is rare. \n\nUnderstanding comes when the mind is still. \n\nCultivating stillness leads to a dead mind. \n\nInterest and intention make the mind clear and free. \n\nVerbalization then ceases, allowing for true understanding. \n\nChattering minds cannot grasp subtle truth. \n\nTruth is not abstract; it is difficult to follow. \n\nA mind caught in words cannot understand truth. \n\nWe are conditioned, and all thought is partial. \n\nTotal comprehension is necessary to break conditioning.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The mind's understanding of truth is hindered by its conditioning and the interference of words, requiring stillness to perceive reality directly."
