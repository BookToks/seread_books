  "text": "Thought is verbalized sensation.  \n\nIt is the response of memory, words, experience, and images.  \n\nThought is transient, changing, and impermanent.  \n\nYet, it seeks permanency.  \n\nThought creates the thinker, who becomes permanent.  \n\nThe thinker assumes roles like censor and guide.  \n\nThis permanent entity is an illusion created by thought.  \n\nWithout thought, the thinker does not exist.  \n\nThe thinker consists of qualities that cannot be separated.  \n\nThe controller is the controlled, playing a deceptive game.  \n\nTruth is not seen until the false is recognized.  \n\nFusion of thinker and thoughts cannot occur through will or effort.  \n\nIt happens only when the mind is utterly still.  \n\nFreedom from conditioning is necessary for understanding.  \n\nAgitated thoughts prevent understanding.  \n\nTruth comes unexpectedly in moments of openness.  \n\nAvoid building a wall of impregnable thought.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Thought creates a false sense of permanence and division between the thinker and thoughts, which must be transcended to achieve true understanding and freedom."
