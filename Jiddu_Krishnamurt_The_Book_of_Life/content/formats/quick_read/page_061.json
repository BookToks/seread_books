  "text": "For most of us, passion relates only to sex. \n\nWe either suffer or try to resolve that suffering. \n\nI use passion as a state of mind and being. \n\nIt is a strong feeling, highly sensitive to everything. \n\nThis includes dirt, squalor, poverty, and corruption. \n\nIt also includes beauty, like trees, birds, and water. \n\nFeeling intensely is necessary for a meaningful life. \n\nWithout passion, life becomes empty and shallow. \n\nIf you cannot love a tree, you are not living. \n\nYou cannot be sensitive without passion. \n\nMany say to avoid passion, but that limits sensitivity. \n\nPassion allows us to feel beauty and ugliness. \n\nLove is a state without “me” or condemnation. \n\nWithout passion, how can one truly love? \n\nA passionate mind seeks and inquires. \n\nThis passion is not just sexual; it encompasses everything. \n\nWe must revive our passion for a fulfilling life.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Passion is essential for a meaningful life, as it fosters sensitivity to both beauty and suffering beyond mere sexual desire."
