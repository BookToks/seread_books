  "text": "Truth is not for respectable people or those seeking fulfillment.  \n\nIt is not for those who desire security or permanency.  \n\nThe permanency they seek is the opposite of impermanency.  \n\nThey are caught in time, seeking what is not real.  \n\nA man must cease to seek to discover reality.  \n\nThis does not mean he must accept what is.  \n\nHe must be a complete revolutionary inwardly.  \n\nHe cannot belong to any class, nation, or ideology.  \n\nTruth is not found in temples or churches.  \n\nIt arises when the mind and hand are set aside.  \n\nThis setting aside is not a matter of time.  \n\nTruth comes to those free of time and memory.  \n\nTo be free, one must escape nationalism and organized beliefs.  \n\nA fresh mind can create a new world.  \n\nHearing truth without action can lead to poison.  \n\nUnderstanding what is actual requires close attention.  \n\nDistraction arises from thinking not based on facts.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Truth cannot be discovered by those seeking security or belonging, but requires a revolutionary mindset free from all ideologies and attachments."
