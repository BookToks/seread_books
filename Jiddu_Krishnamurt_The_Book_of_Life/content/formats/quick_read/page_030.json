  "text": "with the problems relationships create, understanding love is essential.  \n\nA mind that understands love can grasp reality.  \n\nLife is often ugly, painful, and sorrowful.  \n\nWe seek theories or doctrines to explain this.  \n\nBeliefs become rooted due to fear of the unknown.  \n\nWe avoid examining this fear.  \n\nStronger beliefs lead to stronger dogmas.  \n\nBeliefs, like Christianity or Buddhism, divide people.  \n\nEach belief has rituals that bind and separate us.  \n\nBelief is corrupt because it empowers the self.  \n\nReligion is often seen as belief in God.  \n\nNot believing can lead to societal condemnation.  \n\nBoth believers and non-believers face judgment.  \n\nBelief limits the mind and hinders freedom.  \n\nTrue understanding comes from freedom, not belief.  \n\nBelief serves as a screen between us and our problems.  \n\nReligion becomes an escape from confusion.  \n\nThose who believe may still act in harmful ways.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Belief acts as a screen that separates individuals and prevents them from confronting their confusion and understanding reality."
