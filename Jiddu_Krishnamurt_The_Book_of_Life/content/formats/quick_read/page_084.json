  "text": "If awareness becomes a habit, it becomes tedious and painful.  \n\nAwareness cannot be disciplined or practiced.  \n\nPractice implies habit, effort, and will.  \n\nEffort distorts true awareness.  \n\nAwareness includes both outer and inner experiences.  \n\nYou observe the beauty of a bird in flight.  \n\nHowever, you often condemn or justify your inner conflict.  \n\nYou struggle to observe your inward strife without bias.  \n\nBeing aware of thoughts and feelings without identification is freeing.  \n\nSeeking results increases conflict and tedium.  \n\nAwareness takes in everything around you.  \n\nIt involves observing shapes, colors, and actions.  \n\nTotal awareness encompasses your entire being.  \n\nFragmented awareness leads to a limited mind.  \n\nLetting thoughts and feelings flower requires attention, not concentration.  \n\nFreedom and light are essential for flowering thoughts.  \n\nJudgment limits the flowering of thought.  \n\nThis flowering can lead to the ending of thought.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Awareness, when practiced as a habit, becomes tedious and painful, as it involves effort and distortion rather than the natural observation of thoughts and feelings."
