  "text": "Intelligence has the capacity to feel and reason.  \n\nBoth capacities exist together, harmoniously.  \n\nBringing emotions into business can lead to poor management.  \n\nPeople compartmentalize their lives into emotions, business, and religion.  \n\nBusiness often becomes a way to make money for living.  \n\nThis division creates a chaotic existence.  \n\nUsing intelligence in business may lead to failure.  \n\nYou might let it fail when you see the absurdity of this life.  \n\nUntil you approach life with intelligence, toil for survival persists.  \n\nSentiment and emotion have no place in love.  \n\nThey are reactions of like or dislike.  \n\nSentiment breeds cruelty, leading to actions like killing for a flag.  \n\nJealousy and envy are not love.  \n\nTo experience love, we must eliminate these emotions.  \n\nEmotions, like hate and devotion, are sensations and responses.  \n\nLove is not memory; it is often misunderstood.  \n\nMost of us equate love with memory.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Intelligence harmonizes emotion and reasoning, while sentiment and emotion can lead to cruelty and division in life."
