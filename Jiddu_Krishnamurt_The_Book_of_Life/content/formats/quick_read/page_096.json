  "text": "Sorrow includes grief, uncertainty, and loneliness.  \n\nIt encompasses death, unfulfilled potential, and lack of recognition.  \n\nIt also includes loving without being loved in return.  \n\nUnderstanding sorrow is essential to ending conflict and misery.  \n\nThere are two types of sorrow: conscious and unconscious.  \n\nConscious sorrow has immediate causes, and we know it well.  \n\nWe often run from it through beliefs or distractions.  \n\nYet, we cannot escape conscious sorrow completely.  \n\nUnconscious sorrow is inherited and persists despite superficial happiness.  \n\nEnding sorrow means addressing both conscious and unconscious forms.  \n\nA clear and simple mind is necessary to end sorrow.  \n\nSimplicity requires intelligence and sensitivity.  \n\nWe should seek truth rather than avoid disturbing others.  \n\nRespecting othersâ€™ feelings may stem from fear of hurt.  \n\nQuestion differing opinions to discover their truth.  \n\nDisturbances may arise, but truth is more important.  \n\nWe must decide whether to comply or seek truth.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Understanding sorrow, both conscious and unconscious, is essential to ending conflict and achieving true compassion and love."
