  "text": "Outwardly, authority comes from society, family, and religion.  \n\nIgnoring authority is not very significant.  \n\nBreaking one tradition to follow another is superficial.  \n\nWe must understand the whole process of authority.  \n\nWe need awareness and insight to transcend the desire for certainty.  \n\nWe must be free from authority at the beginning, not the end.  \n\nWe listen with hope and fear.  \n\nWe seek liberation but often remain passive.  \n\nIf the liberated fulfills our desires, we accept them.  \n\nSelf-knowledge is essential for liberation from ignorance and sorrow.  \n\nWe follow others out of craving for authority.  \n\nThis search for authority can lead to disillusionment.  \n\nUnderstanding our craving helps us comprehend doubt.  \n\nAuthority corrupts both leaders and followers.  \n\nIt breeds thoughtlessness and pain.  \n\nThe conflict within yourself is what truly matters.  \n\nAuthority diverts you from this inner conflict.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Merely rejecting authority without understanding its deeper implications is superficial and does not lead to true liberation or self-knowledge."
