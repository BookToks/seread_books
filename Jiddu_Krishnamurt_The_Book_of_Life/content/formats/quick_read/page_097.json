  "text": "Why divide problems into major and minor? \n\nIsn't everything a problem? \n\nWhy classify them as essential or unessential? \n\nIf we understand one problem deeply, we uncover all problems. \n\nThis is not just a rhetorical question. \n\nTake anger, jealousy, or envy. \n\nIf you explore anger deeply, what do you find? \n\nYou are angry because you feel hurt. \n\nSomeone has said something unkind. \n\nSelf-importance causes this hurt. \n\nWhy do we have self-importance? \n\nIt comes from our ideas and images of ourselves. \n\nWe create these images because we don't study who we are. \n\nWhen our ideals are attacked, we feel anger. \n\nObserving the truth of who we are prevents hurt. \n\nJudgment and fear must not cloud this observation.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Understanding any problem deeply reveals the interconnectedness of all issues, as they stem from our self-image and reactions to reality."
