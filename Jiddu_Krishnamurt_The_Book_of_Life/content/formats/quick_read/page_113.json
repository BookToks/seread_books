  "text": "Being hungry is a fact. \n\nThere is no idea about being hungry. \n\nYou think about what to eat. \n\nThen you eat according to pleasure. \n\nAction occurs when there is no idea of what to do. \n\nUnderstanding what is leads to being virtuous. \n\nBecoming virtuous is merely postponing action. \n\nThis avoids facing what is directly. \n\nVirtue is understanding what is and finding freedom from it. \n\nIt is essential in a disintegrating society. \n\nTo understand a child, you must love him. \n\nYou must observe his behavior without condemnation. \n\nUnderstanding what is requires observing thoughts and feelings. \n\nAmbition drives conflict and confusion. \n\nSelf-assertion causes much of our struggle. \n\nRunning away from what is brings sorrow. \n\nConflict arises from denying what is.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Virtue arises from understanding and confronting what is, rather than avoiding it through ideals."
