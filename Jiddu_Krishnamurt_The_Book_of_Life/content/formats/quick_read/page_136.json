  "text": "Our education cultivates memory. \n\nMass communication occurs through journals, radio, and television. \n\nProfessors repeat lectures until students memorize everything. \n\nStudents regurgitate this information during exams for degrees. \n\nThen, they enter jobs and routines filled with repetition. \n\nAmbition creates an inward struggle and frustration. \n\nPeople compete for jobs and seek closeness to God. \n\nPressure and stress crowd our minds with influences and sorrow. \n\nWe wear down the mind instead of using it. \n\nUnderstanding the old brain is important. \n\nThe old brain cannot understand the new brain. \n\nWhen the old brain is quiet, clarity emerges. \n\nMeditation helps us understand the old brain's operations. \n\nAwareness of its movements and demands is essential. \n\nConstant striving ages the mind prematurely. \n\nA young mind remains uncontaminated by lifeâ€™s struggles. \n\nAn old mind is burdened by memories and decisions. \n\nA young mind is alive and always deciding.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Our education often focuses on memorization and repetition, leading to a crowded and worn-out mind that struggles to understand deeper clarity."
