  "text": "Renunciation is not a gesture of greatness. \n\nWe possess because we fear not being. \n\nPossessions vary widely among people. \n\nSome attach to knowledge, ideas, or virtue. \n\nWithout possessions, the “me” does not exist. \n\nThe “me” is defined by possessions and values. \n\nFear of not being leads to attachment. \n\nWhen possessions become painful, we seek better ones. \n\nThe ultimate possession is often God or the State. \n\nBeing unwilling to be nothing breeds sorrow. \n\nWillingness to be nothing brings freedom. \n\nSeeing truth leads to wisdom and love. \n\nExploitation exists in our desire for power. \n\nTo exploit is to be exploited in return. \n\nDependence makes us possessive and holds us back. \n\nWithout possession, we feel empty and unimportant. \n\nAttachment is unavoidable; detachment is an illusion.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The \"me\" is defined by possessions and attachments, and true freedom comes from recognizing the illusion of these attachments rather than renouncing them."
