  "text": "When there is love, the self does not exist.  \n\nTruth cannot be recognized through belief or knowledge.  \n\nTo find truth, virtue and the pursuit of virtue must cease.  \n\nA virtuous person cannot find reality or understand truth.  \n\nVirtue strengthens the self and covers its true nature.  \n\nA man rich in worldly possessions or beliefs knows only darkness.  \n\nUnderstanding the self reveals what love truly is.  \n\nLove is the only force that can change the world.  \n\nA man who understands life does not want beliefs.  \n\nLove exists beyond beliefs and ideals, which are false.  \n\nTo understand reality, one must confront what is false.  \n\nOnly by seeing the false can the true be perceived.  \n\nWithout recognizing ignorance, enlightenment remains unattainable.  \n\nSeeing the false leads to truth, ecstasy, and happiness.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Love cannot coexist with the self, and true understanding requires the dissolution of beliefs and the recognition of falsehoods."
