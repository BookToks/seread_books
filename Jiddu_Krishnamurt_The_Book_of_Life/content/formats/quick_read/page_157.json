  "text": "Compassion comes easily when the heart is free of cunning. \n\nThe mind's fears and demands destroy love. \n\nSimplicity in this matter is difficult. \n\nYou donâ€™t need doctrines to be kind. \n\nThe powerful will organize to help people. \n\nThis is inevitable with increased production. \n\nBut organization lacks true generosity. \n\nGenerosity comes from a different source. \n\nAmbition and envy destroy generosity. \n\nOne must approach this source empty-handed. \n\nBooks and gurus cannot lead to it. \n\nSerenity without movement reveals this source. \n\nAloneness has great beauty. \n\nLoneliness feels completely isolated. \n\nTo be alone means something different. \n\nTrue beauty and energy come from being alone. \n\nWalls of nationalism and class breed loneliness. \n\nA lonely mind cannot understand true religion.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Compassion arises from a serene mind free of the complexities of thought, while true aloneness reveals beauty and energy beyond societal constructs."
