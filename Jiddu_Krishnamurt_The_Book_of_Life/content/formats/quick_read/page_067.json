  "text": "What is feeling? \n\nFeeling is like thought. \n\nIt is a sensation. \n\nI see a flower and respond. \n\nI like or dislike it. \n\nMy thoughts dictate my feelings. \n\nLove is related to feeling. \n\nFeeling includes sensations of like and dislike. \n\nHave you observed your surroundings? \n\nPassion is often denied by saints. \n\nThey avoid sensation to escape desire. \n\nUnderstanding feeling leads to understanding love. \n\nSeeing beauty in nature reveals love. \n\nWhen you observe a feeling, it ends. \n\nAn observer creates contradiction. \n\nLabeling feelings brings them into the old framework. \n\nWithout naming, you realize you are one with the feeling. \n\nThere is no separate \"you.\"\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Understanding the totality of feeling is essential to truly knowing what love is, as it transcends mere sensations of like and dislike."
