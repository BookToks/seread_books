  "text": "By seeking security in relationships, you hinder their function.  \n\nRelationships reveal the state of one's whole being.  \n\nThey are a process of self-revelation and self-knowledge.  \n\nThis self-revelation is painful and demands constant adjustment.  \n\nMost avoid the tension in relationships for comfort and ease.  \n\nThey seek unchallenged security and safe anchorage.  \n\nFamily becomes a refuge for thoughtless individuals.  \n\nWhen insecurity creeps in, relationships are cast aside.  \n\nThere is no security in relationships, and dependency breeds fear.  \n\nWithout understanding security and fear, relationships hinder growth.  \n\nExistence becomes struggle and pain without right thinking.  \n\nReal love cannot exist between mere images and symbols.  \n\nRelationships are shaped by images created from experiences.  \n\nTo understand relationships, one must have passive awareness.  \n\nThis awareness makes relationships vital and significant.  \n\nWe are defined by what we possess and identify with.  \n\nPossession shapes our identity and understanding of self.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Seeking security in relationships hinders their true function of self-revelation and understanding, leading to dependency and fear rather than genuine connection."
