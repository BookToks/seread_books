  "text": "The man who sees life totally is out of time.  \n\nThis relates to our daily existence.  \n\nUnderstanding this helps with routine, boredom, and sorrow.  \n\nIt addresses our anxieties and fears.  \n\nOne can cut the cord of misery immediately.  \n\nHas it happened to you that you suddenly perceive something?  \n\nIn that moment, you have no problems at all.  \n\nWhen you perceive a problem, it ceases.  \n\nYou think and worry about the problem, but find no answer.  \n\nEventually, you leave the problem alone.  \n\nYour mind becomes quiet, and in that quietness, you find answers.  \n\nThis happens to mathematicians, scientists, and in everyday life.  \n\nThe mind reaches the edge of thought and becomes quiet.  \n\nThis quietness brings awareness without anxiety.  \n\nThis perception resolves our problems.  \n\nGreat seers say experience gives understanding.  \n\nBut only an innocent mind can perceive reality.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Understanding life requires a perception that transcends time and experience, allowing for immediate clarity and resolution of problems."
