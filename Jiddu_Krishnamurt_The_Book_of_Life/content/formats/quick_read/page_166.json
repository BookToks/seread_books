  "text": "A mind burdened with information struggles to experience the new. \n\nIt finds it hard to let go of accumulated knowledge. \n\nWhen the mind sets aside all it knows, it becomes free. \n\nNo teachers, religions, or quotes remain in this state. \n\nOnly then can a profound change occur. \n\nA true religious person is alone and not attached to beliefs. \n\nSaying \"I do not know\" shows humility and ends arrogance. \n\nThis state stops all fear and inquiry into the known. \n\nWhen conditioning stops, the mind enters a new state. \n\nWe seek permanence in a transient world. \n\nThe sacred exists beyond time and the known. \n\nThought arises from memory and cannot find the eternal. \n\nSelf-knowledge reveals the roots of all thoughts. \n\nWhen faced with a problem, the mind can say, \"I do not know.\" \n\nBelief in God or disbelief is unnecessary for true understanding. \n\nAwareness transcends all limitations of belief. \n\nThis awareness leads to something real and beyond illusions.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** True understanding and spiritual awakening require letting go of accumulated knowledge and beliefs, embracing a state of humility and not-knowing."
