  "text": "What is important is not how to be free of fear. \n\nIf you seek a method to be rid of fear, you remain trapped. \n\nUnderstanding fear requires direct contact with it. \n\nThis is similar to feeling hunger or job loss. \n\nOnly then can all fear cease. \n\nFear is the non-acceptance of what is. \n\nFear finds escapes through identification. \n\nWe identify with country, society, or ideas. \n\nIn danger, we connect with our country or ideology. \n\nThis identification leads to self-forgetfulness. \n\nWhen I focus on “me,” I feel pain and fear. \n\nIdentifying with something greater offers temporary escape. \n\nFear is the non-acceptance of what is. \n\nAcceptance comes from perceiving clearly what is. \n\nTime creates disorder by moving from what is to what should be. \n\nEffort arises from conflict between what is and what should be. \n\nUnderstanding this disorder is essential for change.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Understanding fear requires direct contact with it, rather than seeking methods to escape it."
