  "text": "What we call love is a mental concept.  \n\nLook at your lives and relationships.  \n\nIf love were different, society would change.  \n\nWe bind ourselves through contracts, not fusion.  \n\nLove is a state of being, not personal or impersonal.  \n\nDesiring fusion avoids confusion, but the mind remains separate.  \n\nLove is neither fusion nor diffusion; it cannot be found by the mind.  \n\nThe mind must be quiet to know love.  \n\nIn marriage, love implies companionship and union.  \n\nWithout love, marriage becomes mere gratification.  \n\nLove exists only when the self is absent.  \n\nWithout love, relationships lead to pain and boredom.  \n\nChastity requires love; celibacy alone is not purity.  \n\nPursuing ideals excludes love and leads to misery.  \n\nLove cannot be adjusted or formulated.  \n\nWithout love, we merely adjust in marriage.  \n\nThis adjustment creates conflict and fails to foster love.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** What we call love is a mental construct that often leads to conflict and adjustment rather than true connection."
