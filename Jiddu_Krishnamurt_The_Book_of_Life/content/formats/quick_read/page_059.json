  "text": "Those who seek celibacy for God are unchaste.  \n\nThey seek a result, substituting fear for sex.  \n\nTheir hearts lack love, so they cannot find purity.  \n\nOnly a pure heart can discover reality.  \n\nA disciplined or suppressed heart cannot know love.  \n\nIt is trapped in habits and sensations.  \n\nThe idealist imitates and cannot truly love.  \n\nGenerosity and compassion lead to love.  \n\nChaste love arises when the heart is free.  \n\nPunishing oneself is not a religious life.  \n\nSelf-torture does not lead to understanding.  \n\nChastity is not denial or renunciation.  \n\nThe means matter more than the end.  \n\nTruth cannot be bought or attained through sacrifice.  \n\nChastity cannot lead to liberation or truth.  \n\nChastity exists only with love; without love, it is lust.  \n\nTo be chaste is to transform oneself.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Chastity arises from love, not from suppression or the pursuit of results."
