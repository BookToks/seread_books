  "text": "We need your attention, not your agreement. \n\nWe are examining life clearly and objectively. \n\nOur likes and dislikes create our misery. \n\nWe ask, \"How do we end fear?\" \n\nThis is a crucial problem. \n\nWithout ending fear, one lives in darkness. \n\nThere must be a way out, not through hope. \n\nCan we end fear completely? \n\nYou may not have considered this question. \n\nIf you do, focus on understanding fear's nature. \n\nWhen you understand fear, it ends naturally. \n\nThe observer is the observed when aware. \n\nThere is no difference between them. \n\nWhen fear is observed directly, there is action. \n\nThis action is not from the observer. \n\nThe division between observer and observed creates conflict. \n\nConflict brings urgency and sorrow.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To end fear and sorrow, one must understand the duality between the observer and the observed, as this division creates conflict and time."
