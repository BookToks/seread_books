  "text": "We act like machines in our daily routines. \n\nThe mind eagerly accepts and clings to patterns. \n\nIt is held together by ideas, which define its existence. \n\nThe mind is never free; it is always anchored. \n\nIt moves within its own narrow or wide center. \n\nWhen it wanders, it is lost in fear. \n\nFear comes from losing the known, not from the unknown. \n\nDesire is always linked to fear of having more or less. \n\nThe mind creates time, which brings fear, hope, and death. \n\nThe mind is influenced constantly to think in certain ways. \n\nGovernments now shape and control our thoughts. \n\nThe unconscious holds ambitions, problems, and fears. \n\nWe live in contradiction, struggling between happiness and unhappiness. \n\nWe seek security, yet deep down we know it doesnâ€™t exist. \n\nThe mind exists within a pattern of the past and future. \n\nBreaking the old pattern is essential for transformation. \n\nLiving in the now allows the mind to be free.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The mind is trapped in patterns of thought shaped by time and tradition, hindering true freedom and understanding."
