  "text": "The present forms the memory of \"me\" and \"mine.\"  \n\nThe self is the root of all fear.  \n\nThere is only craving.  \n\nNo separate entity exists from craving.  \n\nCraving wears different masks based on interests.  \n\nMemory of these interests meets the new and creates conflict.  \n\nThis conflict births the chooser, who feels separate from craving.  \n\nHowever, the chooser is not different from its qualities.  \n\nThe one avoiding loneliness is the same as that loneliness.  \n\nHe cannot escape himself; he must understand himself.  \n\nLoneliness and emptiness are part of him.  \n\nBelieving they are separate leads to illusion and conflict.  \n\nExperiencing loneliness directly brings freedom from fear.  \n\nFear exists in relation to an idea formed by memory.  \n\nThought cannot know emptiness directly.  \n\nWords and memories block fresh experiences.  \n\nWhen words lose significance, the relationship changes.  \n\nThe experiencer becomes the experience, bringing freedom from fear.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The self, rooted in craving, is the source of all fear and conflict, and true freedom comes from understanding rather than escaping one's desires and loneliness."
