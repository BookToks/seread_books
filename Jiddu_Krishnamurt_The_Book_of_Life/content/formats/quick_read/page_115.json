  "text": "Contentment is not from thought systems.  \n\nIt comes from understanding what is.  \n\nThis contentment is not from a disturbed mind.  \n\nA disturbed mind seeks peace away from what is.  \n\nIt tries to change what is through judgment and comparison.  \n\nThe mind hopes to find peace and quietness.  \n\nWhen disturbed by social conditions, the mind wants to alter them.  \n\nBut if the mind observes without judgment, true contentment arises.  \n\nMind-made contentment is an escape and sterile.  \n\nTrue contentment arises from understanding what is.  \n\nThis understanding can revolutionize society and relationships.  \n\nDiscontent is essential for inquiry and finding truth.  \n\nDiscontent can vanish with comfort and routine.  \n\nWe must keep discontent alive for true probing.  \n\nReligious texts and systems often pacify the mind.  \n\nDiscontent is necessary to discover what is true.  \n\nUnderstanding what is can lead to profound change.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** True contentment arises from understanding reality as it is, rather than seeking to alter it through the mind's disturbances."
