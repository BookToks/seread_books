  "text": "Most people think comparison encourages learning. \n\nHowever, comparison leads to frustration and envy. \n\nIt fosters competition and prevents true learning. \n\nLearning and acquiring knowledge are different processes. \n\nLearning is continuous; it is not about accumulating knowledge. \n\nMany gather knowledge as memory and act from it. \n\nThis approach does not lead to real learning. \n\nLearning is a constant movement, not a storehouse. \n\nWisdom must be discovered personally, not through knowledge. \n\nKnowledge and wisdom do not coexist. \n\nSelf-knowledge is essential for order and virtue. \n\nAcquiring knowledge about oneself is not true learning. \n\nLearning is active and exists only in the present. \n\nOnce you say, “I have learned,” it becomes knowledge. \n\nA mind that learns can understand the self. \n\nTo know oneself, one must be free from past knowledge. \n\nOtherwise, one merely interprets and translates.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Learning is a continuous process that cannot be based on the accumulation of knowledge or past experiences."
