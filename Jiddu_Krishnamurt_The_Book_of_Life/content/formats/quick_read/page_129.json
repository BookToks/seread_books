  "text": "A religious mind is free from all authority.  \n\nIt struggles to be free from external and internal authority.  \n\nThis includes authority from past experiences and traditions.  \n\nThe religious mind has no beliefs or dogmas.  \n\nIt moves from fact to fact.  \n\nThus, the religious mind is the scientific mind.  \n\nHowever, the scientific mind is not necessarily religious.  \n\nThe religious mind considers the totality of human existence.  \n\nThe brain focuses on specialized functions.  \n\nSpecialization creates division both inwardly and outwardly.  \n\nScientists and doctors are currently seen as very important.  \n\nFunction and status become crucial in society.  \n\nSpecialization leads to contradiction and narrowing down.  \n\nThe brain's function is to specialize.  \n\nTime, especially psychological time, does not provide solutions.  \n\nFear breeds disorder within individuals.  \n\nWe must question the idea of evolution in thought.  \n\nIs it possible to be free from fear and psychological time?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A religious mind transcends authority and beliefs, encompassing the totality of human existence, while the scientific mind remains specialized and divided."
