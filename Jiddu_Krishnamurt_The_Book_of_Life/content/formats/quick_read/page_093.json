  "text": "What is the good of asking about happiness when I suffer? \n\nCan I understand suffering? \n\nThat is my problem, not how to be happy. \n\nI am happy when I am not suffering. \n\nThe moment I am conscious of suffering, it is not happiness. \n\nI must understand suffering. \n\nCan I understand suffering if part of my mind seeks happiness? \n\nTo understand suffering, I must be completely one with it. \n\nI should not reject, justify, or compare it. \n\nThe truth of happiness will come if I know how to listen. \n\nI must listen to suffering to understand happiness. \n\nSuffering is suffering, not yours or mine. \n\nAnother manâ€™s suffering is the same as mine. \n\nSuffering is actual and requires great insight to understand. \n\nTo end suffering brings peace within and outside. \n\nWe are indifferent to another's suffering. \n\nUnderstanding suffering makes us sensitive to it.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Understanding suffering is essential to experiencing true happiness, as suffering is a shared human experience that requires deep insight and sensitivity."
