  "text": "To know oneself requires alertness of mind. \n\nWhat is constantly changes and transforms. \n\nThe mind must not cling to dogma or belief. \n\nTethering the mind hinders self-discovery. \n\nAwareness must be free from beliefs and ideals. \n\nBeliefs distort true perception. \n\nTo understand yourself, avoid imagining who you are not. \n\nIdealizing nonviolence or non-greed has little value. \n\nUnderstanding yourself, in any state, begins virtue. \n\nVirtue is essential for freedom. \n\nWithout self-knowledge, experience breeds illusion. \n\nSelf-knowledge reveals the self's intentions and thoughts. \n\nThere is no method for self-knowledge. \n\nSeeking a method implies a desire for results. \n\nAuthority prevents true understanding of oneself. \n\nCreativeness arises only through self-knowledge. \n\nIn freedom, there is true creativeness.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To truly know oneself, one must cultivate an alert and free mind, unbound by beliefs or authority, as this understanding is the foundation of virtue and creativity."
