  "text": "The whole process of thinking is freedom.  \n\nWe function within the mind, the instrument of thought.  \n\nThought is always partial and often unreasonable.  \n\nTo free the mind from conditioning, see its totality without thought.  \n\nThis is not a riddle; experiment and observe.  \n\nCan you see or listen without reaction?  \n\nYou may think it's impossible to see without thought.  \n\nWhen you say that, you block yourself with thought.  \n\nCan the mind be aware of its conditioning?  \n\nBe aware of your identity without judgment.  \n\nAwareness of your totality allows conditioning to dissolve.  \n\nAll thinking is conditioned by our background and culture.  \n\nThere is no such thing as free thinking.  \n\nAwareness may help uncondition the mind without will.  \n\nDesire to uncondition creates conflict.  \n\nJust be aware; this awareness may resolve problems.  \n\nThe urge to be free creates new patterns of conditioning.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To achieve true freedom, one must become aware of their conditioning without the interference of thought."
