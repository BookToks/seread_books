  "text": "Belief has rituals and compulsions that bind and separate people.  \n\nWe start by inquiring into truth and the meaning of suffering.  \n\nSoon, we become caught in beliefs, rituals, and theories.  \n\nBelief corrupts because it empowers the self and the mind.  \n\nWe equate belief in God with religion.  \n\nTo disbelieve leads to being labeled an atheist by society.  \n\nDifferent societies condemn believers and non-believers alike.  \n\nReligion becomes about belief, which limits the mind's freedom.  \n\nTrue understanding comes from freedom, not belief.  \n\nBeliefs separate people, creating divisions like Hinduism and Christianity.  \n\nBelief does not resolve confusion; it merely masks it.  \n\nTo face confusion, we do not need belief.  \n\nBelief acts as a barrier between us and our problems.  \n\nThose who believe often escape their true nature.  \n\nMany who worship God may still act cruelly and dishonestly.  \n\nWe must question why we accept beliefs.  \n\nUnderstanding our motives may lead to freedom from them.  \n\nBeliefs create conflict and antagonism among people.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Belief acts as a screen that separates individuals and perpetuates confusion, preventing true understanding and freedom."
