  "text": "The mind consists of words and other elements. \n\nCan the mind be free of the word \"envy\"? \n\nWords like God, truth, hate, and envy affect the mind. \n\nIs the mind free of these words? \n\nIf not, it cannot face envy. \n\nWhen the mind looks directly at envy, it acts swiftly. \n\nThinking about non-envy distracts from facing envy. \n\nRecognition occurs through words, which give continuity to feelings. \n\nExtraordinary seeing comes without seeking or effort. \n\nThe mind must be sharp and awake, independent of experience. \n\nWords are not the actual things they describe. \n\nTouching an object reveals its actuality beyond words. \n\nThe word \"God\" can mesmerize and distract people. \n\nThe verbal state is built through centuries of social interaction. \n\nCan this verbal imprisonment be wiped away immediately? \n\nDoes it require time to break free from it? \n\nOr must it happen instantly?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The mind's attachment to words like \"envy\" distracts from facing the actual feelings and facts, hindering true understanding and perception."
