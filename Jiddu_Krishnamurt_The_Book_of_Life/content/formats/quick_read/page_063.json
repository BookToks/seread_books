  "text": "We cling to people, countries, beliefs, and ideas.  \n\nWhen these attachments are lost, we feel empty.  \n\nWe try to fill this emptiness by clinging to something else.  \n\nExamine your heart and mind closely.  \n\nI am a mirror for you to see yourself.  \n\nIf you want to look, do so clearly and intensely.  \n\nUnderstand your passion, which often leads to sorrow.  \n\nPassion with a cause becomes lust and leads to conflict.  \n\nYou strive for a state that is gone or to maintain one.  \n\nTrue passion is unrelated to a cause and not an effect.  \n\nTruth needs a healthy, innocent mind to appreciate it.  \n\nIt requires a rich mind, free from experience and time.  \n\nThe real God desires a complete human being.  \n\nThis being must be sensitive to beauty and suffering.  \n\nYou must feel intensely about everything around you.  \n\nIntelligence arises from sensitivity and observation.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Our attachments lead to emptiness and sorrow, and true understanding requires examining our passions without seeking to dissolve our miseries."
