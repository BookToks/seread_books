  "text": "We often ignore suffering. \n\nWe seek to escape it. \n\nThis escape dulls our minds and hearts. \n\nWe turn to gurus, saviors, or addictions. \n\nUnderstanding suffering is not about finding causes. \n\nAnyone can identify their own thoughtlessness or brutality. \n\nIf I observe suffering without seeking answers, I learn. \n\nMy mind becomes alert and sensitive. \n\nThis sensitivity helps me notice others' suffering. \n\nPsychological pain arises from clinging to satisfying things. \n\nFear of losing these things leads to more pain. \n\nAccumulated experiences prevent disturbance and pain. \n\nKnowledge helps prevent pain, both physical and psychological. \n\nBeliefs act as barriers against psychological pain. \n\nI may reject some beliefs based on my experience. \n\nUltimately, both beliefs and knowledge serve to ward off pain.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Understanding suffering requires facing it directly rather than seeking to escape from it through various distractions."
