  "text": "Causation is not compassion. It is a marketplace issue.  \n\nAnother problem is changing myself. How will it affect society?  \n\nMost people do not care about this discussion.  \n\nMany listen out of curiosity and then move on.  \n\nMachines are advancing quickly. Most people are pushed along.  \n\nThey cannot meet life with love and compassion.  \n\nIf I change, how will it affect our relationship?  \n\nSociety is our relationship with each other.  \n\nIf a few of us change, how will it impact the world?  \n\nCan an individual affect the collective unconscious?  \n\nHow can compassion be transmitted meaningfully?  \n\nUsing propaganda does not fill the heart.  \n\nCompulsion does not create true goodness or compassion.  \n\nWe must understand envy, greed, and ambition to find freedom.  \n\nOnly then can character and compassion truly flourish.  \n\nSociety itself is corrupt.  \n\nOnly those freeing themselves can embody goodness.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The transformation of an individual through understanding and compassion is essential for genuine goodness, as societal structures often corrupt true character."
