  "text": "Can I look at smoking without condemnation or justification? \n\nIt is difficult to observe without rejecting or accepting. \n\nOur tradition urges us to justify rather than be curious. \n\nThe mind often operates on problems instead of being watchful. \n\nIs constant renewal and rebirth essential? \n\nBurdened experiences from yesterday hinder renewal. \n\nRenewal transcends birth and death; it requires freedom from memory. \n\nUnderstanding occurs only in the present without comparison or judgment. \n\nIncomplete experiences leave marks that create continuity. \n\nThe present is not a means to an end; it is eternal. \n\nLive each experience fully and deeply to find renewal. \n\nWe must experience and understand each day without gathering burdens. \n\nWe desire fame because we do not love our work. \n\nIf we loved our craft, fame would not matter. \n\nOur education promotes success over genuine passion. \n\nThe result becomes more important than the action itself.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** True renewal and understanding come from fully experiencing the present without the burdens of past memories or the desire for fame."
