  "text": "I do not know if you have noticed the role of intellect.  \n\nThe media cultivates reason in our lives.  \n\nI am not against reason; it is important.  \n\nHowever, intellect analyzes our belonging and reality.  \n\nWe have learned to analyze ourselves.  \n\nIntellect can inquire and draw conclusions.  \n\nPure feeling is often interrupted by intellect.  \n\nThis interference creates a mediocre mind.  \n\nIntellect reasons based on conditioning and experience.  \n\nFeeling is corrupted by society and fear.  \n\nCan these two reveal the truth?  \n\nOr is there only perception without them?  \n\nLearning is not just accumulating knowledge.  \n\nAccumulating knowledge is a mechanical process.  \n\nA learning mind does not claim to know.  \n\nLearning is a continuous movement without an end.  \n\nIt is a vital process that does not accumulate.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The intellect's analysis can hinder pure feeling, leading to a mediocre mind that struggles to perceive truth."
