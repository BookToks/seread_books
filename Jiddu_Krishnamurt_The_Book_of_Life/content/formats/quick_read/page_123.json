  "text": "To discover something new, start on your own.  \n\nBegin a journey without knowledge.  \n\nKnowledge can lead to experiences, but they are not real.  \n\nIn our search for knowledge, we lose love and sensitivity.  \n\nWe become specialized and less integrated.  \n\nWisdom cannot be replaced by knowledge.  \n\nNo amount of facts will free us from suffering.  \n\nKnowledge is necessary, but too much suffocates the heart.  \n\nInformation is limited, while wisdom is infinite.  \n\nWe often mistake a part for the whole.  \n\nIntellect cannot lead to the whole; it is only a part.  \n\nWe have separated intellect from feeling, losing balance.  \n\nEducation sharpens the intellect but neglects feeling.  \n\nIntelligence integrates reason and love with self-knowledge.  \n\nThe intellect inquires and analyzes but can limit pure feeling.  \n\nA mind committed to conclusions ceases to think.  \n\nSuch a mind loses the ability to inquire.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Knowledge can lead to experiences that are ultimately false, while true wisdom requires a balance of intellect and feeling, fostering self-knowledge and understanding."
