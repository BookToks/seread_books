  "text": "Can the crude mind become sensitive?  \n\nIf I say my mind is crude, I cannot become sensitive.  \n\nThe effort to become sensitive is itself crudity.  \n\nRecognizing my crudeness without wanting to change is key.  \n\nI must observe my crudeness daily.  \n\nThis includes my greedy eating and rough treatment of others.  \n\nUnderstanding my stupidity is more important than becoming intelligent.  \n\nEfforts to appear intelligent only mask my stupidity.  \n\nI may quote books but remain essentially stupid.  \n\nAwareness of my stupidity can lead to transformation.  \n\nHierarchical structures hinder true brotherhood.  \n\nLove does not allow divisions or distinctions.  \n\nSeparation from God is created by my own mind.  \n\nNo ritual or guru can bridge this separation.  \n\nUnderstanding desire's conflict requires self-knowledge.  \n\nConstant awareness of the self is essential.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The crude mind cannot become sensitive through effort, but rather through understanding and observing its own nature."
