  "text": "Parents do not tell children stories about nature's beauty. \n\nThis creates a strange society. \n\nSome people are immensely rich, while others have nothing. \n\nHow did this society come to be? \n\nRevolution may break the pattern, but a new one forms. \n\nThis new society often resembles the old one. \n\nRevolutions in France, Russia, and China show this cycle. \n\nCan we create a society without corruption and misery? \n\nIt requires individuals to break away from the collective. \n\nWe must be free of ambition and understand love. \n\nCompassion cannot be cultivated through thought. \n\nIt is not the opposite of hate or violence. \n\nWithout compassion, we risk becoming brutal and mechanical. \n\nCompassion is an active present, not a static word. \n\nIt cannot be forced or cultivated through discipline. \n\nTrue compassion arises when thought ends at its root. \n\nChange must occur without compulsion or propaganda. \n\nCompassion must come from genuine understanding and awareness.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A society plagued by inequality and corruption can only transform when individuals free themselves from ambition and truly understand love and compassion."
