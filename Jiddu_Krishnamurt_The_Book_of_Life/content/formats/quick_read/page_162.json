  "text": "When we pray, we seek something outside ourselves. \n\nThis prayer reflects our own desires and confusion. \n\nWe pray when we feel sorrow and lack understanding. \n\nThe answer to prayer is often what we project. \n\nThis answer is usually satisfying; otherwise, we reject it. \n\nQuieting the mind through repetition is a habit. \n\nPrayer cannot reveal what is beyond our mind's projection. \n\nTrue stillness cannot be forced or induced. \n\nInduced stillness is not genuine; it hides inner turmoil. \n\nReligion is often a collection of beliefs and rituals. \n\nThese beliefs may lead to a false sense of security. \n\nMorality can be imitated but does not define religion. \n\nYou must discover the truth for yourself. \n\nBelief does not bring freedom; it binds the mind. \n\nTrue freedom comes from self-reliance and initiative.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Prayer and organized religion are seen as projections of the mind that do not lead to true understanding or reality."
