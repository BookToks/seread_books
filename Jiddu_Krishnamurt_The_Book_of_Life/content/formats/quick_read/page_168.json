  "text": "There must always be conflict in the mind. \n\nA mind in conflict cannot understand meditation's depth. \n\nIn meditation, there can be no thinker. \n\nThought must end, especially thoughts driven by desire. \n\nMeditation is not about achieving results. \n\nIt is not about breathing or performing tricks. \n\nMeditation is part of life itself. \n\nBeing aware while driving or walking is meditation. \n\nNot being anything is the start of freedom. \n\nAwareness reveals that you are not free. \n\nThe mind must investigate its attachments. \n\nThis investigation requires hard work and alertness. \n\nEverything can impede your freedom. \n\nYou created these impediments for security. \n\nLife is not static; it is always changing. \n\nTo understand this is to engage in meditation. \n\nAwareness of thoughts reveals the mind's process. \n\nWrite down your thoughts and feelings to become aware.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Meditation requires the cessation of thought and the recognition of one's attachments to achieve true freedom and self-awareness."
