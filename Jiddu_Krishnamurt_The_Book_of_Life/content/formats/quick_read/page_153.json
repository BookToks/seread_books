  "text": "The mind reacts based on memory and past experiences. \n\nCan the mind be free from its conditioning? \n\nLove is not the same as pleasure. \n\nUnderstanding pleasure helps in understanding love. \n\nFor many, sex is a problem. \n\nPeople often run away from this problem. \n\nThe sannyasi takes a vow of celibacy to escape. \n\nDenying a natural part of oneself leads to inner conflict. \n\nWe tend to suppress or escape problems. \n\nSuppressing is similar to running away. \n\nThe sannyasi may appear simple but struggles internally. \n\nLove cannot be cultivated or divided into types. \n\nLove arises naturally as compassion when problems are understood. \n\nAmbition and attachment hinder love. \n\nLove requires freedom and a quiet mind. \n\nWithout love, life feels empty and problematic. \n\nA religious mind experiences love and truth.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Love cannot be cultivated or reduced to pleasure, and it arises naturally from a mind free of conditioning and self-centeredness."
