  "text": "Part of me is in agony for various reasons.  \n\nAnother part wants to be free from sorrow.  \n\nWe are all these conflicting parts.  \n\nOne part rejects sorrow while another seeks explanations.  \n\nAnother part escapes from the fact of sorrow.  \n\nHow can I understand sorrow totally like this?  \n\nIntegrated understanding allows freedom from sorrow.  \n\nIf I am torn in different directions, I see no truth.  \n\nWhen there is no observer, suffering becomes you.  \n\nYou are not apart from the pain; you are the pain.  \n\nWithout labeling, you simply exist as that pain.  \n\nIf you are that pain, there is nothing to be done.  \n\nA fundamental transformation occurs when you accept it.  \n\nThen \"I suffer\" no longer exists without a center.  \n\nSuffering has many varieties and complications.  \n\nWe carry this burden from birth to death.  \n\nIf we accept suffering as inevitable, we stop inquiring.  \n\nEscaping suffering closes the door to understanding.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Understanding suffering requires an integrated approach that transcends division and escape, recognizing that one is not separate from their pain."
