  "text": "That is too much to ask. \n\nOne cannot live like that in this chaotic world. \n\nPeople must go to the office daily and earn a livelihood. \n\nThey bear children and endure the nagging of partners. \n\nWhat is being said relates directly to everyday life. \n\nOut of this aloneness comes a pure and gentle virtue. \n\nMaking mistakes is of little importance. \n\nWhat matters is feeling completely alone and uncontaminated. \n\nOnly such a mind can know what is beyond words. \n\nLoneliness is a factor of sorrow for humanity. \n\nCompanions and knowledge do not eliminate this loneliness. \n\nOne must see loneliness without comparison or escape. \n\nWe are not alone; we are influenced by many factors. \n\nBeing totally alone brings a sense of being an outsider. \n\nOnly the completely alone are innocent and free from sorrow. \n\nCreating a new world requires an anonymous and alone mind. \n\nThis implies a revolt against conformity and respectability.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** True aloneness, free from external influences and attachments, is essential for experiencing purity, innocence, and the potential to create a new society."
