  "text": "Can the mind be free from authority and fear? \n\nIf so, it ends imitation, which is mechanical. \n\nVirtue is not repeating what is good. \n\nWhen it becomes mechanical, it loses its virtue. \n\nVirtue must arise moment to moment, like humility. \n\nA mind without humility cannot learn. \n\nSocial morality is not true morality; it is immoral. \n\nIt encourages competition, greed, and ambition. \n\nVirtue transcends morality and creates order. \n\nOrder is not based on patterns or formulas. \n\nFollowing a formula creates problems of immorality. \n\nExternal authority can be destructive to understanding virtue. \n\nWe follow our own authority from experience and knowledge. \n\nPsychological authority harms virtue because it is living. \n\nYou cannot cultivate humility or love, nor virtue. \n\nWithout virtue, there is no foundation for clear thinking.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The mind must be free from authority and fear to understand true virtue, which cannot be mechanically cultivated or imitated."
