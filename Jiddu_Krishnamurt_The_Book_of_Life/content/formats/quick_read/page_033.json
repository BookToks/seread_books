  "text": "Ideas can limit action.  \n\nThey may mold thought and restrict what we do.  \n\nAction shaped by an idea cannot liberate us.  \n\nUnderstanding this is crucial.  \n\nIf an idea shapes action, it cannot solve our problems.  \n\nWe must first understand how the idea forms.  \n\nThe world faces potential catastrophe.  \n\nMany seek shelter in ideas.  \n\nWe believe ideologies can solve crises.  \n\nIdeologies hinder direct relationships and prevent action.  \n\nWe desire peace as an idea, not as reality.  \n\nPeace exists only when confusion ceases.  \n\nWe cling to ideas instead of seeking true peace.  \n\nThis search leads to conditioned answers from the past.  \n\nKnowledge and experience create conflict with present facts.  \n\nThis conflict perpetuates existing problems.  \n\nAction must come from a different approach.  \n\nWe must explore acting without ideation.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Action compelled by ideas limits true liberation and understanding, while genuine action arises from love, free from ideation."
