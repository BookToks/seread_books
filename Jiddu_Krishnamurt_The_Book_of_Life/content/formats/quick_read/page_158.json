  "text": "Aloneness is not isolation or uniqueness. \n\nTo be unique means to be exceptional in some way. \n\nComplete aloneness requires sensitivity, intelligence, and understanding. \n\nIt means the mind is free from all influences. \n\nOnly in this state can one understand religion and immortality. \n\nLoneliness is different from aloneness. \n\nOne must pass through loneliness to achieve aloneness. \n\nA lonely person cannot know true aloneness. \n\nThe mind is separative and knows loneliness. \n\nAloneness is not influenced by others. \n\nThe mind cannot be alone; it is made of many parts. \n\nAwareness of loneliness can lead to aloneness. \n\nMost people seek dependence and companionship. \n\nConflict arises from a state of separation. \n\nTrue aloneness is free from conflict. \n\nBeing alone means being free from the past. \n\nIn such aloneness, there is innocence.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Aloneness, distinct from loneliness, is a state of mind free from societal influences and past conditioning, allowing for true understanding and innocence."
