  "text": "No belief can set you free.  \n\nThe truth is the only liberating factor.  \n\nYou must see it for yourself.  \n\nYou must take the voyage on an uncharted sea.  \n\nNature has splendour and beauty.  \n\nChildren laugh, but sorrow exists.  \n\nThere is sorrow in many forms.  \n\nSorrow exists in death and unfulfilled expectations.  \n\nWe often seek solutions to escape sorrow.  \n\nWe avoid facing it through myths and beliefs.  \n\nSorrow ends with perception of what is.  \n\nMost meet sorrow superficially.  \n\nEducation and influences make us superficial.  \n\nWe build walls to avoid suffering.  \n\nThese defenses prevent deeper inquiry.  \n\nObserve how you cope with your sorrows.  \n\nGenerations pass on these patterns.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sorrow is an inherent part of life that often goes unexamined, as people seek superficial escapes rather than confronting it directly."
