  "text": "Becoming powerful or successful is not chastity. \n\nIt is the result of resisting desire. \n\nChastity is not a problem where there is love. \n\nLife becomes complete when lived in love. \n\nThis revolution can create a new world. \n\nTotal abandonment requires deep passion. \n\nYou cannot abandon everything intellectually or emotionally. \n\nOnly intense passion allows for total abandonment. \n\nA man without passion cannot appreciate beauty. \n\nA mind that clings to power cannot abandon itself. \n\nMost people have little true passion. \n\nLust and longing create intensity but are not true passion. \n\nUnderstanding sorrow requires the passion of complete attention. \n\nPure passion must exist to end sorrow. \n\nWithout passion, there is no true beauty. \n\nBeauty beyond feeling cannot be realized without passion. \n\nPassion is not an emotion or a commodity. \n\nIt is a flame that destroys falsehoods.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Chastity becomes irrelevant in the presence of love, which allows for total abandonment and the awakening of pure passion necessary to understand beauty and end sorrow."
