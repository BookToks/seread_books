  "text": "There is only craving.  \n\nThere is no separate entity from craving.  \n\nCraving wears different masks based on interests.  \n\nThese interests create conflict and establish the chooser.  \n\nThe chooser is disorder, not a means to be free of fear.  \n\nThere is no gradual process to rid oneself of fear.  \n\nTime creates disorder and division among people.  \n\nI observe my anger as “I am angry.”  \n\nAt the moment of anger, there is no “I.”  \n\nThe “I” arises with time and thought.  \n\nI can look without the observer or judgment.  \n\nSeeing without thought allows the mind to be free.  \n\nI can examine fear as part of a larger whole.  \n\nUnderstanding the cause of fear leads to its cessation.  \n\nDependence on anything breeds fear and ignorance.  \n\nFear is both inborn and acquired from the past.  \n\nThe past must be understood through the present.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Understanding the root causes of fear through self-awareness leads to its cessation, rather than seeking courage or methods to eliminate it."
