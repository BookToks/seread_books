  "text": "To end sorrow, contact death while living. \n\nDie to your name, house, and property. \n\nThis allows you to see things clearly. \n\nWe face limited physical death. \n\nThe organism will end, and we know this. \n\nWe invent a life filled with agony and problems. \n\nWe call this life the \"soul,\" but it is thought. \n\nOne must live daily, dying to connect with life. \n\nIn ending, there is renewal and rebirth. \n\nThis is not comfort to believe or examine. \n\nWhat continues has no rebirth or renewal. \n\nIn dying, there is immortality and eternity. \n\nWhen fear ends, you open to the unknown. \n\nReality and death are both unknowns. \n\nSeeing death as an ending allows renewal. \n\nReincarnation is egotistic and leads to illusion. \n\nFulfillment comes only in the present moment. \n\nYou must liberate yourself from self-protection.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To end sorrow and experience renewal, one must die to their attachments and preconceived notions, embracing the unknown and the reality of life and death."
