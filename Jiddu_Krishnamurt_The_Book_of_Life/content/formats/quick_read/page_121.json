  "text": "Thought brings frustration and contradiction.  \n\nAll thought is partial; it can never be total.  \n\nThought responds to memory, which is always partial.  \n\nMemory results from experience, conditioning the mind.  \n\nAll thinking and knowledge are inevitably partial.  \n\nThought cannot solve our many problems.  \n\nReasoning is conditioned by circumstances and culture.  \n\nIt is influenced by food, climate, media, and daily life.  \n\nThinking is a mechanistic response of memory.  \n\nKnowledge is incomplete; thus, thinking is limited.  \n\nThere is no freedom of thought.  \n\nWe can discover a freedom beyond thought.  \n\nThis freedom comes from awareness of conflicts and influences.  \n\nAction precedes the idea of the actor.  \n\nThe thinker is not separate from thoughts.  \n\nImmediate perception reveals truth or falsehood.  \n\nIntellect and reasoning do not define perception.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** All thought is partial and conditioned by experience, limiting true freedom and understanding."
