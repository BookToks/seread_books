  "text": "There is a difference between the word and the thing. \n\nThe word \"door\" is not the door. \n\nTo meditate is to purge the mind of self-centered activity. \n\nIn meditation, you find silence and total emptiness. \n\nThe mind becomes uncontaminated by society and desire. \n\nIt is completely alone and innocent. \n\nThis allows the timeless and eternal to emerge. \n\nThis whole process is meditation. \n\nGenerosity of the heart begins meditation. \n\nGoodness is the flowering of meditation. \n\nYou cannot meditate if you are ambitious or bound by authority. \n\nA generous mind gives without thought or motive. \n\nMeditation requires freedom from pride and success. \n\nGoodness can only grow in fertile ground. \n\nMeditation is essential to life. \n\nIt helps us understand influence and truth. \n\nMeditation is as essential as beauty.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Meditation is the process of purging the mind of self-centered activity to achieve a state of silence and innocence, allowing for the timeless and eternal to emerge."
