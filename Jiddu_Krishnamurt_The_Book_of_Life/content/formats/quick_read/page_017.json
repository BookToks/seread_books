  "text": "Does belief give enthusiasm? \n\nCan enthusiasm exist without belief? \n\nIs enthusiasm necessary, or is different energy needed? \n\nMost of us have enthusiasm for various activities. \n\nThis enthusiasm fades without constant nourishment. \n\nWe then seek new enthusiasms for other things. \n\nIs there energy that doesn’t depend on belief? \n\nDo we need any belief, and why? \n\nWe don’t need beliefs about sunshine or quarrels. \n\nLife’s misery and conflict are facts, not beliefs. \n\nBelief often serves as an escape from reality. \n\nReligion should not be an escape from facts. \n\nIt should involve understanding our everyday relationships. \n\nConfusion arises without understanding these relationships. \n\nA mind agitated by belief cannot know truth. \n\nOnly a mind understanding love can grasp reality.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Belief serves as an escape from reality, hindering true understanding and relationships, while genuine religion arises from comprehending one's actual circumstances."
