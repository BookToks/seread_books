  "text": "Change driven by force or fear is not real change.  \n\nInfluence or propaganda does not lead to true transformation.  \n\nIntellectually, one may agree, but understanding change without motive is rare.  \n\nYou may change your ideas, but thought remains conditioned.  \n\nOpposing thoughts create conflict, leading to modified continuity.  \n\nThis change is still within the realm of thought.  \n\nOne idea simply replaces another.  \n\nTo change outside thought is challenging.  \n\nAll consciousness exists within thought's boundaries.  \n\nReal change occurs only beyond these confines.  \n\nThe mind must recognize its limitations to achieve this.  \n\nThis understanding is essential for true meditation.  \n\nChange must come from the known to the unknown.  \n\nAuthority exists in the known, creating a hierarchical system.  \n\nPeople often seek certainty and success from others.  \n\nThis motive drives many to pursue change.  \n\nReal change involves risk and potential failure, not guarantees.  \n\nTrue revolution emerges when one steps into the unknown.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Real change occurs only when moving from the known to the unknown, free from authority and motives."
