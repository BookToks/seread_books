  "text": "Parents do not truly understand sorrow. \n\nThey only have an idea of it. \n\nThey see a symbol, but never meet sorrow. \n\nMost people experience sorrow in various forms. \n\nIt appears in relationships, death, and unfulfilled lives. \n\nSorrow also exists in physical ailments and disabilities. \n\nDeath is always waiting, yet we do not confront sorrow. \n\nWe either worship it, rationalize it, or run away. \n\nIn churches, sorrow is made holy and extraordinary. \n\nIn the East, people also evade sorrow in unique ways. \n\nFew are truly free from sorrow, in any culture. \n\nIf we listen without emotion, we can understand sorrow. \n\nThis understanding could free us from anxiety and fear. \n\nThen, we might know what love truly is. \n\nWe must follow the movement of suffering closely. \n\nSuffering is part of us, not something outside. \n\nBy staying with it, we can discover our true state.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sorrow is a pervasive experience that many avoid or rationalize, yet true understanding and acceptance of it can lead to freedom from self-deception and clearer perception of love."
