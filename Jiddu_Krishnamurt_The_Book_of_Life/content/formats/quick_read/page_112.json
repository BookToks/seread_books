  "text": "As long as there is an observer, there is no contact with what is.  \n\nThe observer seeks experience and evaluates.  \n\nWhen you feel physical pain, there is only pain.  \n\nThere is immediate action when there is pain.  \n\nThe pain is you; there is no observer.  \n\nIf you do not understand this, life becomes conflict.  \n\nThe observer is the observed; grasp this deeply.  \n\nBe aware when you look at a flower or cloud.  \n\nInstead of asking about God, focus on what is.  \n\nUnderstanding what is leads to extraordinary silence.  \n\nReality is in what is, not in the distance.  \n\nThe answer to a problem is in the problem.  \n\nI am in sorrow and have ideas about it.  \n\nThese ideas prevent me from facing the fact.  \n\nThe mind escapes from action with formulas.  \n\nWe are violent people, despite talking of nonviolence.  \n\nThe fact is I am angry; that is what matters.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The observer's separation from the observed creates conflict, preventing immediate contact with reality and action in response to what is."
