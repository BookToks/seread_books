  "text": "No part of the mind is unconditioned.  \n\nYour mind is conditioned throughout.  \n\nThere is no unconditioned part of you.  \n\nThis is a fact, whether you like it or not.  \n\nYou may think of a part as unconditioned, but it is not.  \n\nThis part exists within the field of thought.  \n\nYour mind is conditioned, both conscious and unconscious.  \n\nAny effort to free itself is also conditioned.  \n\nWhen you say, “I know I am conditioned,” do you truly know?  \n\nDoes this knowledge have the same impact as seeing a cobra?  \n\nRealizing you are conditioned brings immediate action.  \n\nThe difficulty lies in understanding all its implications.  \n\nThe unconscious carries the weight of the past.  \n\nAnalysis cannot fully cleanse the unconscious.  \n\nThere is always an analyzer and the analyzed in analysis.  \n\nThis duality creates conflict and does not lead to freedom.  \n\nI reject the analytical process completely.  \n\nUnderstanding this frees me from analysis.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Your mind is entirely conditioned, and any effort to uncondition it is also influenced by that conditioning."
