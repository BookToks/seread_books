  "text": "Truth is a fact. \n\nYou can understand it only by removing barriers. \n\nThese barriers include your relationships with property, people, and nature. \n\nIf you do not understand relationships, seeking God causes confusion. \n\nDominating or being dominated prevents love and truth. \n\nAmbition, suppression, and substitution also block truth. \n\nOnly those who are not seeking can know truth. \n\nTruth is not continuous and has no fixed place. \n\nIt is always new and seen moment to moment. \n\nWhat was true yesterday may not be true today. \n\nThe mind wants to make truth continuous, but it cannot. \n\nTruth cannot be sought; it is found in living. \n\nAccumulated knowledge withers away and is not truth. \n\nTruth exists in every thought, relationship, and gesture. \n\nLiving truthfully makes us creative, not perfect.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Truth can only be understood by removing the barriers between the mind and reality, and it is discovered moment to moment rather than through seeking or accumulation."
