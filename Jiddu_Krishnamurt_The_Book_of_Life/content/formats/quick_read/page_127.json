  "text": "We often pursue death instead of living. \n\nLiving is the greatest revolution. \n\nLiving has no pattern, but death does. \n\nYou chase Utopia, inviting death, not life. \n\nTruth is found moment by moment. \n\nThe mind is a product of time. \n\nIt cannot find what is true. \n\nTo know the mind, it must know itself. \n\nQualities are not separate from the mind. \n\nObserve how your mind functions. \n\nUnderstanding leads to something new. \n\nThis newness brings passion and enthusiasm. \n\nInward revolution transforms the world. \n\nThere is only one state: consciousness. \n\nConsciousness is always of the past. \n\nThe present is a passage to the future. \n\nThe mind is occupied with the past or future.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Living authentically requires an inward revolution that transcends the conditioned mind's fixation on the past and future."
