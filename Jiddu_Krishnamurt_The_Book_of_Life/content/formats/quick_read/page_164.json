  "text": "What is happening in the world?  \n\nYou have many Gods dividing you.  \n\nChristian, Hindu, and Muslim beliefs create separation.  \n\nThese truths exploit people in the hands of a few.  \n\nYou taste each belief, losing your discrimination.  \n\nYou suffer and seek remedies from any sect.  \n\nYour beliefs in God are dividing you.  \n\nYou talk of brotherhood, yet deny unity.  \n\nYou cling to beliefs that intensify limitations.  \n\nTrue religion is not rituals or idols.  \n\nIt is the feeling of goodness and love.  \n\nThis feeling brings an end to your search.  \n\nYou must leave your self-made pool.  \n\nThen life will take care of you.  \n\nThe search for God must seek truth in everything.  \n\nIf it is merely an escape, it is not God.  \n\nThe God of temples and books is not real.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Beliefs in different gods and organized religions are causing division among people rather than fostering unity."
