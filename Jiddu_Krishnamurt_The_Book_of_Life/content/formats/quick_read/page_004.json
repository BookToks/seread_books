  "text": "Do not carry the burden of old knowledge.  \n\nKnowledge of another does not lead to truth.  \n\nYou use knowledge for self-protection and security.  \n\nThis prevents you from being a truth-seeker.  \n\nThere is no path to discovering truth.  \n\nYour mind must be quiet to find something new.  \n\nCrowded thoughts act as obstacles to new ideas.  \n\nKnowledge and learning can impede true understanding.  \n\nLearning has two meanings: accumulation and psychological.  \n\nPsychological learning comes from experience and tradition.  \n\nThis learning overlaps with outward skills.  \n\nWe often question if the mind learns psychologically.  \n\nIt translates life based on what it has learned.  \n\nTrue learning implies discovering something new.  \n\nLearning is not merely adding to what you know.  \n\nIt requires clear thinking without coercion.  \n\nCoercion can come from influence or reward.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** True learning requires a quiet mind free from the burden of accumulated knowledge and coercion, allowing for genuine understanding and discovery."
