  "text": "Thought is limited by the thinker. \n\nThe thinker is always conditioned and never free. \n\nWhen thought occurs, idea follows. \n\nIdeas create more confusion when we act. \n\nIs it possible to act without idea? \n\nYes, it is through love. \n\nLove is not an idea or sensation. \n\nWe can be aware of love by understanding ideas. \n\nNo political or religious way will solve our problems. \n\nWhen you love, is there idea? \n\nExamine this deeply. \n\nEvery other way has failed to answer misery. \n\nWe must abandon ideas to know love. \n\nGood and evil exist, but why do we divide life? \n\nComplete attention means no good or evil exists. \n\nGoodness is a state of love. \n\nWhen love is present, there is no good or bad. \n\nCessation of attention leads to conflict between what is and should be.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Action can only be truly liberated through love, which transcends the limitations of ideas and conditioned thought."
