  "text": "The individual is essential for social or religious organizations.  \n\nHis ignorance, greed, and fear maintain ignorance, greed, and hate.  \n\nIf the individual changes, he can affect the world.  \n\nThe world reflects your thoughts, ignorance, and hate.  \n\nWhen you are thoughtful and aware, you dissociate from pain.  \n\nUnderstanding brings completeness and wholeness.  \n\nYou become what you fight against.  \n\nAnger breeds more anger in response.  \n\nFighting evil with evil makes you evil too.  \n\nThere is a better way than meeting hate with hate.  \n\nViolent methods do not lead to understanding or peace.  \n\nAnger must be studied and understood, not overcome violently.  \n\nWe create enemies through our thoughts and actions.  \n\nUnderstanding the cause of enmity is crucial.  \n\nRight thinking ends division and transcends enmity.  \n\nLove goes beyond friend and enemy.  \n\nWe seek happiness and peace in a troubled world.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The individualâ€™s ignorance, greed, and fear perpetuate societal violence, and true change requires self-awareness and understanding rather than fighting hate with hate."
