  "text": "There can be goodness with total attention and no effort.  \n\nMust we know drunkenness to understand sobriety?  \n\nMust you experience hate to know compassion?  \n\nMust you go through wars to understand peace?  \n\nThis thinking is false.  \n\nWe assume there is evolution from bad to good.  \n\nThere is physical growth, like a plant becoming a tree.  \n\nBut is there psychological progress?  \n\nCan the “me” evolve from evil to good?  \n\nThe psychological “me” will always remain evil.  \n\nWe hope the “I” will become perfect through time.  \n\nThe “I” is a name, a form, a bundle of memories.  \n\nWe want this “me” to continue and become perfect.  \n\nWe think of a timeless “supreme” self, but it is still within time.  \n\nCan the mind be free from the past?  \n\nIt can only be free if not occupied with past thoughts.  \n\nIf occupied, the mind is not free.  \n\nThe past is always present in our consciousness.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Goodness arises from total attention without the effort to define oneself as good or bad."
