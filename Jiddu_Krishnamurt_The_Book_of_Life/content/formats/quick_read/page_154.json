  "text": "What is love without motive?  \n\nCan there be love without wanting something in return?  \n\nCan love exist without feeling wounded when it is unreciprocated?  \n\nIf I offer friendship and you turn away, I feel hurt.  \n\nThat hurt comes from friendship, generosity, and sympathy.  \n\nAs long as I feel hurt or fear, there is no love.  \n\nUnderstanding this leads to the answer.  \n\nHow can man live without love?  \n\nExistence without love brings control, confusion, and pain.  \n\nWe organize for existence and accept conflict as inevitable.  \n\nWithout love, organization becomes a mechanical nightmare.  \n\nModern society values efficiency, leading to more conflict.  \n\nThis creates confusion and powerful bureaucracies.  \n\nWe live in our minds, not in our hearts.  \n\nLove is dangerous and uncertain.  \n\nWe avoid uncertainty and danger, preferring efficiency.  \n\nOnly love can bring order and peace.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Love is fundamentally different from pleasure and cannot exist with motives or expectations."
