  "text": "We give lovely names to ideals and beliefs. \n\nSeeing the false allows my mind to perceive the true. \n\nA confused mind cannot find the truth. \n\nI must understand what is false in my relationships. \n\nPerceiving truth requires understanding falsehood. \n\nWithout removing ignorance, there is no enlightenment. \n\nSeeking enlightenment with an unenlightened mind is meaningless. \n\nI must see the false in my relationships with ideas and people. \n\nWhen the mind sees the false, the true emerges. \n\nThis brings ecstasy and happiness. \n\nBelief does not always give enthusiasm. \n\nEnthusiasm fades without nourishment. \n\nIs there energy that does not depend on belief? \n\nWe donâ€™t need beliefs for obvious facts. \n\nWe demand belief to escape reality. \n\nReligion should not be an escape from actuality. \n\nUnderstanding relationships is the essence of religion.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Understanding the false in our relationships and beliefs is essential for perceiving the truth and achieving enlightenment."
