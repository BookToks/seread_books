  "text": "We never say, “What suffers?” \n\nYou cannot see by enforcement or discipline. \n\nYou must look with interest and spontaneous comprehension. \n\nThen suffering and pain will vanish. \n\nAs long as I see suffering as outside me, it exists. \n\nWhen I treat suffering as external, I create a fictitious relationship. \n\nIf I see I am that suffering, everything transforms. \n\nThen there is full, integrated attention. \n\nWhat is regarded is understood and dissolved. \n\nThis means there is no fear, and sorrow does not exist. \n\nWhen you lose someone to death, you feel paralysis. \n\nAfter shock, sorrow emerges from loss. \n\nYou feel empty, lonely, and without support. \n\nYou must live with that emptiness. \n\nDo not rationalize or escape from it. \n\nJust live with it.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sorrow arises from our relationship with suffering, which transforms when we fully observe and accept it without attachment."
