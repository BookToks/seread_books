  "text": "You hurt me, and I store that hurt.  \n\nThis becomes my tradition.  \n\nI react to you from that tradition.  \n\nThis is the everyday process of our minds.  \n\nIs it possible to avoid this accumulative process?  \n\nThe two processes are different.  \n\nIf you say harsh words, it hurts me.  \n\nIf I do not give that hurt importance, I can meet you afresh.  \n\nThat is real education.  \n\nIt allows the mind to remain unconditioned.  \n\nWe have tried to subdue anger, but it does not dissolve.  \n\nAnger may arise from physical or psychological causes.  \n\nIt can stem from feeling thwarted or insecure.  \n\nTo dissolve anger, question your beliefs and opinions.  \n\nUnderstanding its causes can lead to cessation of anger.  \n\nCompassion and anger cannot coexist.  \n\nRighteousness cannot exist where there is anger.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The accumulation of hurt influences our reactions, but true education allows us to meet others afresh without being conditioned by past experiences."
