  "text": "The mind can free itself from conditioning. \n\nThen it can discover what lies beyond thought. \n\nThe mind is limited, consciously or unconsciously. \n\nFreedom is entirely different from conditioning. \n\nLife is a process of becoming. \n\nI want to become rich or beautiful. \n\nThis process involves strife and pain. \n\nThe mind projects desires and struggles to fulfill them. \n\nThe ideal is a self-projection, not the opposite. \n\nConflict arises from pursuing these projections. \n\nAwareness reveals the trick the mind plays. \n\nStruggle towards illusion leads to disintegration. \n\nWithout ideals and comparisons, transformation occurs. \n\nNaming creates a relationship with what is. \n\nWithout naming, what is ceases to exist. \n\nIntegration happens in this transformation.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The mind's struggle to become something different is a source of conflict and disintegration, and true transformation occurs when it is free from all ideals and projections."
