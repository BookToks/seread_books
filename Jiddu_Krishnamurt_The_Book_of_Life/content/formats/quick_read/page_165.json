  "text": "It is a marvelous escape. \n\nFinding truth requires examining all actions and relationships. \n\nWe must evaluate food, clothing, and shelter correctly. \n\nOur minds can achieve clarity and understanding. \n\nIf we seek reality, we will find it. \n\nConfusion about worldly matters prevents us from finding reality. \n\nA confused mind cannot know truth or God. \n\nIt must first decondition itself to understand. \n\nReality is the unknown; known things are not real. \n\nA believer in God cannot find God. \n\nOpenness to reality requires no belief. \n\nBelief is self-protection and limits understanding. \n\nThe mind, shaped by the past, cannot access the unknown. \n\nIt only projects images that are not real. \n\nReality emerges when the mind understands itself. \n\nOnly a silent mind can receive the unknown. \n\nUnderstanding relationships is essential for freedom. \n\nThe eternal arises when the mind is still.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To find reality, the mind must first decondition itself from beliefs and limitations, achieving a state of openness and silence."
