  "text": "If you are a Christian, your visions follow a certain pattern.  \n\nIf you are a Hindu, Buddhist, or Muslim, they follow a different pattern.  \n\nYou see Christ or Krishna based on your conditioning.  \n\nYour education and culture shape your visions.  \n\nThe actuality is the mind shaped in a certain mold.  \n\nThe vision is a projection of your tradition.  \n\nThis conditioning is the reality, not the vision.  \n\nUnderstanding this fact is simple but complicated by our judgments.  \n\nTo be free of evaluations is to understand what is.  \n\nA mind that gives opinions about facts is limited.  \n\nTranslations of facts prevent us from seeing the actual fact.  \n\nDiscussing opinions about facts does not change them.  \n\nThe fact exists alone; nothing else matters.  \n\nEverything is impermanent and in constant flux.  \n\nThe mind craves a permanent state of peace and love.  \n\nThis desire creates visions of a permanent paradise.  \n\nBut this permanency is born of impermanency.  \n\nThere is only one fact: impermanence.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Our perceptions and visions are shaped by our cultural conditioning, which obscures the actual facts of impermanence."
