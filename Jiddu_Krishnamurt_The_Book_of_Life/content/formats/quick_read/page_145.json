  "text": "It is good to be anonymous. \n\nHiding your brilliance has its beauty. \n\nBeing kind without recognition is valuable. \n\nThis does not bring fame or attention. \n\nYou can be a creative person without accolades. \n\nCreativeness cannot be reconciled with technical skill. \n\nYou can play the piano perfectly but lack creativity. \n\nTechnique does not make you a true artist. \n\nCreation must come before technique. \n\nWe often know techniques but feel empty inside. \n\nWe operate like machines without love for life. \n\nCreativeness arises from having something to express. \n\nThe joy of creation is essential for true artistry. \n\nUnderstanding your mind leads to genuine cooperation. \n\nInward revolution allows you to know when to cooperate. \n\nThis understanding can create a better world. \n\nIt leads to freedom from envy and comparison.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** True creativity arises from an inward revolution of understanding rather than mere technical skill."
