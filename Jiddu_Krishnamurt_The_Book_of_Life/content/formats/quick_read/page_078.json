  "text": "Energy creates its own discipline.  \n\nSeeking reality requires immense energy.  \n\nWasting energy occurs in the division between fact and idea.  \n\nCreating a pattern to save energy leads to contradiction.  \n\nPerceiving energy waste reveals that conflict is the principal cause.  \n\nConflict arises from unresolved problems and living in the past.  \n\nUnderstanding energy dissipation comes from observing daily conflicts.  \n\nConflict persists when ideas overshadow facts.  \n\nContradiction creates conflict and waste of energy.  \n\nEffort to overcome conflict generates resistance and energy.  \n\nResistance is destructive rather than creative.  \n\nMany people experience contradiction in their lives.  \n\nTension from contradiction can fuel creative expression.  \n\nHowever, this output results from conflict, not true creation.  \n\nFacing conflict reveals a different quality of energy.  \n\nWe must seek energy beyond thought and self-contradiction.  \n\nDestructive actions stem from compulsive energy and frustration.  \n\nWe need to explore energy outside these limitations.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The principal waste of energy in life arises from conflict and contradiction, which stems from prioritizing ideas over facts."
