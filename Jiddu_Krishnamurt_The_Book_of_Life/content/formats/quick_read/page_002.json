  "text": "I do not know if you have listened to a bird.  \n\nTo listen requires a quiet mind.  \n\nThis quietness is not mystical; it is simple.  \n\nYou must be quiet to hear what I say.  \n\nIf your mind is busy, you cannot listen.  \n\nWhen you look at a flower, do not name it.  \n\nDo not classify it or say what species it is.  \n\nThese actions stop you from truly seeing it.  \n\nListening is difficult with anyone, including loved ones.  \n\nYou must listen without thoughts to be in contact.  \n\nThis contact helps you discern truth from falsehood.  \n\nListening is a complete act that brings freedom.  \n\nEffort can distract you from true listening.  \n\nBe aware of your conflicts without forcing thoughts.  \n\nYour mind should be still to hear its struggles.  \n\nDo not try to become something or capture experiences.  \n\nListen simply to everything around you.  \n\nThen, you will find greater silence within.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Listening requires a quiet mind free from distractions to truly understand and connect with what is being heard."
