  "text": "The mind must not know its direction of change. \n\nKnowing the future state of the mind stops true change. \n\nSatisfaction from knowledge hinders change. \n\nA center seeking reward prevents real transformation. \n\nMost people focus on reward, punishment, and success. \n\nChange driven by desire is not genuine change. \n\nA mind desiring deep change must be free from the known. \n\nSuch a mind becomes still and can transform radically. \n\nComplete mutation in consciousness requires denying analysis. \n\nThe mind must reject falsehood without knowing the truth. \n\nKnowing truth means merely swapping falsehood for imagined truth. \n\nRenunciation occurs when you let go without expectation. \n\nNegation empties consciousness of the known. \n\nConsciousness is built on past experiences and knowledge. \n\nTo revolutionize consciousness, complete emptiness is necessary. \n\nEmptiness arises from recognizing what is false. \n\nThis emptiness leads to a profound change in consciousness.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** True change requires complete emptiness and freedom from the known, as any change motivated by desire for satisfaction is not genuine transformation."
