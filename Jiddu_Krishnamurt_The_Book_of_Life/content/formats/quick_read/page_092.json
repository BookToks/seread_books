  "text": "We seek happiness in impermanent things. \n\nSorrow becomes our constant companion. \n\nOvercoming sorrow is our problem. \n\nTo find true happiness, explore self-knowledge. \n\nSelf-knowledge is not an end in itself. \n\nHappiness is not found at the source. \n\nIt is found where you are on the river. \n\nAt the center is \"the me\" that seeks happiness. \n\nThis \"me\" struggles and never wants an end. \n\nOnly when \"the me\" ends can bliss begin. \n\nThis bliss cannot be sought after. \n\nHappiness beyond \"the me\" is incorruptible. \n\nOur minds seek permanent happiness, which is corrupt. \n\nCreative happiness arises without judgment. \n\nIt is not personal; it is like sunshine. \n\nHappiness sought from suffering is merely a reaction. \n\nWe must understand suffering to find true happiness.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** True happiness is found beyond the self and the pursuit of personal desires, emerging from a deeper understanding of life and suffering."
