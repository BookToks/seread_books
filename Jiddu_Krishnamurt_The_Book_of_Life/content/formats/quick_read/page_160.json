  "text": "Is it possible to have a mind that is incorruptible and alone?  \n\nThis state can lead to a different world and culture.  \n\nThe mind must shed all influences to be completely alone.  \n\nCreativeness arises only in such a state.  \n\nTechniques to influence people are increasingly developed.  \n\nThese include propaganda, compulsion, and idolatry.  \n\nWe are losing our initiative to think originally.  \n\nInfluences prompt conformity and imitation in education and government.  \n\nCreating resistance to one influence means succumbing to another.  \n\nThe mind should rebel to understand controlling influences.  \n\nA mediocre mind seeks order and consistency, leading to confusion.  \n\nThe mind must fathom without fear, not imitate or be shaped.  \n\nSuch a mind should be alone and creative.  \n\nCreativeness is anonymous, not owned by individuals.  \n\nA religious man transforms society by transforming himself.  \n\nHe does not perform rituals or escape facts.  \n\nHe seeks to understand society, which is himself.  \n\nThis requires a complete cessation of greed and ambition.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A truly creative mind must be completely alone and free from external influences to foster genuine transformation in society."
