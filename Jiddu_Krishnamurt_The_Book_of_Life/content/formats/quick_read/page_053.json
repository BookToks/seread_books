  "text": "Desire creates misery, confusion, and false values. \n\nThis leads to a lack of clarity. \n\nI need to understand why desire is so powerful. \n\nDesire is a normal reaction; otherwise, I would be dead. \n\nI see something beautiful and want it. \n\nWithout desire, I would lose my vitality. \n\nHowever, pursuing desire brings pain along with pleasure. \n\nThought increases desire by creating images and ideas. \n\nI can desire something without letting thought interfere. \n\nHave you tried to let go of a pleasure voluntarily? \n\nDying to little pleasures can be liberating. \n\nLife is about abundance and fullness, not ego. \n\nExperimenting with small losses can help your mind. \n\nThe mind must die to all it knows to grow. \n\nA young mind is essential for understanding this truth. \n\nIt can feel the significance of letting go immediately. \n\nListening to this idea plants a seed in the unconscious.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Desire is a natural reaction that must be understood rather than destroyed, as it brings both pleasure and pain, and true clarity comes from experiencing it without the interference of thought."
