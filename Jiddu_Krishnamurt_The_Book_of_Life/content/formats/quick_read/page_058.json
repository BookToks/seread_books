  "text": "Chastity exists only where there is love.  \n\nThe problem of sex is complex.  \n\nIt cannot be solved on its own level.  \n\nSolving it biologically is absurd.  \n\nApproaching it through religion is immature.  \n\nTaboos and condemnations are childish.  \n\nIt requires high intelligence to understand.  \n\nWe seek quick solutions without understanding.  \n\nLove is deeper than mere thought.  \n\nWithout love, life has no meaning.  \n\nWe grow old without maturity.  \n\nReading about love does not mean knowing it.  \n\nWithout love, no law or society will help.  \n\nOnly the man who loves is pure and chaste.  \n\nConstant thought wastes energy.  \n\nSuppressing desires distorts the mind.  \n\nEndless struggle leads to a waste of energy.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Chastity is rooted in love, and understanding the complexities of love requires profound intelligence beyond mere biological or religious perspectives."
