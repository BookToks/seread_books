  "text": "Greed and hate add to the evil within us.  \n\nThis problem of good and evil is always present.  \n\nWe create this duality of wanting and not wanting.  \n\nWe love and hate, crave and renounce constantly.  \n\nThought-feeling can transcend good and evil through understanding craving.  \n\nFreedom from merit and demerit arises from this understanding.  \n\nOpposites cannot fuse; they must be transcended by dissolving craving.  \n\nEach opposite must be deeply thought out and felt.  \n\nThis process awakens comprehension beyond craving and time.  \n\nWe contribute to both good and evil in the world.  \n\nPeople unite more in hate than in goodness.  \n\nA wise person understands the causes of good and evil.  \n\nThey free thought-feeling from these causes.  \n\nThe current world crisis is unprecedented.  \n\nWe now deal with ideas, not just money or things.  \n\nWe justify murder as a means to a noble end.  \n\nEvil cannot bring about good, and war is not a path to peace.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The crisis of good and evil is exacerbated by the justification of immoral actions through ideation, leading to a misunderstanding of true goodness."
