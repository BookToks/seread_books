  "text": "There is a revolt within society or a complete revolution outside it. \n\nA religious revolution is a complete revolution outside of society. \n\nAny non-religious revolution is just a continuation of the old pattern. \n\nCurrent global events reflect a revolt within society. \n\nThis revolt often manifests as crime. \n\nEducation trains youth to fit into society. \n\nIt encourages jobs, money, and conformity. \n\nThis education teaches conformity in various aspects of life. \n\nRevolt without meaning must be suppressed or controlled. \n\nSuch revolt is not creative. \n\nRight education can help free the mind from conditioning. \n\nIt should encourage awareness of influences that cause conformity. \n\nMany claim to know life's purpose. \n\nDifferent groups provide different purposes. \n\nConfusion prevents finding a true answer. \n\nClearing confusion helps discover life's purpose. \n\nWhen clear, the purpose becomes apparent without searching.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Crime arises from societal revolt and the failure of education to foster true understanding and creativity."
