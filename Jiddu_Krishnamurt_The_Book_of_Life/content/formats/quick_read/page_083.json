  "text": "When you focus on understanding a fact, background fades away.  \n\nAwareness exists only in the present moment.  \n\nYou see how the past influences the present and shapes the future.  \n\nAwareness is a complete process, not divided.  \n\nFor instance, asking, “Do I believe in God?” reveals influences behind the question.  \n\nYou can recognize fears from ancestors shaping your idea of God.  \n\nAwareness shows the entire process of influence as a whole.  \n\nIntrospection is incomplete and often painful.  \n\nAwareness brings joy and enthusiasm.  \n\nYou must see a tree as a whole to truly see it.  \n\nIf you only see parts, you miss the tree.  \n\nAwareness of your mind is similar; it requires seeing the whole picture.  \n\nAwareness includes all thoughts and feelings, not just some.  \n\nAre you aware of your mind in this complete sense?\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Awareness is an integral process that allows one to perceive the entirety of their thoughts and experiences, unlike incomplete introspection."
