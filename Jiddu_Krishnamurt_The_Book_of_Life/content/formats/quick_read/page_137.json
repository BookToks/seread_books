  "text": "A fresh mind does not hold many memories. \n\nIt carries no shadow of suffering. \n\nA young mind cannot be acquired or purchased. \n\nIt cannot be obtained through effort or sacrifice. \n\nIf you see its importance, something changes. \n\nHow does a new mind come into being? \n\nWill you use a method or system? \n\nMethods imply repetitive practices aimed at results. \n\nDiscipline is based on methods with predetermined outcomes. \n\nMethods condition the mind to desired results. \n\nYou must discard all mechanical thought processes. \n\nA mechanical mind cannot engage with life fully. \n\nYou need a mind free of time and space. \n\nThis mind must address both immediate and eternal problems. \n\nIt must transform now, without gradual cultivation. \n\nIs it possible to achieve this mind immediately? \n\nIt is not a goal or achievement to aim for.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** A new mind, free from mechanical processes and the constraints of time, is essential for addressing both immediate and eternal challenges in life."
