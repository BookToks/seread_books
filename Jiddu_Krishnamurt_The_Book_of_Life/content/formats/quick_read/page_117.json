  "text": "Training the intellect does not lead to intelligence. \n\nIntelligence arises from harmony between intellect and emotion. \n\nIntellect is thought functioning without emotion. \n\nA trained intellect may be great but lacks intelligence. \n\nIntelligence includes both feeling and reasoning equally. \n\nModern education focuses on developing intellect, not affection. \n\nThis leads to cunning minds that avoid conflict. \n\nThe intellect finds satisfaction in explanations from others. \n\nHowever, intelligence requires unity of mind and heart. \n\nIntellect can corrupt pure feelings of love and generosity. \n\nWhen combined, they result in mediocrity. \n\nMost live mediocre lives by calculating worth and profit. \n\nWe often ignore the beauty of the universe around us. \n\nIntellect cannot solve our problems or nourish us. \n\nIt is limited and conditioned, while sensitivity is not. \n\nSensitivity connects us to everything and reveals truth.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Intelligence arises from the harmonious integration of intellect and emotion, while mere intellectual training leads to a lack of true understanding and sensitivity to life."
