  "text": "Describing the indescribable is not real.  \n\nTranslating the unknowable into the known makes it known.  \n\nWe desire knowledge to find happiness and permanence.  \n\nWe seek to know because we are unhappy and worn out.  \n\nInstead of recognizing our degradation, we chase the unknown.  \n\nThe unknown becomes known, so we never find the real.  \n\nSuffering can be a word or an actuality.  \n\nIf suffering is real, it is intense pain.  \n\nPain relates to an image or experience.  \n\nPleasure exists if you have it; pain exists if you do not.  \n\nSuffering is connected to something, not merely verbalization.  \n\nYou are aware of your suffering; is it separate from you?  \n\nYou are nothing despite your name, title, or possessions.  \n\nYou may avoid this nothingness, but it remains.  \n\nYou must be aware of your escapes from nothingness.  \n\nYou and nothingness are one; you are not separate.  \n\nFear drops away when you experience nothingness as you.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The pursuit of knowledge and understanding often leads to a cycle of suffering and illusion, as true reality cannot be captured or described."
