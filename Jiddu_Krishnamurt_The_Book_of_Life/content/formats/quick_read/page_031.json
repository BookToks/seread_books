  "text": "Many people believe in God and worship Him.  \n\nThey go to the temple daily to avoid facing reality.  \n\nWe often accept beliefs without questioning them.  \n\nThis is not an attack on beliefs.  \n\nWe should understand why we accept them.  \n\nPolitical and religious beliefs create conflict and separation.  \n\nYet, we are reluctant to give them up.  \n\nBeliefs like Hinduism, Christianity, and Buddhism compete with each other.  \n\nThese beliefs create intolerance among people.  \n\nIs it possible to live without any beliefs?  \n\nWe can only find out by studying our relationship to beliefs.  \n\nWe must meet life anew, free from past conditioning.  \n\nWithout beliefs, we might feel lost and frightened.  \n\nFear of emptiness drives us to accept beliefs.  \n\nBeliefs hinder our understanding of ourselves.  \n\nThey act as a screen, preventing true self-reflection.  \n\nRemoving beliefs allows for genuine self-exploration.  \n\nThis is the start of understanding oneself.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Beliefs hinder true understanding of ourselves and create separation and conflict, making it essential to explore the motives behind their acceptance to potentially live without them."
