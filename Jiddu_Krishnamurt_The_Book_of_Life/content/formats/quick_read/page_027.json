  "text": "To deny love is to be a sinner. \n\nThe exploiter thrives in darkness and illusion.  \n\nYou create separation between God and yourself. \n\nThis comes from the mind clinging to the known. \n\nNo ritual or savior can bridge this separation. \n\nThe division exists within yourself, not outside. \n\nUnderstanding desire's conflict is essential. \n\nThis understanding requires self-knowledge and awareness.  \n\nSelf-understanding needs great intelligence and watchfulness. \n\nDesiring to dissolve the self can strengthen it. \n\nCreation occurs when the self is absent. \n\nThe mind must be still for creation to happen. \n\nAny mental movement strengthens the \"me.\" \n\nComplete silence allows for non-recognition. \n\nThe self includes the search for power and authority. \n\nUnderstanding the self is crucial for real revolution. \n\nIndividual love can spark essential change.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The separation between reality and oneself is created by the mind's attachment to the known, and true understanding of the self requires constant awareness and self-knowledge."
