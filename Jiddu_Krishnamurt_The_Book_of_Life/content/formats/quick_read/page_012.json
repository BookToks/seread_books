  "text": "Can you just listen and be free and empty?  \n\nThe mind can be empty by understanding its projections.  \n\nThis understanding must happen daily, moment to moment.  \n\nThen you will find answers and see changes come naturally.  \n\nCreative emptiness is not cultivated; it arrives unexpectedly.  \n\nIn this state, there is a possibility of renewal and revolution.  \n\nRight thinking requires self-knowledge.  \n\nWithout understanding yourself, your thoughts lack truth.  \n\nYou and the world are interconnected, sharing common problems.  \n\nInwardly, we are similar, driven by greed, fear, and ambition.  \n\nWe are one humanity, despite artificial divisions.  \n\nIf you harm another, you harm yourself.  \n\nUnderstanding yourself is essential to understanding reality.  \n\nSelf-knowledge is not found through formulas or professionals.  \n\nIt arises through awareness in relationships.  \n\nRelationships reflect who we truly are.  \n\nMost people struggle to see themselves clearly in relationships.  \n\nThey often judge or justify instead of observing.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Self-knowledge arises from observing oneself in relationships without judgment, revealing the true nature of our being."
