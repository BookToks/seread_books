  "text": "Politicians and religious organizations promise happiness.  \n\nBut we do not have it now.  \n\nThe future is unimportant when I am hungry.  \n\nWe have tried many ways.  \n\nWe can only know love by acting, not through ideas.  \n\nI wonder if evil truly exists.  \n\nWe say there is good and evil.  \n\nWe divide life into good and bad, creating conflict.  \n\nEnvy, hate, and brutality exist in the human heart.  \n\nBut why do we label them as good or evil?  \n\nWhen the mind is attentive, there is no good or evil.  \n\nGoodness is a state of love.  \n\nLove transcends good and bad.  \n\nConflict arises when we lack attention and love.  \n\nCessation of wanting leads to total attention.  \n\nThis state is goodness.  \n\nWe create both good and evil.  \n\nOur thoughts and feelings shape our duality.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The division of life into good and evil creates conflict, and true understanding transcends this duality through love and complete attention."
