  "text": "Spontaneity arises when the intellect is unguarded and fearless. \n\nIt must come from within. \n\nSpontaneous moments are new, unknown, and creative. \n\nThey must be expressed and loved. \n\nIntellect's control has no part in spontaneity. \n\nObserve your emotions. \n\nGreat joy and ecstasy are unpremeditated. \n\nMemory itself has no life. \n\nThought is a response from senses or stored memory. \n\nWithout memory, there are no thoughts. \n\nMemory can be factual or a residue of incomplete experiences. \n\nCompletion of experiences leads to no psychological residue. \n\nUnderstanding is hindered by viewing experiences through past memories. \n\nOur responses to experiences are always conditioned. \n\nConsciousness is not constant; there are intervals between thoughts. \n\nThinking is conditioned by the past and projects into the future. \n\nThe past and future are one state, shaping individual consciousness.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Spontaneity arises when the intellect is unguarded and free from fear, allowing for the expression of the new and creative."
