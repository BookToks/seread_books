  "text": "Sex is a problem because it lacks self-awareness.  \n\nIn that moment, you feel happy and forget the self.  \n\nYou desire more of this happiness and self-abnegation.  \n\nThis desire becomes important because it brings joy.  \n\nEverywhere else, you experience conflict and self-consciousness.  \n\nSelf-consciousness arises from conflict in various aspects of life.  \n\nThe real problem is not sex, but freedom from the self.  \n\nYou have experienced moments without the self.  \n\nWhere the self exists, there is conflict and misery.  \n\nThere is a longing for that self-free state.  \n\nThe problem of sex is not the act itself.  \n\nThinking about sex can create problems, just like food.  \n\nSociety builds up the thought of sex through various means.  \n\nYour mind focuses on sex as a form of escape.  \n\nIt allows temporary self-forgetfulness.  \n\nEverything else emphasizes the self.  \n\nSex becomes complex without understanding the thinking mind.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Sex is perceived as a problem because it represents a moment of self-forgetfulness and happiness, contrasting with the ongoing conflict of self-consciousness in other aspects of life."
