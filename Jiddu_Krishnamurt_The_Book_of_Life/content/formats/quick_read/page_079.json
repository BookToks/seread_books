  "text": "Such an energy is not theoretical. \n\nIntroducing theories when faced with facts is immature. \n\nConsider a man with cancer needing surgery. \n\nIt is pointless to discuss the instruments used. \n\nYou must face the fact of the operation. \n\nSimilarly, the mind must not be enslaved by thought. \n\nAll thought leads to invention, not creation. \n\nGadgets and rockets arise from knowledge and thought. \n\nThought is always conditioned and cannot be free. \n\nOnly energy not produced by thought is creative. \n\nAn idea about energy differs from energy itself. \n\nFormulas for energy quality are not the energy itself. \n\nPure energy exists when the mind has no thought. \n\nThis energy cannot be sought or obtained through methods. \n\nWe must understand the daily energy we waste. \n\nObservation of the world uses energy. \n\nDaily energy can be increased by good food.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The highest form of energy arises from a state of mind free from thought and direction, which can be realized by understanding and observing the daily energy we waste."
