  "text": "We have made sex a problem.  \n\nWhy do we turn everything into a problem?  \n\nWhy do we live with problems?  \n\nWhy not end them?  \n\nSex is a relevant question, but why make life a problem?  \n\nWorking, sex, and feeling all become problems.  \n\nWe think from a fixed point of view.  \n\nWe focus on the periphery instead of the center.  \n\nLife is not superficial; it demands complete living.  \n\nSuperficial living creates superficial reactions and problems.  \n\nProblems exist as long as we live superficially.  \n\nThe “me” and its sensations are the periphery.  \n\nLiving within the mind leads to complications.  \n\nLove is the unknowable.  \n\nIt is realized when the known is transcended.  \n\nLove cannot exist with possessiveness or jealousy.  \n\nTrue love brings peace, mercy, and beauty.  \n\nPossession prevents true love.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** We create problems in life, including sex, by living superficially and from a fixed point of view, which leads to complications and conflicts."
