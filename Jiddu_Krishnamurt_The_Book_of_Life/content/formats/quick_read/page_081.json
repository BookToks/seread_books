  "text": "Attention is limitless and without frontiers.  \n\nWe should focus on attention, not concentration.  \n\nConcentration narrows the mind to a point.  \n\nAttention allows for a broader understanding.  \n\nConcentration limits the mind by boundaries.  \n\nUnderstanding the totality of the mind requires attention.  \n\nKnowledge comes from concentration, but it is limited.  \n\nIn attention, the mind uses knowledge effectively.  \n\nThe whole cannot be perceived through parts alone.  \n\nAttention does not result from concentrated effort.  \n\nComplete attention requires no center for knowledge.  \n\nA concentrated mind seeks self-expansion, creating contradiction.  \n\nForcing attention creates resistance to distractions.  \n\nTrue attention involves total awareness of the object.  \n\nNaming something interrupts complete attention.  \n\nTotal attention leads to transformation and understanding.  \n\nPractice builds concentration, not attention.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Attention is a limitless state of awareness that transcends the boundaries of concentration and knowledge."
