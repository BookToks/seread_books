  "simplified_text": "This isn’t just a weird trend; it’s becoming the usual way things are. When writer Jonathan Franzen wrote an article for the Guardian saying that Twitter is a bad influence on writing, a lot of people made fun of him for being out of touch. The magazine Slate called his complaints a “lonely war on the Internet,” and another writer, Jennifer Weiner, responded in The New Republic, saying, “Franzen is all alone, making rules that only apply to him.” The funny hashtag #JonathanFranzenhates quickly became popular.\n\nI bring up these examples because they show a strange situation. In the last chapter, I said that doing deep work is super important in today’s changing job market. If that’s true, you’d think that not only people who want to succeed but also companies would encourage this skill to get the best from their workers. But as we’ve seen, that’s not happening. Many other ideas are being seen as more important than deep work, like teamwork, quick communication, and being active on social media.\n\nIt’s frustrating that so many trends are valued more than deep work, and to make it worse, many of these trends actually make it harder to focus. For example, open office spaces might help people work together more, but they also create “huge distractions,” according to a study for a British TV show called The Secret Life of Office Buildings. A neuroscientist from the show said, “If you’re just starting to work and a phone rings in the background, it ruins your focus.” Even if you don’t notice it, your brain reacts to distractions.\n\nThe same problems come with real-time messaging. Email can only distract you when you decide to check it, but instant messaging is always on, making interruptions worse. Gloria Mark, a professor at UC Irvine, studies how distractions affect attention. In a well-known study, she and her team watched people working in real offices and found that even a short interruption can really slow down how long it takes to finish a task. “People said this was very harmful,” she noted in a typical academic way.\n\nPutting pressure on content creators to be on social media also hurts their ability to focus. Serious journalists need to concentrate on their work—digging into complex information, finding connections, and writing well—so asking them to stop this deep thinking to post on social media throughout the day is not helpful.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how deep work is becoming less valued in favor of trends like social media and open offices, which create distractions. It highlights how these distractions negatively impact focus and productivity, especially for serious writers and journalists.",
