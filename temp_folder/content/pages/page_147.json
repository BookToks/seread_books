  "simplified_text": "In the next week, send me an email with everything you remember about our talk on the problem. Once I get your message, I’ll create a shared folder for the project and add a document that sums up what you sent, along with my own thoughts from our past discussion. In that document, I’ll point out the two or three best next steps we can take.\n\nAfter that, we can work on those steps for a few weeks and then check in with each other. I think we should plan a phone call for a month from now to discuss this. I’ve listed some dates and times when I’m free for a call. When you reply with your notes, let me know which date and time works best for you, and we’ll consider that a confirmation for the call. I’m excited to tackle this problem together.\n\nThanks for getting back to me. I’ll read the draft of the article and send you an edited version with comments on Friday (the 10th). In the version I send back, I’ll fix what I can and add comments to show you where I think you should make changes. After that, you should have everything you need to finalize and submit the draft, so you don’t need to reply to this or follow up with me unless there’s a problem.\n\nWhen I wrote these examples, I first figured out what project we were talking about. The term “project” can mean big things like working on a research problem, or smaller tasks like setting up a coffee meeting. Then, I took a moment to think about how we can get from where we are now to where we want to be with fewer emails. Finally, I wrote a reply that clearly explains this process and our current status. These examples focus on email replies, but the same idea works when writing a new email from scratch.\n\nUsing a process-focused approach to email can really help save your time and attention. There are two main reasons for this. First, it cuts down on the number of emails in your inbox, sometimes by a lot. For example, scheduling a coffee meeting can quickly turn into many emails if you’re not careful. This means you’ll spend less time in your inbox and use less mental energy when you do check it. Second, a good process-focused message helps keep everything organized.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage discusses how to effectively handle email communication about a project. It emphasizes sending clear summaries, planning calls, and reducing email clutter to save time and mental energy. Using a process-focused approach can help streamline communication and improve efficiency.",
