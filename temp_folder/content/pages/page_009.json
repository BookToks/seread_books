  "simplified_text": "Benn had a plan, but he wasn’t excited about the idea that going back home might be for a long time. He needed to learn a tough skill quickly.\n\nBenn faced a problem that many people have when trying to move up in their careers. Learning something complicated like computer programming needs a lot of focus on hard ideas. This kind of focus is what drove Carl Jung to spend time in the woods near Lake Zurich. Basically, it’s called deep work. But most people today, including Benn, struggle with deep work.\n\n“I was always on the Internet checking my email; I couldn’t help it; it was like an addiction,” Benn said about the time before he quit his finance job. He shared a story about a project where his boss asked him to write a business plan. Benn didn’t know how to do that, so he thought he would read five different plans to figure it out. That was a smart idea, but he had a problem: “I couldn’t stay focused.” There were days when he spent almost all his time—98 percent—just surfing the Web. The business plan project, which could have helped him stand out early in his career, got ignored.\n\nWhen he quit, Benn realized he had trouble with deep work. So, when he decided to learn coding, he knew he had to train his mind to focus better. His method was extreme but worked. “I locked myself in a room with no computer: just textbooks, notecards, and a highlighter.” He highlighted important parts in the programming books, wrote them on notecards, and practiced them out loud. At first, it was tough to stay away from distractions, but Benn had no choice: he had to learn. Over time, he got better at focusing and started spending five or more hours a day in that room, concentrating on learning this difficult skill. “I probably read about eighteen books on the topic by the time I was done,” he remembers.\n\nAfter two months of studying hard, Benn went to the really tough Dev Bootcamp, which was a super intense program for learning Web application programming. (While looking into the program, Benn found a student with a PhD from Princeton who said Dev was “the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.”)\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** Benn struggled to focus while trying to learn programming. He locked himself away to study without distractions, which helped him improve his concentration. After two months, he attended a challenging coding bootcamp to advance his skills.",
