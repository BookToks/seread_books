  "simplified_text": "This passage talks about how a small number of people can create a lot of value in today's economy, especially with the help of technology. It mentions that the owners of machines and technology are making a lot of money from this situation. A venture capitalist even said that everyone wants to have their job because it’s so valuable.\n\nThe main idea is that technology is changing our economy in big ways. There are three groups of people who will do really well in this new economy: those who can work well with smart machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those who have money to invest. While there are other important economic trends, these groups will likely thrive. If you can be part of any of these groups, you’ll probably succeed. If not, you might still do okay, but it could be tougher for you.\n\nNow, the big question is: how can you become part of these winning groups? I have to be honest and say I don’t have a quick way to get rich like some famous investors. But I do believe that anyone can work on the two groups I mentioned. The next step is figuring out how to join them.\n\nTo succeed in the new economy, you need two key skills. First, you should be able to learn difficult things quickly. Second, you need to be able to produce high-quality work fast.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage explains how technology is reshaping the economy, creating opportunities for those who can work with machines and excel in their fields. It emphasizes the importance of quickly mastering skills and producing high-quality work to succeed in this new landscape.",
