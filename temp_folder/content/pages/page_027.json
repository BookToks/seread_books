  "simplified_text": "In a study, some people were asked to solve word puzzles. During one part of the study, the researcher interrupted them and told them to switch to a new task, which was reading résumés and making fake hiring decisions. In other parts, she let them finish the puzzles before moving on. Between these tasks, she used a quick game to see how much focus they still had left from the first task.\n\nThe results were clear: when people had leftover focus from the first task, they did worse on the next one. The more leftover focus they had, the worse they performed. This idea of \"attention residue\" helps explain why someone named Grant is so productive. By focusing on one difficult task for a long time without switching, he avoids the negative effects of leftover attention from other tasks. This means he can work better on that one task.\n\nWhen Grant spends days alone working on a paper, he’s doing it more effectively than a typical professor who gets distracted a lot. Even if you can’t completely copy Grant’s style of working alone, the idea of attention residue is important. It shows that working while distracted can really hurt your performance. It might seem okay to check your emails every ten minutes, but that quick look takes away your focus. Plus, if you see messages you can’t deal with right away, it makes it harder to get back to your main task. This leftover attention from switching tasks can lower your performance.\n\nWhen we look at all this, it’s clear: to do your best work, you need to focus on one task for a long time without distractions. This kind of work is called deep work. If you can’t focus deeply for long periods, it will be tough to reach the high levels of quality and quantity needed to succeed in your career. Unless you are way more talented than your competition, those who can work deeply will outproduce you.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage explains how switching tasks can hurt performance due to \"attention residue.\" Focusing deeply on one task without distractions leads to better results, making it essential for success in work and life.",
