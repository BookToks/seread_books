  "simplified_text": "Let’s start with the first skill. First, we need to remember that we’re used to easy-to-use technology, like Twitter and the iPhone. But these are just consumer products, not serious tools. The smart machines that are changing everything are much harder to understand and use.\n\nTake Nate Silver, for example. He’s great at using complicated technology. But making accurate predictions about elections isn’t as simple as just asking, “Who will get more votes?” He has a huge database of poll results from over 250 different sources. He uses a program called Stata to analyze this data. Learning to use tools like Stata isn’t easy. For instance, here’s a command you need to know to work with a database like Nate’s:\n\nCREATE VIEW cities AS SELECT name, population, altitude FROM capitals UNION SELECT name, population, altitude FROM non_capitals;\n\nDatabases like this use a language called SQL. You send commands like this to get information from them. Knowing how to work with these databases is tricky. The command above creates a “view,” which is like a virtual table that combines data from different tables. Figuring out when and how to create views is a tough skill you need to master to get good results from real-world databases.\n\nStaying with Nate Silver, let’s look at the other technology he uses: Stata. It’s a powerful tool that you can’t just pick up and learn easily. For example, the latest version of Stata has many new features like treatment effects, multilevel GLM, and forecasting. Nate uses this complex software to build detailed models with many parts, using custom settings and calculations.\n\nThe main point here is that smart machines are complicated and hard to learn. To be good at using them, you need to practice and get better at mastering difficult things.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** The passage explains that using complex technology, like databases and statistical software, requires serious skills. It emphasizes that mastering these tools is challenging but necessary for success, using Nate Silver as an example of someone who excels in this area.",
