  "simplified_text": "Point #2: \n\nNo matter how you plan your Internet time, you have to make sure you don’t use the Internet at all during your offline time. \n\nThis sounds easy, but it can get complicated during a regular workday. You might find yourself in an offline block and suddenly remember that you need something important from the Internet to keep working. If your next Internet time isn’t for a while, you could feel stuck. The easy choice is to quickly check online, grab what you need, and then go back to your offline work. \n\nBut you have to fight that urge! The Internet can be really distracting. You might think you’re just checking one important email, but it’s hard not to peek at other “urgent” messages that pop up. If you keep making exceptions, your brain will start to blur the lines between your Internet and offline time, which defeats the purpose of this plan. \n\nSo, it’s super important not to ditch your offline time, even if you feel stuck. If you can, switch to a different offline activity for the rest of that block or take a break. If you really need to finish what you’re working on, then adjust your schedule to start your next Internet block sooner. But don’t jump right back online. Make sure there’s at least a five-minute break before you go back. This small gap helps separate your urge to check the Internet from actually doing it.\n\nPoint #3: \n\nPlanning when to use the Internet at home can help you focus better, too. \n\nIf you’re always on your phone or laptop during your evenings and weekends, it can mess up the progress you made during the workday. Your brain doesn’t really see a difference between work and home when it comes to habits. So, it’s a good idea to keep scheduling your Internet time even after work is done.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To improve focus, avoid using the Internet during offline blocks and resist the urge to check it when stuck. Schedule Internet use at home, too, to maintain progress made during work hours.",
