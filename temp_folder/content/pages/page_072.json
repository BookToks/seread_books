  "simplified_text": "You need to eat enough of the right foods to keep your energy up and do light exercise, like walking, to help clear your mind. Nietzsche once said, “The best ideas come from walking.” You should also think about your environment, like organizing your workspace to make things easier and save energy. To be successful, you need to support your deep work efforts. This support should be set up in a way that you don’t waste mental energy figuring out what you need at the moment.\n\nThese questions can help you start creating your deep work routine. Just remember, it might take some trial and error to find what works for you, so be ready to put in the effort. It’s worth it! Once you find a routine that feels right, it can really make a difference. Deep work is important and shouldn’t be taken lightly. Having a unique ritual around it helps your mind focus and get into a creative zone where you can make meaningful things.\n\nMake Big Moves\n\nIn early 2007, J.K. Rowling was trying hard to finish The Deathly Hallows, the last book in her Harry Potter series. The pressure was huge because this book had to connect all the previous six books in a way that would please millions of fans. Rowling needed to focus deeply, but it was hard to concentrate in her home office in Edinburgh, Scotland. She remembered a day when the window cleaner came, her kids were home, and the dogs were barking. It was too distracting, so she decided to do something drastic to help her focus: she checked into a fancy suite at the Balmoral Hotel in downtown Edinburgh. \n\nRowling thought the hotel was beautiful and didn’t plan to stay long. But after her first day of writing went well, she kept coming back and ended up finishing the last Harry Potter book there. Looking back, it makes sense that she stayed. The hotel was perfect for her work. The Balmoral is one of Scotland’s most luxurious hotels, with beautiful old architecture and a tall clock.\n\n**PAGE SUMMARY:** To work deeply, you need the right food, light exercise, and a good environment. J.K. Rowling found focus by checking into a fancy hotel to finish her last Harry Potter book, showing that sometimes big changes can help you concentrate better.",
